Neural rendering\nis an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from\npreviously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering\nmethods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene\nbecause these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed\nfor quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for\nreconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of\ngeometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view\nsynthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit\nuse of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene\n(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,\nimplicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids\nexplicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational\ncost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the\nscene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth\ninformation of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex\nscenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is\nindependent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines\ngeometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering\nlarge-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than\nusing explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach\ncan potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)\napplications."}

Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value.

Each\nsub-network focuses on a specific aspect of driving, improving efficiency by\nactivating only the most relevant modules during inference. This design also\nenhances safety through modular specialization. CDGMP improves the adaptability\nand robustness of CAVs across diverse traffic scenarios, offering a scalable\nsolution to real-world autonomy challenges. The architectural principles behind\nCDGMP, especially the use of MoE, also provide a strong foundation for other\nhigh-dimensional decision and control tasks. Simulation results (available at\nhttps://youtu.be/_-4OXNHV0UY) demonstrate reliable performance in both lane\nselection and motion planning."}

Efforts to detect and\nmitigate such attacks have focused primarily on the control plane while\ndata-plane signals remain largely overlooked.

This paper\nintroduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents\noperate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading\nagents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across\n61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented\nempirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development.\n  Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software\nengineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in\nbenchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI\ngovernance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review\ntimelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond\nsynthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often\noutperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a\ntrust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code\nsubmission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in\nthree years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics).\n  We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for\nthe SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev\nenables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports\nbuilding the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration.

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically\nevaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.\nThe model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground\ntruth story points.

Therefore, the\nproposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art\nregression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments -\nproviding comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than\nproviding ratings or categorical labels."}

In this context, Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar is capable of penetrating\nthrough such challenging environmental conditions due to the lower frequency\ncomponents within its broad bandwidth. Therefore, UWB radar has emerged as a\npotential sensing technology for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\nin vision-denied environments where optical sensors (e.g. LiDAR, Camera) are\nprone to failure. Existing approaches involving UWB radar as the primary\nexteroceptive sensor generally extract features in the environment, which are\nlater initialized as landmarks in a map. However, these methods are constrained\nby the number of distinguishable features in the environment. Hence, this paper\nproposes a novel method incorporating UWB Angle of Arrival (AOA) measurements\ninto UWB radar-based SLAM systems to improve the accuracy and scalability of\nSLAM in feature-deficient environments. The AOA measurements are obtained using\nUWB anchor-tag units which are dynamically deployed by the robot in featureless\nareas during mapping of the environment. This paper thoroughly discusses\nprevailing constraints associated with UWB AOA measurement units and presents\nsolutions to overcome them. Our experimental results show that integrating UWB\nAOA units with UWB radar enables SLAM in vision-denied feature-deficient\nenvironments."}

We introduce a \\emph{Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion} mechanism\nthat jointly filters these disentangled graphs through a dual-pass strategy,\nenabling effective multimodal integration while mitigating category confusion.\nOur self-supervised alignment objectives further guide the learning process\nwithout requiring labels. Extensive experiments on both multimodal and\nmulti-relational graph datasets demonstrate that DMGC achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse\nsettings.

This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention).

Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA\nrobot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously\ncollecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as\nwell as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that\nincorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data.

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to\nfilter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.\nFurthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our\nagent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the\n\"extinction burst\" phenomenon.

In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a\nlarge-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between\ntheoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes\n8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million\nfrequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a\ncomprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward\nsimulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,\nscalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and\nextensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing\ninnovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in\nreal-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate\nefficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers."}

Diffusion models are commonly\nused for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.\nFirst, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to\nlearn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality\nof the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,\nexisting methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding\nannotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in\nsupervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.\nThe method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation\nof paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional\ndiffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices\nand mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training\nprocess of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show\nthat our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.\nMoreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus\nenhancing the performance of downstream tasks."}

These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a\ndistribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal\nlayers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference\nstage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization\nintegrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for\nenhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of\nStableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg).

On the other\nhand, the more complex and larger semantic image segmentation models become,\nthe more stressed the devices are when processing data. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to implementing semantic communication based on splitting the\nsemantic image segmentation process between a resource constrained transmitter\nand the receiver. This allows saving bandwidth by reducing the transmitted data\nwhile maintaining the accuracy of the semantic image segmentation.\nAdditionally, it reduces the computational requirements at the resource\nconstrained transmitter compared to doing all the semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of\nsimulation-based experiments in terms of different metrics such as\ncomputational resource usage, required bit rate and segmentation accuracy. The\nresults when comparing the proposal with the full semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter show that up to 72% of the bit rate was reduced in the\ntransmission process.
