Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or\noverlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where\nUAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve\nground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex\ncoupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical\noptimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation\n(SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex\n(d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV\npositions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided\nheuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for\ntrajectory optimization.

Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy\nconstraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we\npropose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical\nframework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is\ncomplete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches\noutperform the original (greedy) flex distribution."}

We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make\nprompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48\nresearch and commercial tools. We find that prompt programming is not\nwell-supported: all tasks are done manually, and 16 of the 51 questions --\nincluding a majority of the most important ones -- remain unanswered. Based on\nthis, we outline important opportunities for prompt programming tools."}

A random sample of aprox. 2 million public Scratch projects is mined.\nUsing open-source linters, we extract nine CT scores and 40 code smell\nindicators from these projects. After rigorous pre-processing, we apply\ndescriptive analytics, robust correlation tests, stratified cross-validation,\nand exploratory machine-learning models; qualitative spot-checks contextualize\nquantitative patterns. Impact. The study will deliver the first large-scale,\nfine-grained map linking specific CT competencies to concrete design flaws and\nantipatterns. Results are poised to (i) inform evidence-based curricula and\nautomated feedback systems, (ii) provide effect-size benchmarks for future\neducational interventions, and (iii) supply an open, pseudonymized dataset and\nreproducible analysis pipeline for the research community. By clarifying how\nprogramming habits influence early skill acquisition, the work advances both\ncomputing-education theory and practical tooling for sustainable software\nmaintenance and evolution."}

We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming\nmedical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support.\nLeveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular\ntoolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology\nsegmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful\nregions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning\nthrough image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including\npixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced\nstate-of-the-art components to assess diagnostic relevance and visual\ninterpretability."}

TDR\ncomprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of\ndriving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances\ndexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces\nintensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control\nrequires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a\nreconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable\njoints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through\na pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a\ncontinuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively\nactuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates\nthe inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex\ncoordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated\nand compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further\nrevealed.

The framework is composed\nof three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task\nContrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive\nAttention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual\nfeatures and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal\ninteractions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,\nmulti-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local\ngranularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.\nAdaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting\nmechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,\nthereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public\nbenchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority\nof existing state of the art methods."}

Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,\noverlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its\napplication to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The\nvariability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the\nlabel space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM\nfocuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained\nspatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations\nand cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing\npre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge\nto alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a\nfeature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same\nfeature space and efficiently combine different representations.

In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal\nharmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention\nto multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static\nrefusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when\nharmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety\nvia Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that\nproactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA\nemploys a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,\n(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)\nintent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules\nor classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the\nimage-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks\nincluding SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves\nsubstantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods.

Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets\nwith proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity\nconsistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different\nfrom others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP\nalgorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based\npose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more\nefficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,\na synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets.

Our\nmethod recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable\nreasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format\noptimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This\nenables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic\nwhile simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.\nExperiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority.

Built from real-world driving data, we\nprovide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four\ngrounding attributes -- appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to\nother objects -- bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning. To fully\nexploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding\nframework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a\nMixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different\nmodalities and scene dynamics, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art\nbaselines in event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. We hope\nour dataset and approach will establish a foundation for advancing multimodal,\ntemporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and\nautonomy."}
