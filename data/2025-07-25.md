### [1] [Lumina-mGPT 2.0: Stand-Alone AutoRegressive Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17801)
*Yi Xin,Juncheng Yan,Qi Qin,Zhen Li,Dongyang Liu,Shicheng Li,Victor Shea-Jay Huang,Yupeng Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Le Zhuo,Tiancheng Han,Xiaoqing Sun,Siqi Luo,Mengmeng Wang,Bin Fu,Yuewen Cao,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Qiao,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 是一个从头训练的自回归模型，支持多种任务，性能媲美或超越现有扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视并振兴自回归范式，以实现高质量的图像生成及其他任务，同时避免依赖预训练组件或混合架构。

Method: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 是一个独立的、仅解码器的自回归模型，采用统一的标记化方案和高效的解码策略（如推理时间缩放和推测性 Jacobi 采样）。

Result: 在标准文本到图像基准测试（如 GenEval、DPG）上表现优异，甚至在某些情况下超过基于扩散的模型，同时在 Graph200K 基准测试中展现出多任务能力。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 是一个强大的、灵活的多模态生成基础模型，其性能在某些情况下超过基于扩散的模型，并且支持广泛的任务。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV3.3B是一种轻量级视频理解模型，通过创新方法提升运动视频分析的细粒度和效率，性能优于GPT-4o且计算需求更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动视频分析方法计算密集且缺乏对运动细节的细粒度理解，无法捕捉关键的运动阶段。

Method: 结合了DWT-VGG16-LDA关键帧提取机制、V-DWT-JEPA2编码器和LLM解码器，通过自监督学习和掩码去噪目标进行预训练。

Result: 在NSVA篮球数据集上，SV3.3B在文本生成和运动特定评估标准上均优于GPT-4o，信息密度、动作复杂性和测量精度等指标显著提升。

Conclusion: SV3.3B模型在运动视频分析领域表现出色，不仅超越了GPT-4o等闭源模型，还在计算资源需求上显著降低，适用于设备端部署。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++通过分阶段生成和质心对齐损失，有效提升复杂提示下的文本到图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理涉及多对象及其属性的复杂提示时面临挑战，受人类绘画过程的启发，提出分阶段生成方法以改善这一局限。

Method: 提出了一种训练自由的框架Detail++，采用渐进式细节注入（PDI）策略，将复杂提示分解为简化子提示序列，分阶段引导生成过程。利用自注意力的布局控制能力确保全局构图，再通过精确细化实现细节。引入跨注意力机制和测试时的质心对齐损失以减少绑定噪声。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和新构建的风格组合基准测试中，Detail++显著优于现有方法，特别是在多对象和复杂风格条件下。

Conclusion: Detail++通过其渐进式细节注入策略和质心对齐损失，显著提升了处理复杂提示时的文本到图像生成性能，尤其在多对象和复杂风格场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

### [4] [FishDet-M: A Unified Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Fish Detection and CLIP-Guided Model Selection in Diverse Aquatic Visual Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17859)
*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishDet-M是最大的鱼类检测统一基准，整合了13个数据集，评估了28种模型，并引入基于CLIP的模型选择框架，为水下目标检测提供了标准化平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于水下图像中鱼类检测的碎片化数据集、异构成像条件和不一致的评估协议，实际应用受到限制。FishDet-M旨在填补这些空白，为生态监测、水产养殖自动化和机器人感知提供统一基准。

Method: 研究提出了FishDet-M基准，整合了13个公开数据集，采用COCO风格的注释（包括边界框和分割掩码），并系统性地评估了28种当代目标检测模型（涵盖YOLOv8至YOLOv12系列、R-CNN和DETR模型）。此外，还引入了一个基于CLIP的模型选择框架，用于动态选择最合适的检测器。

Result: 研究结果表明，不同模型在FishDet-M上的检测性能存在差异，且不同架构的模型在准确性和效率之间存在权衡。基于CLIP的零样本选择策略在不需集成计算的情况下实现了高性能。

Conclusion: FishDet-M提供了一个标准化且可复现的平台，用于评估复杂水生场景中的目标检测性能，所有数据集、预训练模型和评估工具均已公开，以促进水下计算机视觉和智能海洋系统的未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用生成AI模型LightningDiT生成合成数据评估黑色素瘤分类器的公平性，发现合成数据在公平性评估中具有潜力，但需注意数据一致性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在边缘计算中的应用为皮肤癌筛查带来革命性潜力，但潜在偏见风险需评估和改进。公平性评估的关键挑战在于确保数据集充分代表不同PII（性别、年龄、种族）和少数群体。

Method: 利用最先进的生成AI模型LightningDiT生成高度真实的合成数据，评估公开可用的黑色素瘤分类器的公平性。

Result: 研究表明，使用高度真实的合成数据进行公平性评估是可行的方向，但当评估模型训练数据与合成数据基础不一致时，验证公平性变得困难。

Conclusion: 本研究提出利用合成数据评估和提升医学影像生成AI系统的公平性，尽管在评估模型与合成数据基础不一致时存在挑战，但为公平性评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiNAT-IR combines Dilated Neighborhood Attention with a channel-aware module to efficiently balance global and local context for high-quality image restoration, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of self-attention in Transformers limits scalability to high-resolution images, and existing approaches like Restormer may overlook localized artifacts crucial for high-quality image restoration.

Method: The paper introduces DiNAT-IR, which integrates Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) with a channel-aware module to balance global context and local precision for image restoration.

Result: DiNAT-IR achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in diverse low-level computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based architecture designed for image restoration, achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for diverse low-level computer vision problems.

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [7] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFR模块通过高低分辨率特征和高频组件优化UDA-SS任务，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA-SS方法难以平衡局部细节与全局上下文，导致复杂区域分割错误。

Method: 引入Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR)模块，通过语义先验和高频组件优化特征，并结合不确定性驱动的注意力机制平衡局部与全局信息。

Result: 在GTA V→Cityscapes和Synthia→Cityscapes数据集上分别提升1.05%和1.04%的mIoU。

Conclusion: 论文提出的AFR模块通过结合高低分辨率特征和高频组件，有效提升了UDA-SS任务的性能，实现了1.05%和1.04%的mIoU提升。

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [8] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OPEN是一个专注于老年人在虚拟康复学习中参与度识别的新数据集，支持AI研究，识别准确率达81%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟学习中的参与度对参与者满意度、表现和坚持性至关重要，但在虚拟团体环境中准确测量参与度仍是一个挑战。现有方法往往忽视上下文相关性和跨会话的纵向参与度。

Method: 该论文引入了OPEN数据集，支持AI驱动的参与度识别。数据集包含从11名老年人在六周内每周参与的虚拟团体学习课程中收集的数据，包括面部、手部和身体关节标志，以及从视频中提取的情感和行为特征。

Result: 通过训练多种机器学习和深度学习模型，实现了高达81%的参与度识别准确率。

Conclusion: OPEN数据集为老年人群体的个性化参与度建模提供了可扩展的基础，并为更广泛的参与度识别研究做出了贡献。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

*Arsen Yermukan,Pedro Machado,Feliciano Domingos,Isibor Kennedy Ihianle,Jordan J. Bird,Stefano S. K. Kaburu,Samantha J. Ward*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于YOLO的自动化系统，用于实时监测鬃狮蜥的晒太阳和狩猎行为，YOLOv8s表现最佳，但狩猎检测因蟋蟀识别不足而准确性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监测鬃狮蜥行为的耗时且易出错，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用五种YOLO变体（v5、v7、v8、v11、v12）在包含1200张图像的自定义公开数据集上进行训练，选择YOLOv8s作为最优模型，并通过逐帧对象坐标提取、时间插值和基于规则的逻辑分类特定行为。

Result: YOLOv8s在准确性和速度上表现最佳（mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855），晒太阳检测可靠，但狩猎检测准确性较低（蟋蟀检测mAP@0.5 = 0.392）。

Conclusion: 该自动化系统为受控环境中监测爬行动物行为提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提高了研究效率和数据质量。

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个空中-地面跨模态视频人员重识别数据集AG-VPReID.VIR，并设计了TCC-VPReID三流架构，显著提升了跨模态和跨平台的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注地面视角，存在遮挡、覆盖范围有限和易受阻碍等问题，而空中视角可以解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种三流架构TCC-VPReID，通过风格鲁棒特征学习、基于记忆的跨视角适应和中介引导的时间建模来解决跨平台和跨模态的挑战。

Conclusion: AG-VPReID.VIR数据集和TCC-VPReID框架为跨模态和跨平台的人员重识别提供了新的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at
https://github.com/agvpreid25/AG-VPReID.VIR.

*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨医学影像数据中标签偏差对深度学习模型特征学习和性能的影响，发现子组大小和可分离性是关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据集中特定子组的系统性错误标签（标签偏差）是一个未被充分研究的医学AI公平性问题。

Method: 使用EMory BrEast成像数据集（EMBED）训练深度学习模型，模拟子组标签偏差，研究其对模型学习特征和性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，标签偏差导致模型学习特征表示显著变化，且这些变化取决于受标签偏差影响的子组的相对大小和可分离性。此外，验证集标签是否清洁对子组性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解医学影像AI中标签偏差对子组公平性的影响做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文首次推导出Grassmannian特征之间关于刚体变换的可优化成本函数，并通过数学证明验证其有效性，应用于配准问题表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Grassmannian方法只能测量特征之间的接近度，而无法将距离表示为刚体变换的显式函数，这限制了其在配准问题中的应用。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于高维线性子空间基的显式表示方法，并推导了一个可优化的成本函数，该函数可以应用于任何仿射子空间的配准问题。

Result: 提出的成本函数及其扩展在多个计算机视觉任务中提高了现有解决方案的收敛性或表现优于它们。

Conclusion: 该论文首次明确推导出了一个关于刚体变换（$\mathbf{R}$ 和 $\mathbf{t}$）的可优化成本函数，用于Grassmannian特征之间的距离度量，并通过数学证明验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

Result: GRR-CoCa在预训练和三个多样化微调数据集上均显著优于基线CoCa，预训练中对比损失降低27.25%，困惑度提升3.71%，CoCa损失降低7.15%；微调平均对比损失降低13.66%，困惑度提升5.18%，CoCa损失降低5.55%。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa通过结合高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化和旋转位置嵌入等LLM先进架构技术，显著提升了CoCa模型的性能和多模态任务泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Gaussian inpainting framework using mask refinement and uncertainty-guided optimization improves 3D scene inpainting, outperforming existing methods in quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inpainting 3D scenes is challenging due to irregular 3D structures and the need for multi-view consistency, which current methods struggle to achieve.

Method: The framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization, including Gaussian scene filtering, back-projection, and fine-grained optimization to localize occluded regions and restore boundaries.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and view consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D Gaussian inpainting framework effectively addresses the challenges of 3D scene inpainting by leveraging sparse inpainted views, achieving superior visual quality and multi-view consistency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: ViGText是一种结合视觉与文本解释的图框架方法，显著提升深度伪造检测的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法在处理复杂定制化深度伪造内容时，泛化能力和鲁棒性不足，ViGText通过整合视觉大语言模型（VLLM）文本解释与图框架，提供更上下文感知的分析。

Method: ViGText将图像分割为多个区块，构建图像和文本图，并利用图神经网络（GNNs）进行分析，结合空间和频率域的多层次特征提取，以捕捉增强鲁棒性和准确性的细节。

Result: ViGText在泛化评估中将平均F1分数从72.45%提升至98.32%，在面对针对性攻击时，分类性能下降控制在4%以内，召回率比其他方法提高了11.1%。

Conclusion: ViGText通过结合视觉和文本解释的图框架，显著提升了深度伪造检测的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为媒体真实性和信息完整性设立了新标准。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉地点识别（VPR）在移动机器人定位中至关重要，但在不同环境条件和视角下保持可靠性能面临挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一个结合Dual-Scale-Former（DSFormer）和块聚类策略的新框架。DSFormer通过双向信息传递增强特征表示，块聚类策略则优化数据组织以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，超越了DELG、Patch-NetVLAD等先进方法，同时显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的结合DSFormer和块聚类策略的新框架，不仅适应环境变化产生鲁棒的全局嵌入，还减少了约30%的训练数据需求，并在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: TAV数据集通过后训练提升AI模型在长视频生成中的场景转换能力，改善多场景视频的连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成的视频在文本到视频任务中表现良好，但生成长视频时难以保持连贯的场景转换，主要因为无法从提示中推断何时需要转换。

Method: 提出了Transition-Aware Video (TAV)数据集，包含预处理的多场景转换视频剪辑，并进行了后训练实验。

Result: 实验表明，使用TAV数据集后训练能提升模型对场景转换的理解能力，改善多场景视频生成效果。

Conclusion: 通过后训练在TAV数据集上，模型在基于提示的场景转换理解方面有所提升，缩小了所需与生成场景之间的差距，并保持了图像质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Result: BokehDiff 实现了高质量和高保真度的渲染效果，并通过合成具有透明度的光真实前景，解决了可扩展配对数据缺乏的问题。

Conclusion: BokehDiff 提出了一种新颖的镜头模糊渲染方法，通过生成扩散先验实现了物理准确且视觉上吸引人的效果，解决了现有方法在深度不连续处产生伪影的问题。

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D软件生成方法通常将3D环境作为一个整体生成，无法修改或控制特定元素，且难以处理现实世界中复杂的空间和语义约束。

Method: Scenethesis基于ScenethesisLang，一种领域特定语言，作为细粒度约束感知的中间表示，将自然语言需求与可执行的3D软件桥接起来。通过将3D软件合成分解为多个阶段，实现了独立验证、针对性修改和系统性约束满足。

Result: Scenethesis能够准确捕捉80%以上的用户需求，并满足90%以上的硬约束，同时处理超过100个约束。在BLIP-2视觉评估中，Scenethesis比现有最优方法提升了42.8%的得分。

Conclusion: Scenethesis 提供了一种新颖的需求敏感型3D软件合成方法，通过ScenethesisLang作为中间表示，实现了用户需求与生成3D软件之间的形式化可追溯性，显著提升了3D软件生成的准确性和约束处理能力。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: VLM-IMI 通过结合视觉语言模型和迭代手动指令，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果，尤其在复杂光照条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

Result: 在公共胰腺内镜超声数据库中，TextSAM-EUS在自动提示下达到82.69% Dice和85.28% NSD，手动几何提示下达到83.10% Dice和85.70% NSD，优于现有SOTA监督DL模型和基础模型（如SAM及其变体）。

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS是一种轻量级、文本驱动的SAM适配方法，无需手动几何提示即可实现胰腺肿瘤的自动分割，为EUS分割提供了高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in

cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive

outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain

difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the

models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出Free-Energy Posterior Network，通过自由能和Beta分布联合建模OoD区域，显著提升了语义分割中的不确定性估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如MC Dropout）在OoD检测中仅关注模型或数据不确定性，未能与语义目标对齐，因此需要一种更高效且语义明确的方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于自由能的后验网络框架，结合Beta分布参数化的密度估计器和集成损失函数，直接从未知区域学习不确定性。

Result: 在Fishyscapes、RoadAnomaly和Segment-Me-If-You-Can等基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，实现了更高的不确定性估计精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新颖的框架Free-Energy Posterior Network，通过联合建模分布不确定性和识别OoD区域，提高了语义分割中的不确定性估计效率和准确性。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Conclusion: WaveMamba通过有效融合RGB和IR图像的频率特征，显著提升了目标检测性能，平均mAP提高了4.5%。

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

Abstract: Object detection and classification are crucial tasks across various
application domains, particularly in the development of safe and reliable
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of

Motivation: 解决3D LiDAR语义分割因领域偏移（如传感器类型、地理位置）导致的性能下降问题，同时避免手动标注目标域数据的高成本。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段框架：首先通过无监督对比学习预训练骨干网络以学习领域不变特征；随后采用多模型伪标签策略，集成多种先进架构的预测结果，通过硬投票生成高质量伪标签，并用于微调预训练网络。

Result: 在从SemanticKITTI到SemanticPOSS和SemanticSlamantic的无标注目标域数据集上，分割精度显著优于直接迁移和单模型UDA方法。

Conclusion: 结合对比预训练和精炼的集成伪标签策略，该方法在无需目标域标注的情况下有效缩小了复杂领域差距，显著提高了分割精度。

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba是一种结合UNet和mamba机制的新架构，通过噪声减少模块提升医学图像分割性能，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺场景下，深度学习模型容易过拟合噪声和无关模式，限制了其在未见样本上的泛化能力，尤其是在医学图像分割任务中。

Method: Diff-UMamba结合了UNet框架和mamba机制，利用噪声减少模块（NRM）通过信号差分策略抑制编码器中的噪声或无关激活，从而增强模型对临床相关区域的关注。

Result: Diff-UMamba在多个公开数据集（如MSD、AIIB23）上表现优于基线方法，性能提升1-3%；在BraTS-21数据集和内部NSCLC数据集上，分别验证了其在有限数据条件下的鲁棒性，性能提升达4-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba架构通过结合UNet框架和mamba机制，特别是在编码器中引入噪声减少模块（NRM），显著提升了在数据稀缺场景下的医学图像分割性能，并在多个公开数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: MatSSL 是一种自监督学习架构，通过 Gated Feature Fusion 整合多级表示，能在小规模未标注数据上有效适应金属材料领域，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金属材料的显微图像分析依赖于监督方法，需要针对每个新数据集重新训练，且在少量标注样本下表现不稳定。自监督学习虽有望利用未标注数据，但现有方法仍需大规模数据集才能有效。MatSSL 旨在克服这一限制。

Method: 采用 Gated Feature Fusion 在骨干网络的每个阶段整合多级表示，先在小规模未标注数据集上进行自监督预训练，然后在多个基准数据集上微调模型。

Result: 在 MetalDAM 数据集上达到 69.13% mIoU，优于 ImageNet 预训练编码器的 66.73%，并在 EBC 基准数据集上平均 mIoU 提升近 40%。

Conclusion: MatSSL 通过自监督学习在小规模未标注数据上有效适应金属材料领域，同时保留从大规模自然图像预训练中学习到的丰富且可迁移的特征。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

Conclusion: TeEFusion 是一种高效的知识蒸馏方法，通过将引导幅度直接融入文本嵌入并简化采样策略，显著提升了推理速度（最高6倍），同时保持了与复杂采样方法相当的图像质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: LEAF模型通过改进潜在扩散模型的微调过程，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能，且不增加模型架构、参数或推理计算量，具有高效性。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

Conclusion: GSDTTA 通过将适应过程转移到图谱域，显著提高了 3D 点云分类的效率与性能，超越了现有 TTA 方法。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

Conclusion: DepthDark 提出了一种针对低光环境下单目深度估计的鲁棒基础模型，通过创新的数据集生成方法和参数高效微调策略，显著提升了模型在低光条件下的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragility of current ISTD methods in real-world challenges due to reliance on large manual-labeling data.

Method: Introduces Gaussian Group Squeezer for non-uniform quantization and two-stage diffusion models for real-world reconstruction.

Result: The approach significantly improves the quality and fidelity of synthetic samples, demonstrating superior performance in scarcity scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning and two-stage diffusion models effectively enhance the resilience and quality of ISTD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various scarcity scenarios.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: LONG3R 是一种专为长序列流式多视图3D场景重建设计的新型模型，其在保持实时推理速度的同时，显著优于现有流式方法，特别是在长序列处理上。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

Method: 研究采用了五种代表性的半监督语义分割（SemiSeg）算法，分别在卷积网络和Transformer两种架构上实现，并在域内和跨域两种设置下进行评估。此外，还提出了ECG特定的训练配置和增强策略，并引入了标准化的评估框架。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的基准测试为半监督心电图（ECG）描绘方法的发展奠定了基础，并有望推动该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Motivation: 探索牙科特征（牙周炎、龋齿）与肺癌亚型之间的因果关系，并评估肺功能的中介作用。

Method: 采用两样本孟德尔随机化（MR）方法，使用逆方差加权作为主要分析方法，肺功能中介效应通过delta方法评估。

Result: 龋齿对整体肺癌及其亚型有显著正向因果效应，尤其是鳞状细胞肺癌（OR=2.880）。肺功能（FVC和FEV1）下降部分中介了这种效应（5.124%和5.890%）。未发现牙周炎的因果效应。

Conclusion: 研究强调了龋齿在肺癌风险中的因果作用，并支持将牙科护理和肺功能监测纳入癌症预防策略。

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Motivation: 由于环境噪声、重叠发声和缺失标签等问题，现有模型在低信噪比或多物种录音中表现不佳。假设鸟类可以通过其音高模式、速度和重复（称为motifs）进行分类。

Method: 提出了一种通过主色添加剂将频率信息嵌入声谱图的方法，以增强物种间的区分度。

Conclusion: 通过将频率信息以色彩化形式嵌入声谱图，显著提高了鸟类物种分类的准确性，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型多模态模型（LMMs）具备无需额外检测模块的检测能力，LMM-Det方法通过数据分布调整和推理优化有效提升了检测召回率。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在视觉和文本理解任务上表现出色，但其在科学领域（尤其是复杂实地数据解释）的应用仍不足。

Method: FieldLVLM包含两个主要组件：领域感知语言生成策略和数据压缩多模态模型调优。前者通过专用机器学习管道提取关键物理特征并转换为结构化文本描述；后者通过数据压缩策略简化输入，保留最有信息量的值。

Result: 在新提出的基准数据集上，FieldLVLM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FieldLVLM框架显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在科学领域数据理解上的表现，为将此类模型应用于科学研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

Conclusion: Rein-EAD框架在3D对抗环境中显著降低了攻击成功率，并在保持标准准确性的同时展现出对未见和自适应攻击的鲁棒性，适用于现实世界的复杂任务。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

Result: 建立了包含3000个手动验证样本的黄金标准基准，用于评估深度认知视频理解，并发布了模型（如InternVideo、VAST、UMT-L）的评估结果。

Conclusion: VideoMind数据集作为一个强大的基准，推动了细粒度跨模态对齐和深入视频理解的领域发展，如情感和意图识别。

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.
The data is publicly available on GitHub, HuggingFace, and OpenDataLab,

Conclusion: SGCDet通过自适应3D体积构建和多视角信息动态整合，实现了高效且有效的室内3D物体检测，并在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

Motivation: 低光图像增强任务在极端光照退化下难以保持物体边缘连续性和精细结构细节，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出DRWKV模型，结合Global Edge Retinex（GER）理论、Evolving WKV Attention机制和Bilateral Spectrum Aligner（Bi-SAB）及MS2-Loss，有效解耦光照与边缘结构，提升边缘保真度。

Result: 在五个LLIE基准测试中，DRWKV在PSNR、SSIM和NIQE上表现领先，且计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: DRWKV模型在低光图像增强任务中表现出色，不仅在PSNR、SSIM和NIQE等指标上领先，还提升了低光多目标跟踪任务的性能，验证了其泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

TL;DR: SynC 是一个专为精炼合成图像-描述数据集设计的框架，通过重新分配描述至语义最匹配的图像，显著提升了零样本图像描述的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据集修剪技术主要针对网络爬取数据中的噪声文本设计，不适用于合成数据中图像可能不准确的问题。

Method: SynC 采用了一种一对多的映射策略，首先为每个描述检索多个相关候选图像，然后通过循环一致性启发的对齐评分器选择最佳图像。

Result: SynC 在各种 ZIC 模型上显著提升了性能，在多个标准基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SynC 提供了一种有效策略，通过精炼合成数据来增强零样本图像描述（ZIC）的性能，并在多个标准基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够跨视角（自我视角和他人视角）传递和整合知识，而现有 MLLMs 的跨视角推理能力尚未被探索。

Method: 通过构建包含 7,300 多个问答对的 EgoExoBench 基准测试，评估了 13 种最先进的 MLLMs 在 11 个子任务中的表现。

Result: 研究发现，尽管 MLLMs 在单视角任务中表现优异，但在跨视角语义对齐、视角关联和时间推理方面表现较差。

Conclusion: EgoExoBench 是首个用于评估 MLLMs 在自我视角和他人视角视频理解与推理能力的基准测试，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

Method: 提出SIDA方法，通过生成合成图像并应用Domain Mix和Patch Style Transfer模块来模拟目标域风格。

Conclusion: SIDA方法通过利用合成图像和创新的模块（Domain Mix和Patch Style Transfer），在零样本域适应中实现了最先进的性能和高效率。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Result: 在相同配置和统一框架下，GDCUnet在公共数据集上达到了最先进的性能，消融实验验证了模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的可变形卷积模块通过解耦核大小和学习网络，能够显著学习复杂特征，增强模型表示和泛化能力，建议将其应用于更多具有复杂全局自相似特征的机器视觉任务。

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

Motivation: 现有姿态生成方法依赖中间表示或自回归模型，导致性能下降，特别是在需要保持时间一致性的长期姿态生成中。

Method: 通过相对运动预测机制和统一的占位符标记方法，直接在姿态坐标上操作，保持空间关系，并在训练和推理中实现单次前向生成。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的一阶段架构，直接从最小上下文（单张RGB图像和文本描述）生成连续坐标空间中的姿态，避免了中间表示或基于标记的生成，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Result: 在OpenHumanBRDF数据集和真实数据上的广泛实验表明，该方法在材料估计方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过构建高质量数据集（OpenHumanBRDF）和设计渐进式训练策略的模型（HumanMaterial），显著提升了材料估计的性能，并在实验中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future

Motivation: 现有深度网络在集成连接性时，通常强制将其作为附加特征模块注入，导致特征空间耦合且缺乏标准化机制来量化不同特征的强度。

Method: 提出了 DCFFSNet（双连接特征融合-分离网络），引入特征空间解耦策略，量化连接性特征与其他特征的相对强度，并构建深度连接性特征融合-分离架构。

Result: 在 ISIC2018、DSB2018 和 MoNuSeg 数据集上的实验表明，DCFFSNet 在所有指标上均优于现有主流方法，Dice 和 IoU 分数均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DCFFSNet 通过创新的特征空间解耦策略和动态平衡多尺度特征表达，显著提升了医学图像分割的边缘精度和区域一致性，有效解决了分割碎片化问题，增强了临床实用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Motivation: 现有数据集在基于外部视觉证据描述和解释一般车辆运动方面存在局限，需要更详细地理解个性化驾驶行为并提升MLLMs在驾驶理解和推理方面的能力。

Method: 提出了一个基准PDB-Eval，包含两个主要组件：PDB-X用于评估MLLMs对时间驾驶场景的理解，PDB-QA作为视觉解释问答任务用于MLLM指令微调。

Result: 微调MLLMs在细粒度描述和解释上显著提升了零样本问答任务的性能（最高提升73.2%），并在Brain4Cars和AIDE任务中实现了性能提升（最高12.5%和11.0%）。

Conclusion: 通过微调MLLMs在细粒度描述和解释上，可以有效地缩小MLLMs与驾驶领域之间的差距，显著提升零样本问答任务的性能（最高提升73.2%）。此外，在Brain4Cars和AIDE任务中也观察到了性能提升（最高12.5%和11.0%）。

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Conclusion: The Q-Former Autoencoder framework demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained vision foundation models for unsupervised medical anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art results without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc通过创新的传感器融合机制和3D高斯表示，显著提升了语义占用预测的准确性和效率，优于现有最先进模型。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: IntentVCNet通过时空知识统一和先验信息增强，显著提升了模型在意图导向视频描述生成中的性能。

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

Motivation: EDM虽然阐明了扩散模型的统一设计空间，但其固定的纯高斯噪声模式限制了图像恢复的进展。研究表明，强制注入高斯噪声会破坏退化图像，延长图像变换距离，并增加恢复的复杂性。因此，提出了EDA来解决这一问题。

Method: EDA扩展了EDM（Elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models）的设计空间，允许使用任意噪声模式，而不仅限于纯高斯噪声。通过理论证明，EDA在保持模块灵活性的同时，增加了噪声模式的自由度，且不增加恢复过程中的计算开销。

Result: EDA在MRI偏置场校正（全局平滑噪声）、CT金属伪影减少（全局锐利噪声）和自然图像阴影去除（局部边界感知噪声）三个任务中验证了其有效性。仅需5次采样步骤，EDA就超越了大多数任务特定方法，并在偏置场校正和阴影去除中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EDA（Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models）通过扩展噪声模式的自由度，同时保留了EDM的模块灵活性，并在理论上证明了增加噪声复杂性不会在恢复过程中带来额外的计算开销。EDA在MRI偏置场校正、CT金属伪影减少和自然图像阴影去除三个典型任务中表现出色，仅需5次采样步骤即可超越大多数任务特定方法，并在偏置场校正和阴影去除中达到最先进的性能。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉生成模型在训练和计算资源上的高成本问题，同时提升测试时扩展的性能。

Method: 提出了TTS-VAR框架，将生成过程建模为路径搜索问题，采用自适应批量大小调度，并结合聚类多样性搜索和重采样潜力选择。

Result: 在Infinity模型上实现了8.7%的GenEval分数提升（从0.69到0.75）。

Conclusion: TTS-VAR框架通过自适应批量大小调度、聚类多样性搜索和重采样潜力选择，显著提升了视觉自回归模型的生成质量，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合MVS先验和概率Procrustes映射的无标定3DGS框架，解决了现有方法在内存和精度上的限制，实现了高效的全局对齐和准确重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MVS模型在无标定重建任务中面临内存限制和输入图像增多时的精度下降问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的无标定3DGS重建框架，结合了预训练MVS先验与概率Procrustes映射策略。通过分区输入图像、映射子图到全局空间，并联合优化几何与姿态。技术细节包括将点云映射建模为概率Procrustes问题，采用封闭式对齐，以及使用概率耦合和软垃圾箱机制拒绝不确定对应。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能够在数百张图像中快速全局对齐点云和姿态，并在未标定图像序列上实现准确重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了从未标定图像序列的准确重建，为无标定3D高斯泼溅重建设立了新的技术标准。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该方法在ReMIND数据集上表现出色，平均精度达69.8%，注册误差为2.39 mm，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

Motivation: 现有去变形方法存在变形复制问题，且通常假设训练和测试使用的变形技术相同，这限制了方法的通用性和实用性。

Method: 该方法在潜在空间中分解变形图像，训练时使用合成面部生成的变形图像，测试时则处理通过任意变形技术生成的真实面部变形图像。

Result: 该方法在去变形任务中表现显著优于现有方法，能够处理不同变形技术和面部风格，生成高保真的去变形结果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在潜在空间中分解变形图像，能够处理未见过的变形技术和面部风格，显著优于现有方法，并生成高保真的去变形面部图像。

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

Motivation: 解决Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD)依赖反向KL散度最小化可能导致模式崩溃的问题。

Method: 提出了Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM)框架，利用基于扩散的判别器以对抗方式对齐真实和虚假分数估计器的潜在预测，并在一步蒸馏中结合潜在和像素空间的混合判别器改进预训练生成器。

Result: DMDX在SDXL上的一步生成性能优于DMD2，且GPU时间更少；在多步ADM蒸馏实验中，SD3-Medium、SD3.5-Large和CogVideoX的性能达到新高度。

Conclusion: DMDX框架通过结合对抗性蒸馏预训练和ADM微调，在SDXL上实现了一步生成性能的显著提升，同时在SD3-Medium、SD3.5-Large和CogVideoX上为高效图像和视频合成设定了新基准。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

<details>

Motivation: Transformer 在 3D 语义分割中表现强大，但二次复杂度限制了其在大规模点云中建模长距离依赖的能力；Mamba 虽具有线性复杂度，但在 3D 特征提取中表现不足。如何有效结合两者的优势是一个开放挑战。

Method: 提出了 HybridTM，一种结合 Transformer 和 Mamba 的混合架构，并引入了 Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy，以更细粒度结合注意力机制和 Mamba，同时捕捉长距离依赖和局部细粒度特征。

Result: HybridTM 在 ScanNet、ScanNet200 和 nuScenes 基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HybridTM 通过结合 Transformer 和 Mamba 的优势，在 3D 语义分割任务中实现了最先进的性能，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

Method: 研究引入了四种泛化设置的数据集，评估了特征相似性基线、对比风格描述符、数据归因方法、监督分类器和少样本原型网络。

Result: 研究发现，监督和少样本模型在已知艺术家和复杂提示上表现优异，而风格描述符在艺术家风格明显时转移效果更好；多艺术家提示仍然最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该论文的基准测试揭示了文本到图像模型在识别提示艺术家方面的显著改进空间，并提供了一个公开测试平台，以促进对这些模型的负责任管理。

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Conclusion: Captain Cinema框架在高质量和高效率地自动创建视觉连贯且叙事一致的短电影方面表现优越。

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

Motivation: 解决SN9中每个矿工需本地完整模型和‘赢家通吃’奖励机制导致模型囤积的问题。

Method: 提出了IOTA架构，包括数据与管道并行的SWARM架构、细粒度连续激励机制、激活压缩技术、Butterfly All-Reduce算法以及CLASP公平贡献评估方案。

Result: 实现了模型规模随参与者数量扩展、通信带宽降低128倍、线性可扩展性及公平贡献评估。

Conclusion: IOTA架构通过将分布式网络中的竞争者转变为合作单元，解决了SN9的核心问题，实现了模型的任意扩展和公平奖励。

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

TL;DR: PolyServe 是一种多 SLO 调度策略，通过分组请求和智能调度，显著提升了 SLO 达成率和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的系统将工作负载简单地分类为延迟敏感（LS）或尽力而为（BE），忽略了延迟敏感类别中的细微差别，导致次优的用户体验和调度机会。

Method: PolyServe 首先根据每个请求的每令牌延迟需求将请求分组到多个容器中，然后将每个容器调度到服务器子集。通过路由请求到最高负载但仍可达成 SLO 的服务器来创建负载梯度，促进自动扩展。

Result: PolyServe 实现了 1.23 倍的良好吞吐增益，达到了最优良好吞吐的 92.5%。

Conclusion: PolyServe 提出了一种新颖的多 SLO 调度策略，能够在保持高 SLO 达成率的同时最大化吞吐量，相比现有策略实现了 1.23 倍的良好吞吐增益。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

Motivation: 评估不同QUBO求解器在解质量（能量）和计算时间方面的性能，以指导实际应用中的选择。

Method: 本研究对五种基于软件的QUBO求解器（Neal、PyTorch（CPU）、PyTorch（GPU）、JAX和SciPy）进行了基准测试，测试范围包括随机生成的1000x1000到45000x45000的QUBO矩阵，以及六种收敛阈值（10^-1到10^-6）。

Result: Neal实现了最低的能量值但仅限于6000个变量的问题；PyTorch在能量值上略高于Neal但展现了卓越的可扩展性（最多45000个变量），且支持GPU加速和多线程，显著缩短了运行时间；JAX的能量值略高于PyTorch，最多支持25000个变量，运行时间与PyTorch GPU版本相当；SciPy表现最差，最多支持6000个变量，能量值最高且计算时间最长。

Conclusion: PyTorch是最平衡的选择，适合大规模QUBO问题，尤其是在计算资源允许的情况下。

Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a versatile framework
for modeling combinatorial optimization problems. This study benchmarks five
software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and
SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to
45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate
their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time.
Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was
limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption.
PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated
superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support
for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly
shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and
was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU.
SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and
consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation
times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality,
scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most
balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources
permit.

Abstract: The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting
deep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of
modern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant
development is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most
expensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural
processing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of
traditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance
tradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system
integration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these
heterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system
integration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution
in these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware
integration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory
hierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally
verify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at
runtime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator
speedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V
Vector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within
a well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and
CPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image
pre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.
We demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable
a balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs
supporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than
traditional parallel execution platforms.

Conclusion: 智能缓存策略（如FIFO、LRU和基于优先级的缓存）显著降低了联邦学习的通信成本，同时保持了模型准确性，使其在边缘物联网网络中更具可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train
a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a
major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce

scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks,
making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other
latency-sensitive applications.

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at

Abstract: What if you could piece together your own custom biometrics and AI analysis
system, a bit like LEGO blocks? We aim to bring that technology to field
operators in the field who require flexible, high-performance edge AI system

including its modular scaling with multiple accelerators and the VDiSK
operating system for runtime reconfiguration, along with its cryptographic
capabilities to keep data stored on modules safe and private. Experiments
demonstrate near-linear throughput scaling from 1 to 5 neural compute

the USB3-based bus. Finally, we discuss applications of CHAMP in field
biometrics, surveillance, and disaster response, and outline future
improvements in bus protocols, cartridge capabilities, and system software.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PowerTrip系统动态选择高功率、低延迟的站点，优化分布式AI模型训练，提升效率50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模AI模型的计算和电力需求超过单个数据中心的容量，分布式训练成为必要，但带来了通信开销的挑战。现有方法忽视了站点间电力供应的异质性，PowerTrip旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PowerTrip采用动态贪心方法，基于功率-成本启发式选择站点，利用训练效率的边际增益来优化站点数量，平衡网络开销与计算能力增加的效益。

Result: 使用真实世界的Google电力轨迹进行评估，PowerTrip相比现有基线策略，将准确率提升时间缩短了高达50%。

Conclusion: PowerTrip通过动态选择高功率可用性和低网络延迟的站点，显著优化了大规模AI模型在电力受限、地理分布式环境中的训练效率，相比现有基线策略，将准确率提升时间缩短了高达50%。

Abstract: The exponential growth of large-scale AI models has led to computational and
power demands that can exceed the capacity of a single data center. This is due
to the limited power supplied by regional grids that leads to limited regional
computational power. Consequently, distributing training workloads across
geographically distributed sites has become essential. However, this approach
introduces a significant challenge in the form of communication overhead,
creating a fundamental trade-off between the performance gains from accessing
greater aggregate power and the performance losses from increased network
latency. Although prior work has focused on reducing communication volume or
using heuristics for distribution, these methods assume constant homogeneous
power supplies and ignore the challenge of heterogeneous power availability
between sites.
  To address the challenge of training large models in power-constrained,
geo-distributed environments, we introduce PowerTrip, a system that dynamically
selects a subset of sites during runtime to optimize the power-communication
trade-off. Specifically, PowerTrip selects sites based on a power-to-cost
heuristic, prioritizing those with high power availability and low network
latency. PowerTrip employs a dynamic greedy approach and uses the marginal gain
in training efficiency, i.e., accuracy improvement per unit of time, to
optimize for the number of sites where the performance penalty from network
overhead negates the benefit of adding more computational power. Our
evaluation, which uses real-world Google power traces to model realistic power
capacity constraints, demonstrates that PowerTrip can reduce time-to-accuracy
by up to 50% compared to existing baseline policies.

TL;DR: 论文提出C-Koordinator平台，通过CPI干扰预测和缓解策略，显著提升共置微服务集群的性能，降低延迟并稳定响应时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务共置虽提升了资源利用率，但引发了资源竞争和干扰问题，尤其在指标不可靠、应用多样性和节点异构性等挑战下更为突出。因此，设计干扰感知策略对提升资源利用率和缓解干扰至关重要。

Method: 论文首先分析了阿里巴巴大规模共置微服务集群的特性，讨论了为何采用CPI作为干扰度量标准，并通过多维指标实现CPI的准确预测。基于此，设计了C-Koordinator平台，集成了共置和干扰缓解策略。

Result: 干扰预测模型准确率超过90.3%，在实际操作环境中实现了干扰的精准预测和快速缓解。应用延迟在所有百分位数（P50、P90、P99）的响应时间上均得到改善，提升幅度达16.7%至36.1%。

Conclusion: 论文展示了C-Koordinator平台在阿里巴巴集群中的应用，通过CPI干扰预测和缓解策略，显著降低了应用延迟并稳定了响应时间，证明了其在共置环境中维持平滑应用性能的能力。

Abstract: Microservices transform traditional monolithic applications into lightweight,
loosely coupled application components and have been widely adopted in many
enterprises. Cloud platform infrastructure providers enhance the resource
utilization efficiency of microservices systems by co-locating different
microservices. However, this approach also introduces resource competition and
interference among microservices. Designing interference-aware strategies for
large-scale, co-located microservice clusters is crucial for enhancing resource
utilization and mitigating competition-induced interference. These challenges
are further exacerbated by unreliable metrics, application diversity, and node
heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of large-scale and
co-located microservices clusters at Alibaba and further discuss why cycle per
instruction (CPI) is adopted as a metric for interference measurement in
large-scale production clusters, as well as how to achieve accurate prediction
of CPI through multi-dimensional metrics. Based on CPI interference prediction
and analysis, we also present the design of the C-Koordinator platform, an
open-source solution utilized in Alibaba cluster, which incorporates
co-location and interference mitigation strategies. The interference prediction
models consistently achieve over 90.3% accuracy, enabling precise prediction
and rapid mitigation of interference in operational environments. As a result,
application latency is reduced and stabilized across all percentiles (P50, P90,
P99) response time (RT), achieving improvements ranging from 16.7% to 36.1%
under various system loads compared with state-of-the-art system. These results
demonstrate the system's ability to maintain smooth application performance in
co-located environments.

Method: 提出了CoCoServe弹性系统，采用模块级操作（如复制和迁移）和自动扩展机制来动态调节资源分配。

Result: CoCoServe可降低成本46%，延迟减少14%-75%，吞吐量平均提升1.16x-4x。

Conclusion: CoCoServe通过模块级操作和自动扩展机制，显著提升了LLM服务系统的资源利用率和性能，同时降低了成本。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new opportunities across
various fields but has also introduced significant challenges in resource
management. Current LLM serving systems face a fundamental tension: balancing
serving demands with limited resources while adapting to unpredictable traffic
patterns. Static deployments lead to suboptimal resource utilization and
performance degradation under dynamic workloads. Furthermore, the high cost of
adjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of
efficient LLM serving.
  To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates
dynamic and fine-grained scaling. Its key innovation lies in the module-level
operations for the replication and migration of LLM modules, such as decoder
layers and projections. Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs
associated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that
dynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance
optimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation
demonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit
excellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining
availability. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems (e.g., Hugging
Face Transformers and vLLM), our approach reduces latency by 14%-75% and
achieves 1.16x-4x throughput on average across different model sizes and
workloads.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing numerous industries, but
their substantial computational demands create challenges for efficient
deployment, particularly in cloud environments. Traditional approaches to
inference serving often struggle with resource inefficiencies, leading to high
operational costs, latency issues, and limited scalability. This article
explores how Cloud Native technologies, such as containerization,

serving. By leveraging these technologies, we demonstrate how a Cloud Native
system enables more efficient resource allocation, reduces latency, and
enhances throughput in high-demand scenarios. Through real-world evaluations
using Kubernetes-based autoscaling, we show that Cloud Native architectures can
dynamically adapt to workload fluctuations, mitigating performance bottlenecks
while optimizing LLM inference serving performance. This discussion provides a
broader perspective on how Cloud Native frameworks could reshape the future of
scalable LLM inference serving, offering key insights for researchers,
practitioners, and industry leaders in cloud computing and artificial

Motivation: 现有调度系统在快速变化的边缘环境中表现不佳，局部强化学习（RL）存在扩展性、知识整合和适应性问题。

Method: FCPO结合CRL和FRL，动态调整推理批次大小、输入分辨率和多线程处理。CRL捕捉环境动态变化，FRL通过跨模型经验整合提升泛化能力和收敛速度。

Result: 在真实EVA测试中，FCPO相比现有RL方法，吞吐量提升5倍以上，延迟降低60%，收敛速度加快20%，内存消耗减少10倍。

Conclusion: FCPO通过结合持续强化学习（CRL）和联邦强化学习（FRL），显著提升了边缘视频分析（EVA）系统的性能，包括吞吐量、延迟和收敛速度。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Edge Video Analytics (EVA) facilitates new kind of
intelligent applications, but creates challenges in real-time inference serving
systems. State-of-the-art (SOTA) scheduling systems optimize global workload
distributions for heterogeneous devices but often suffer from extended
scheduling cycles, leading to sub-optimal processing in rapidly changing Edge
environments. Local Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables quick adjustments
between cycles but faces scalability, knowledge integration, and adaptability
issues. Thus, we propose FCPO, which combines Continual RL (CRL) with Federated
RL (FRL) to address these challenges. This integration dynamically adjusts
inference batch sizes, input resolutions, and multi-threading during pre- and
post-processing. CRL allows agents to learn from changing Markov Decision
Processes, capturing dynamic environmental variations, while FRL improves
generalization and convergence speed by integrating experiences across
inference models. FCPO combines these via an agent-specific aggregation scheme
and a diversity-aware experience buffer. Experiments on a real-world EVA
testbed showed over 5 times improvement in effective throughput, 60% reduced
latency, and 20% faster convergence with up to 10 times less memory consumption
compared to SOTA RL-based approaches.

Motivation: 传统并行离散事件模拟引擎（如Warped2）在同步过程中存在低效的逻辑进程（LP）资源分配问题，且未解决复杂实体交互模式的挑战，这促使研究者提出一个优化的框架以提升性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Rising demand for complex simulations highlights conventional
engines'scalability limits, spurring Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES)
adoption.Warped2, a PDES engine leveraging Time Warp synchronization with
Pending Event Set optimization, delivers strong performance, it struggles with
inherent wargaming limitations: inefficient LP resource allocation during
synchronization and unaddressed complex entity interaction patterns. To address
these challenges, we present an optimized framework featuring four synergistic
improvements: (1) Asynchronous listener threads are introduced to address event
monitoring latency in large-scale scenarios, instead of synchronous polling
mechanisms, (2) METIS-based load rebalancing strategy is incorporated to
address the issue of dynamic event allocation during real-world simulation, (3)
Entity interaction solver with constraint satisfaction mechanisms is designed
to mitigate state conflicts, and (4) Spatial hashing algorithm to overcome
O(n^2) complexity bottlenecks in large-scale nearest-neighbor searches.
Experimental validation through a GridWorld demo demonstrates significant
enhancements in temporal fidelity and computational efficiency. Benchmark
results show our framework achieves 16x acceleration over baseline
implementations and maintains 8x speedup over 1-thread configuration across MPI
and Pthreads implementations.The combined load balancing and LP migration
strategy reduces synchronization overhead by 58.18%, with load balancing
accounting for 57% of the total improvement as the dominant optimization
factor. These improvements provide an enhanced solution for PDES implementation
in large-scale simulation scenarios.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的新型数据复制策略，旨在动态适应工作负载变化和不同架构，以在提供商利润和环境影响之间找到平衡，同时保证服务质量。

Abstract: The rapid growth of global data volumes has created a demand for scalable
distributed systems that can maintain a high quality of service. Data
replication is a widely used technique that provides fault tolerance, improved
performance and higher availability. Traditional implementations often rely on
threshold-based activation mechanisms, which can vary depending on workload
changes and system architecture. System administrators typically bear the
responsibility of adjusting these thresholds. To address this challenge,
reinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adapt to workload changes and
different architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel data replication
strategy for cloud systems that employs reinforcement learning to automatically
learn system characteristics and adapt to workload changes. The strategy's aim
is to provide satisfactory Quality of Service while optimizing a trade-off
between provider profit and environmental impact. We present the architecture
behind our solution and describe the reinforcement learning model by defining
the states, actions and rewards.

"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

TL;DR: I2I-STRADA是一种结构化推理代理架构，通过模拟分析推理的认知步骤，提升了数据分析任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统虽能自动化处理数据分析任务，但忽视了分析思维背后的结构化推理过程，导致推理步骤缺乏特定任务的固定流程。

Method: 提出了I2I-STRADA代理架构，通过模块化子任务模拟分析推理的认知步骤，包括目标解释、上下文知识基础、抽象计划构建和基于中间结果的执行调整。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中，I2I-STRADA在规划一致性和洞察对齐方面优于现有系统。

Conclusion: I2I-STRADA通过结构化推理流程显著提升了数据分析任务的规划一致性和洞察对齐，证明了在代理设计中融入结构化认知工作流的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Motivation: 现有的定性时间轴规划方法需要通过非确定性有限自动机进行转换，但非确定性自动机无法直接用于合成规划策略，因为需要昂贵的确定性步骤。

Method: 通过将计划存在性问题映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，避免了昂贵的确定性步骤。

Conclusion: 本文识别了一种定性时间轴规划的分片，其计划存在性问题可以直接映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，从而能够合成策略。此外，还识别了Allen关系的最大子集，适用于这种确定性分片。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出E.A.R.T.H.框架，通过错误驱动的生成方法显著提升AI创造力，实验证明该方法在多个指标上表现优异，并为创造性AI的发展提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI如何从模仿走向真正的创造力，提出“创造潜力隐藏在失败中”的观点，并通过认知科学和生成建模来验证这一假设。

Method: 论文提出了E.A.R.T.H.框架，一个五阶段的生成管道，包括错误生成、放大、精炼选择、转换和利用反馈。该方法结合了结构化提示、语义评分和人类在环评估，使用LLaMA-2-7B-Chat、SBERT、BERTScore、CLIP、BLIP-2和Stable Diffusion等技术，并基于新颖性、惊喜性和相关性的复合奖励函数。

Result: 在精炼阶段，创造力评分提高了52.5%（从1.179到1.898），最终输出达到2.010，提升了70.4%。生成的标语更短（缩短48.4%）、更新颖（增加40.7%），相关性仅下降4.0%。跨模态测试显示标语与图像的强对齐（CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816）。人类评估中，60%的输出得分≥4.0，隐喻性标语（平均4.09）优于字面性标语（3.99）。

Conclusion: 该论文通过E.A.R.T.H.框架展示了以错误为中心的生成方法如何显著提升AI的创造力，为自我进化、与人类对齐的创造性AI提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

Motivation: 探究图表和图形是否对AI系统分析数据有帮助。

Method: 进行了一系列实验，使用两种商业视觉语言模型（GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5）在三个代表性分析任务中测试了合成数据集的描述准确性。

Result: 当原始数据伴随散点图时，两种系统对合成数据集的描述更精确和准确，尤其在数据集复杂度增加时。与提供空白图表或数据不匹配图表的基线相比，性能提升源于图表内容。

Conclusion: AI系统与人类类似，可以从可视化中受益。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

Motivation: 由于部分可观测性和有限通信等实际限制，CTDE成为合作多智能体强化学习的主要范式，但现有方法未能充分利用中心化训练或缺乏理论保证。

Method: MAGPO通过集成中心化指导和去中心化执行，利用自回归联合策略进行可扩展的协调探索，并显式对齐去中心化策略以确保在部分可观测性下的可部署性。

Result: 在6个多样化环境的43个任务上，MAGPO持续优于强CTDE基线方法，并匹配或超越完全中心化方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO提供了一个有理论基础且实用的去中心化多智能体学习解决方案，其性能优于现有CTDE基线方法，并能媲美或超越完全中心化方法。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

Motivation: AI系统的能力呈指数级增长，但AI研究的速度受限于人类认知能力，形成发展瓶颈。ASI-Arch旨在通过自主研究打破这一限制。

Method: 提出了ASI-Arch系统，通过完全自主的神经架构发现，实现了从自动化优化到自动化创新的范式转变。系统能够自主假设、实现、训练并验证新架构。

Result: ASI-Arch 在20,000 GPU小时内完成了1,773次实验，发现了106种创新的线性注意力架构，其设计原则超越了人类设计的基线。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch 通过自主创新打破了人类认知能力的限制，实现了AI研究的自我加速，并建立了科学发现的可计算扩展规律。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域中的机器学习解决方案因预处理流程碎片化、模型兼容性问题及严格的数据隐私限制而成本高昂且劳动密集，亟需自动化解决方案来降低这些障碍。

Method: 提出了一个由多个模块化代理组成的AI框架，包括数据摄入识别、匿名化、特征提取、模型匹配、预处理推荐与实施以及模型推断等步骤，支持结构化和非结构化数据的自动化处理。

Conclusion: 该Agentic AI框架通过模块化、任务特定的代理自动化了临床数据处理的整个流程，显著降低了医疗环境中AI部署的成本和复杂性，为规模化应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Motivation: 由于临床试验和早期广泛实施中安全数据收集的时间窗口有限，亟需建立许可后监测系统。急诊分诊记录包含患者在进入医疗系统时的关键信息，可显著提升疫苗安全信号监测的及时性。

Method: 采用自然语言处理（NLP）技术和主动学习方法，结合数据增强和评估技术，开发分类器。

Conclusion: 本研究结合主动学习、数据增强和评估技术，开发了一个用于从急诊分诊记录中检测潜在疫苗安全问题的分类器，从而提升了疫苗安全监测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

Motivation: 探讨均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，并与其他聚合函数（如求和和最大）进行比较，以理解其在图神经网络中的表现。

Method: 通过比较均值聚合GNNs与比率模态逻辑的表达能力，以及在均匀设置下与MSO的比较，分析了不同聚合函数的表达能力。

Result: 在非均匀设置下，均值GNNs的表达能力与比率模态逻辑相同；在均匀设置下，其表达能力低于求和和最大GNNs。

Conclusion: 在非均匀设置下，使用均值聚合的图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力与比率模态逻辑相同，高于使用最大聚合的GNNs，但低于使用求和聚合的GNNs。在均匀设置下，相较于MSO，均值GNNs的表达能力严格低于求和和最大GNNs。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种框架，通过分解LLMs的知识和推理能力，揭示了参数扩展对两者的影响及各自在网络中的分布，为模型理解和开发提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理过程中同时利用知识和推理能力，区分二者对模型分析、可解释性和开发至关重要。

Method: 受双系统认知理论启发，作者提出了一种认知归因框架，将LLMs的认知分解为两个互补阶段：知识检索（阶段1）和推理调整（阶段2）。通过让LLMs在快速思维和慢速思维两种认知模式下生成答案，分析不同模式下的表现以量化知识和推理的贡献。

Result: 研究结果显示：（1）推理调整具有领域特异性，对推理密集型领域（如数学、物理和化学）有益，但可能损害知识密集型领域。（2）参数扩展同时提升知识和推理能力，其中知识提升更显著；此外，参数扩展使LLMs的推理更谨慎，同时略微提升智能。（3）知识主要存在于网络较低层，而推理则在高层次进行。

Conclusion: 该论文的框架不仅从“解耦”角度帮助理解大型语言模型（LLMs），还为现有研究（如扩展法则、分层知识编辑和小模型推理的局限性）提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Motivation: 探讨在 Answer Set Programming 中，不遵循模型最小性原则的析取语义，以理解不同方法的异同及其关系。

Method: 比较了四种不同的析取语义，其中两种直接提供非最小语义的替代方案，另外两种引入了新的析取连接词，但在此作为标准析取操作符的新语义进行比较。

Result: 证明了三种方法实际上一致，并比较了其与第四种方法的关系，共同语义提供了稳定模型的超集，且强于第四种方法。

Conclusion: 本文证明了三种方法（Forks、Justified Models 和 DI 语义的合理放宽）实际上是一致的，构成了一个在不同定义下的共同方法。此外，这种共同语义总是提供程序稳定模型的超集（实际上，在任何上下文中），并且严格强于第四种方法（Strongly Supported Models），后者实际上将析取视为经典逻辑。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动化评估物理考试中学生答案正确性的挑战性问题。

Method: 采用计算机代数系统、SMT求解器和项重写系统，结合大规模语言模型处理学生答案，并通过自动化推理技术评估答案正确性。

Result: 在2023年澳大利亚物理奥林匹克竞赛的1500多份真实学生考试答案上进行了评估，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合计算机代数系统、SMT求解器和项重写系统的自动化物理考试评分方法，并通过大规模语言模型处理学生答案，最终在真实考试数据上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的LLM推理方法多为启发式和直觉驱动，缺乏理论支持，限制了方法论的系统发展。

Method: 提出了一种基于信息瓶颈（IB）原则的理论框架IBRO，并推导出实用的token级代理目标和高效近似方法，即轻量级IB正则化方法。该方法可无缝集成到现有基于强化学习的后训练框架中。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准和强化学习算法上验证了IB正则化的有效性，证明了其在提升LLM推理性能方面的持续改进。

Conclusion: 本研究通过信息瓶颈（IB）原则提出了IB-aware推理优化（IBRO）框架，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的推理性能，且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过强化学习优化呼叫中心的路由策略，以减少客户等待时间和员工闲置时间。

Method: 比较了两种方法：基于模型的Value Iteration（VI）和模型无关的Proximal Policy Optimisation（PPO）。前者使用理论模型，后者结合了离散事件模拟（DES）和OpenAI Gym环境。

Result: 经过1,000次测试，PPO策略在奖励、客户等待时间和员工闲置时间方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: PPO方法在优化呼叫中心路由方面表现最佳，尽管需要更长的训练时间，但能显著减少客户等待时间和员工闲置时间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Conclusion: 本研究通过利用现代GPU的大规模计算能力，成功提升了Compact-Table（CT）算法的处理效率，使其能够有效处理大规模的Table约束问题。实验验证表明，GPU加速的CT算法在现有约束求解器中的集成表现优异。

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Motivation: 独立设计和训练的深度神经网络编码器潜在空间不匹配会导致语义信道噪声，影响接收方对传输表示的理解，降低系统性能。

Method: 提出PFE方法，无需系统重新训练即可对齐异构编码器的潜在空间，支持动态信号压缩与扩展，并引入动态优化策略协调通信、计算和学习资源。

Result: 大量仿真证实PFE在多样化和时变网络条件下能有效保持语义一致性，满足延迟和准确性的长期约束。

Conclusion: 在未来的AI原生无线网络中，Parseval Frame Equalizer (PFE) 通过零样本、基于帧的语义信道均衡器有效解决了异构编码器潜在空间不匹配问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: In future AI-native wireless networks, the presence of mismatches between the
latent spaces of independently designed and trained deep neural network (DNN)
encoders may impede mutual understanding due to the emergence of semantic
channel noise. This undermines the receiver's ability to interpret transmitted
representations, thereby reducing overall system performance. To address this
issue, we propose the Parseval Frame Equalizer (PFE), a zero-shot, frame-based
semantic channel equalizer that aligns latent spaces of heterogeneous encoders
without requiring system retraining. PFE enables dynamic signal compression and
expansion, mitigating semantic noise while preserving performance on downstream
tasks. Building on this capability, we introduce a dynamic optimization
strategy that coordinates communication, computation, and learning resources to
balance energy consumption, end-to-end (E2E) latency, and task performance in
multi-agent semantic communication scenarios. Extensive simulations confirm the
effectiveness of our approach in maintaining semantic consistency and meeting
long-term constraints on latency and accuracy under diverse and time-varying
network conditions.

Motivation: 解决LPWAN中大规模传感器数据高效、低延迟传输的挑战，以满足新兴IoT和CPS应用的需求。

Method: 利用分布式正交频分复用（D-OFDM）子载波和Gold码的PN序列集，实现异步传感器数据的并行接收和解码。

Result: 实验结果表明，SNOW技术可实现约9倍的扩展性提升，同时保持数据收集的及时性和传感器的能效。

Conclusion: 通过开发基于Gold码的伪随机噪声（PN）序列集，实现了SNOW技术的大规模扩展性，使得基站能够同时解码同一子载波上多个异步传感器的数据，同时支持并行处理其他子载波的数据。

Abstract: LPWANs have become ubiquitous due to their ability to connect sensors over
large geographic areas in a single hop. It is, however, very challenging to
achieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data
efficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may
require. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly
advancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel
reception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a
different subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by
enabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on
the same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.
Additionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data
from the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data
parallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold
code-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering
within and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the
set for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive
concurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve
approximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection
at the BS and energy efficient at the sensors. This may enable emerging IoT and
CPS applications requiring tens of thousands of sensors with longer battery
life and making data-driven, time-sensitive decisions.

Motivation: 车辆在相邻车道行驶时速度不同，导致RSU驻留时间和通信时长差异，引发网络资源访问不公平，可能影响驾驶安全。同时，Mode 2引入的抢占机制要求同时优化公平访问和AoI。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种联合优化框架，通过自适应调整SPS的选择窗口，有效平衡了公平访问和最小化AoI，仿真结果验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the fair access problem and the Age of Information
(AoI) under 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Mode 2 in
vehicular networks. Specifically, vehicles follow Mode 2 to communicate with
Roadside Units (RSUs) to obtain accurate data for driving
assistance.Nevertheless, vehicles often have different velocity when they are
moving in adjacent lanes, leading to difference in RSU dwelltime and
communication duration. This results in unfair access to network resources,
potentially influencing driving safety. To ensure the freshness of received
data, the AoI should be analyzed. Mode 2 introduces a novel preemption
mechanism, necessitating simultaneous optimization of fair access and AoI to
guarantee timely and relevant data delivery. We propose a joint optimization
framework for vehicular network, defining a fairness index and employing
Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) to model AoI under preemption mechanism. By
adaptively adjusting the selection window of Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS)
in Mode 2, we address the optimization of fairness and AoI. We apply a large
language model (LLM)-Based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on
Decomposition (MOEA/D) to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our scheme in balancing fair access and minimizing AoI.

Abstract: IEEE 802.11 networks continuously adapt to meet the stringent requirements of
emerging applications like cloud gaming, eXtended Reality (XR), and video

reliability. To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (Co-SR) can
potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This
mechanism is expected to enable simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting
spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network
performance. In this paper, we shed light on the performance of Co-SR for Wi-Fi
8 networks. For that, we propose an implementation of Co-SR aligned with
ongoing Wi-Fi 8 standardization efforts. The evaluation is done on a Wi-Fi
simulator, which allows us to study the performance of the proposed Co-SR
mechanisms in relevant scenarios. The results obtained in a Wireless Local Area
Network (WLAN) consisting of four APs show delay reduction with Co-SR ranging
from 31% to 95% when compared to Distributed Coordination Function (DCF).

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software
Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support.
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an
exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers
engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to
trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This
paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process
model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design,
inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that
could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output
quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学报告中缺乏标准化和透明度导致的再现性危机。

Method: 对11种自动化工具在9种严谨性标准上进行了广泛比较。

Result: 发现某些标准下特定工具表现最佳，而在其他标准下多个工具组合表现优于单一工具。

Conclusion: 研究总结了一系列关于提高科学报告严谨性和透明度的自动化工具的见解和建议，并提供了代码和数据供进一步研究。

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data
for the study is available at https://github.com/PeterEckmann1/tool-comparison.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有研究探讨了AI在游戏中的传统应用，但缺乏对GenAI在开源社区中实际应用的理解。本研究旨在填补这一空白，探索GenAI在开源游戏开发中的讨论、采纳和集成情况。

Method: 研究构建了一个包含AI相关议题的开源游戏仓库数据集，采用开放式卡片分类和主题分析对GitHub议题进行分层抽样和标注，以比较GenAI、传统AI及非AI议题的差异。

Conclusion: 该研究通过对GitHub上开源游戏开发中GenAI相关议题的分析，揭示了GenAI与传统AI在工具、任务和挑战方面的差异，为理解GenAI在实际开发中的应用提供了实证依据。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how
games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation,
gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored
traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating
procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is
adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source
community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed,
adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue
discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges
associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving
traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI
differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns,
and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of
open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open
card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues,
labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative
analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how
GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了影响计算教育者采用项目式学习的因素，发现尽管PjBL受重视，但采用仍受规划、项目设计和制度支持不足的挑战。系统性支持对扩展PjBL至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 项目式学习作为一种以学生为中心的教学方法，能提升学生的动机、参与度、批判性思维、协作和问题解决能力。然而，由于制度支持不足、时间限制、培训机会有限等挑战，教师的采用仍不一致。

Method: 采用混合方法，通过在线调查收集了80名计算教育者的数据，包括封闭式问题以量化障碍、推动因素和资源需求，以及开放式问题以获取定性见解。定量数据使用统计方法分析，定性回答则进行主题分析。

Result: 结果显示，教师在有同行协作、专业发展和制度激励的情况下更可能采用或持续PjBL。此外，从研究、行业合作和同行借鉴中获取项目是新项目的关键推动因素。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管项目式学习（PjBL）受到广泛重视，但其采用仍受到规划和管理学习过程、设计合适项目以及缺乏制度支持等挑战的影响。系统性的支持结构对于赋能教师尝试和扩展PjBL实践至关重要。

Abstract: This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GitHub Actions提供了官方文档和社区支持的最佳实践，但缺乏对开源项目中真实CI工作流如何遵循这些实践的实证理解。

Method: 使用来自Java、Python和C++仓库的大型GHA工作流数据集，分析工作流的结构、复杂性、异质性和合规性。

Result: 研究发现将展示最佳实践的强遵循领域和需要改进的领域，并揭示不同编程语言在CI管道设计上的差异。

Conclusion: 研究预计将揭示开源项目中GitHub Actions工作流的最佳实践遵循情况以及需要改进的领域，为CI服务提供更清晰的指南和示例。

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) has evolved from a tooling strategy to a
fundamental mindset in modern CI engineering. It enables teams to develop,
test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,
GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep
integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.
Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best
practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how
open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows
might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI
practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,
heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software
repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++
repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze
recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with
GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across
programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong
adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These
insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight
the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标识符名称是有效程序理解的基础，但研究表明，选择不当的名称会显著增加认知负担并阻碍协作。即使单独看起来可读的名称，在上下文中与其他名称在结构或功能上相似时也可能导致误解。

Method: 开发了一个分类法，用于分类不同形式的标识符名称相似性。

Result: 提出了一个初步的分类法，用于识别和分类软件项目中的标识符名称相似性。

Conclusion: 初步的分类法为研究者提供了一个平台，用于分析和评估标识符名称相似性对代码理解、可维护性和开发者协作的影响，并允许进一步细化和扩展分类法。

Abstract: Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are
the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown
that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder
collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to
misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either
structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our
preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in
software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes
different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy
providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of
identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and
collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and
expansion of the taxonomy.

TL;DR: 论文填补了LLM供应链安全研究的空白，首次引入了一个全面的数据集，揭示了深度依赖和广泛漏洞，并提出了安全建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的系统在多个领域的广泛应用，理解其复杂供应链中的风险变得尤为重要。目前大多数风险评估仅关注模型或数据层面，忽视了更广泛的供应链漏洞。

Method: 通过收集3,859个真实世界的LLM应用，进行相互依赖性分析，识别了109,211个模型、2,474个数据集和9,862个库，并提取了模型微调路径、数据集重用和库依赖关系，绘制了生态系统的结构。

Result: 研究发现LLM应用中存在深度嵌套的依赖关系，整个供应链中存在显著的安全漏洞，强调了进行全面安全分析的必要性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了针对LLM供应链安全的实用建议，旨在引导研究者和开发者构建更安全、更可信的LLM系统。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment
of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate,
understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is
increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on
interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party
libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly
focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.
While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there
remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.
  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for
analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859
real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying
109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model
fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's
structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for
applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from
public vulnerability databases.
  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.
Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and
significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for
comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to
guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled
systems.

TL;DR: NoCode-bench基准评估LLMs在自然语言驱动开发中的表现，结果显示当前LLMs能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言驱动无代码开发中的潜力，以提升生产力和普及开发。

Method: 引入了NoCode-bench基准，包含634个任务和114k代码变更，用于评估LLMs在现实世界NL驱动功能添加任务中的表现。

Result: 最佳LLMs的任务成功率仅为15.79%，显示在跨文件编辑、代码库理解和工具调用方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs目前尚未准备好完全支持自然语言驱动的无代码开发，NoCode-bench为未来在这一领域的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software
functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code,
promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language
models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context,
software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work
introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world
NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects
and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding
code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of
114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures
reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the
best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges
in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings
indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development.
NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.

Conclusion: SMECS通过简化元数据创建过程，支持研究软件的FAIR化，并通过可用性实验证实了其良好的用户体验。

Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in adopting the FAIR principles for research
software and enables findability and reusability. However, creating
high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research
software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software
Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the
extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly
interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online
repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an
interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The
usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed
that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the
FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

Motivation: EAIR系统bug的普遍性和特殊性缺乏深入理解，阻碍了相关技术和实践的发展。

Method: 通过分析80个EAIR系统项目中的885个bug，进行分类研究。

Result: 识别了8种EAIR特有症状和8种特有原因，构建了原因与模块的映射关系。

Conclusion: 本研究为EAIR系统bug的首个系统性研究，揭示了18种根本原因、15种症状及13个受影响模块，为未来研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly
evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is
fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth
understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the
development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR
system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their
symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes
considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15
distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new
interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research
on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified
symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is
characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.
Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the
majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and
decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,
detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and
the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to
focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

TL;DR: Scheduzz是一种基于LLM的库模糊测试技术，通过双调度框架优化驱动生成和执行，显著提高效率并发现多个漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动生成模糊驱动的技术因缺乏对库使用规范的遵循，导致生成不合理驱动，浪费计算资源且效果不佳。

Method: 利用LLM理解库的合理使用方式并提取API组合约束，设计双调度框架优化生成和执行模糊驱动。

Result: 在33个库中，Scheduzz显著减少计算开销，在16/21个库中优于UTopia，覆盖率分别比CKGFuzzer、Promptfuzz和OSS-Fuzz高1.62倍、1.50倍和1.89倍，发现33个未知漏洞（3个CVE）。

Conclusion: Scheduzz通过LLM理解库的合理使用方式，并提取API组合约束，结合双调度框架显著提高了模糊测试的效率和效果，在33个真实库中发现33个未知漏洞，其中3个获得CVE编号。

Abstract: Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and
craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many
techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,
they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to
proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after
being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques
unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers
that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and
generating false positive bug reports.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing
technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs
to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination
constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling
framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz
drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing
campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,
multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while
simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or
suspension.
  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared
to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead
and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and
1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer,
Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition,
Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries,
3 of which have been assigned CVEs.

TL;DR: YATE 通过静态分析和重新提示修复语言模型生成的错误测试，显著提升了测试覆盖率和突变杀死率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成的测试虽然在语法和语义上常有错误，但这些错误测试如果被修复，往往能直接增加测试价值并间接成为生成更多测试的良好种子。

Method: YATE 结合了基于规则的静态分析和重新提示技术来修复由语言模型生成的不正确测试。

Result: YATE 在6个开源项目上的评估显示，其平均能覆盖32.06%更多的代码行，杀死21.77%更多的突变体，且在线覆盖率、分支覆盖率和突变杀死率上均优于其他四种LLM方法。

Conclusion: YATE 是一种通过结合基于规则的静态分析和重新提示来修复不正确测试的简单技术，其在提升测试覆盖率和突变杀死率方面表现优于其他基于LLM的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to
produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many
incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such
incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed
opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing
value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and
indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we
propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through
a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this
simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that
it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and
kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE
with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and
COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code.
YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20%
more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，针对特定类型问题设计的启发式方法在通用问题上表现不佳，强调了开发通用模型的必要性。同时，不同问题类型之间存在微小但显著的性能差异，且项目依赖性较强，鼓励开发适应项目特定特征的方法。

Abstract: Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files
requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to
develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are
starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing
research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other
selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part
of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without
any specific selection.
  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file
localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging
practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file
localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.
Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases
known in the bug localisation community on our dataset.
  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform
poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general
purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically
significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally,
we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for
most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the
development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将SystemC虚拟平台与FMI标准集成的新框架，通过案例研究展示了其有效性，能够在不修改目标软件的情况下接收外部工具的真实环境数据，加速测试和认证过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着系统复杂度的增加，对全面测试和虚拟原型的需求也在增长。然而，SystemC缺乏原生FMI支持，限制了其在更广泛的协同模拟环境中的集成。

Method: 该研究提出了一个控制SystemC虚拟平台并与FMI集成的框架，通过一个案例研究展示了如何在SystemC模拟中通过FMI从外部工具获取温度值，模拟温度传感器。

Result: 该框架成功实现了SystemC虚拟平台与FMI的集成，使目标软件能够在虚拟平台上运行并接收来自外部工具的真实环境输入数据，从而支持广泛的软件测试和验证。

Conclusion: 通过提出一个新颖的框架，将SystemC虚拟平台与FMI标准集成，该研究使得无需修改目标软件即可在虚拟平台上运行，并接收来自外部工具的真实环境输入数据，从而加速软件测试和验证过程，并提前完成如ISO 26262等认证。

Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual
prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed
to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the
environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software
from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software
without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the
so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized
framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and
concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks
native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation
environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with
SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a
simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature
values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified
target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data
such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,
extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready
and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,
certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动代码审查主观性强且耗时，而现有LLM缺乏逻辑推理能力，无法完全理解和评估代码。

Method: 本研究提出了一种混合方法，将符号推理技术与LLM（如CodeT5、CodeBERT和GraphCodeBERT）结合，并在CodexGlue数据集上进行了测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在自动化代码审查中表现出更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 结合符号推理技术与大型语言模型（LLM）的混合方法显著提升了自动化代码审查的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了RAG方法在闭源代码库中的有效性，发现基于相似性的RAG结合词法和语义检索技术表现最佳，并通过开发者调查验证了其实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注公开代码库，而开源与闭源代码库之间的潜在分布差异尚未探索，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 对26个开源LLM（参数规模0.5B至671B）进行了广泛的实证研究，探索了基于标识符和基于相似性的两种RAG方法，并采用了词法（如BM25）和语义（如GTE-Qwen）检索技术。

Result: 基于1,669个内部代码库的实验表明：(1) 两种RAG方法均有效，基于相似性的RAG表现更优；(2) 更先进的检索技术（如BM25和GTE-Qwen）能提升性能；(3) 词法和语义检索技术结合可互补优势。此外，开发者调查验证了RAG在实际开发环境中的实用性。

Conclusion: 检索增强生成（RAG）方法在闭源代码库中表现出有效性，其中基于相似性的RAG性能更优，且结合词法和语义检索技术能实现最佳效果。

Abstract: Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances
developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to
enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant
context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and
benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and
closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To
mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance
of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase
of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we
extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG
and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B
parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval
techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.
Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both
RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with
similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of
similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where
BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior
performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.
Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of
RAG methods in real-world development environments.

Abstract: Designing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that enables a mobile robot
to safely navigate through an obstacle-filled environment is a complicated yet
essential task in robotics. In this technical report, safety refers to ensuring
that the robot respects state and input constraints while avoiding collisions
with obstacles despite the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This
report offers a step-by-step approach to implementing Nonlinear Model
Predictive Control (NMPC) schemes addressing these safety requirements.
Numerous books and survey papers provide comprehensive overviews of linear MPC
(LMPC) \cite{bemporad2007robust,kouvaritakis2016model}, NMPC
\cite{rawlings2017model,allgower2004nonlinear,mayne2014model,grune2017nonlinear,saltik2018outlook},
and their applications in various domains, including robotics
\cite{nascimento2018nonholonomic,nguyen2021model,shi2021advanced,wei2022mpc}.
This report does not aim to replicate those exhaustive reviews. Instead, it
focuses specifically on NMPC as a foundation for safe mobile robot navigation.
The goal is to provide a practical and accessible path from theoretical
concepts to mathematical proofs and implementation, emphasizing safety and
performance guarantees. It is intended for researchers, robotics engineers, and
practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical NMPC formulations
and real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach
for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance
estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative
measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We
integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in
order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates
with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least
squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the
proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,
noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position
measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation
problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized
simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic
joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we
also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful
degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth
requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that combines the advantages of both
model-based and learning-based frameworks to achieve robust locomotion. The
residual modules are integrated with each corresponding part of the model-based
framework, a footstep planner and dynamic model designed using heuristics, to
complement performance degradation caused by a model mismatch. By utilizing a
modular structure and selecting the appropriate learning-based method for each
residual module, our framework demonstrates improved control performance in
environments with high uncertainty, while also achieving higher learning
efficiency compared to baseline methods. Moreover, we observed that our
proposed methodology not only enhances control performance but also provides
additional benefits, such as making nominal controllers more robust to
parameter tuning. To investigate the feasibility of our framework, we
demonstrated residual modules combined with model predictive control in a real
quadrupedal robot. Despite uncertainties beyond the simulation, the robot
successfully maintains balance and tracks the commanded velocity.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a subsystem, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),
for search and rescue missions, focusing on people detection, face recognition
and tracking of identified individuals. The proposed solution integrates a UAV
with ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are
performed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the
YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN
for face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face
recognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV
operator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and
immediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on
specific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN
model. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a
safe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is
performed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system
parameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to
estimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual.
The initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that
the proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time. The next step
involves implementing the system on a large experimental UAV for field use and
integrating autonomous navigation with GPS-guided control for rescue operations
planning.

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN是一种轻量级方法，可在边缘设备上实现，适用于典型的移动机器人应用，显著提高了导航精度。

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了MediaPipe算法在手术照明条件下对面部标志点检测的改进准确性，尤其是在较大的偏航和俯仰角度下表现更佳，为将其整合到医疗程序中提供了可能。

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

Conclusion: ReSem3D 在语义丰富的家庭环境和稀疏的化学实验室环境中表现出色，能够零样本条件下执行多样化操作任务，展示了强大的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AdaRPG uses foundation models to improve manipulation of diverse articulated objects by focusing on part-level affordances, showing strong generalization in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The geometric diversity and functional variations of articulated objects complicate visual perception and hinder unified adaptive manipulation strategies.

Method: AdaRPG leverages foundation models to extract object parts with local geometric similarity, trains an affordance model using a part-level annotation dataset, and reasons about complex mechanisms to generate high-level control codes.

Result: AdaRPG effectively enhances visual affordance generalization and generates successful manipulation trajectories.

Conclusion: AdaRPG demonstrates strong generalization ability across novel articulated object categories, validated through simulation and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

Abstract: In robotic navigation, maintaining precise pose estimation and navigation in
complex and dynamic environments is crucial. However, environmental challenges
such as smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather can significantly degrade the
performance of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS, compromising the
overall stability and safety of autonomous robots. To address these challenges,
we propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D
millimeter-wave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to
leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry
estimation in complex environments. Our method consists of three key modules.
Firstly, the pre-processing module utilizes radar data to assist LiDAR in
removing dynamic points and determining when environmental conditions are
degraded for LiDAR. Secondly, the dynamic-aware multimodal odometry selects
appropriate point cloud data for scan-to-map matching and tightly couples it
with the IMU using the Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. Lastly, the factor
graph optimization module balances weights between odometry and GPS data,
constructing a pose graph for optimization. The proposed approach has been
evaluated on datasets and tested in real-world robotic environments,
demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over existing methods in
challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels.

Conclusion: G2S-ICP SLAM 在定位精度和重建完整性方面优于现有SLAM系统，同时保持了渲染质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel geometry-aware RGB-D Gaussian Splatting
SLAM system, named G2S-ICP SLAM. The proposed method performs high-fidelity 3D
reconstruction and robust camera pose tracking in real-time by representing
each scene element using a Gaussian distribution constrained to the local
tangent plane. This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk
aligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth
interpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D
ellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this
representation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian
disks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance
prior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we
propose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal
consistency. Our system achieves real-time operation while preserving both
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Replica and
TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate that G2S-ICP SLAM outperforms prior SLAM systems
in terms of localization accuracy, reconstruction completeness, while
maintaining the rendering quality.

TL;DR: 提出RKMPC框架，结合LMPC和神经网络补偿，显著提升车辆轨迹跟踪性能，实验验证其高效性和优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统车辆建模在非线性动态捕捉和计算效率之间的固有权衡问题，提升控制性能。

Method: 采用双线性MPC架构：LMPC基于车辆运动学模型计算基线控制输入，神经网络基础的RKMPC计算补偿输入，两者相加得到最终控制命令。

Result: 实验表明，RKMPC仅需传统KMPC 20%的训练数据，同时横向误差降低11.7%-22.1%，航向误差减少8.9%-15.8%，前轮转向稳定性提升高达27.6%。

Conclusion: RKMPC框架在保持传统机理模型可靠性和可解释性的同时，通过残差建模实现了性能优化，显著提升了跟踪性能和控制稳定性。

Abstract: In vehicle trajectory tracking tasks, the simplest approach is the Pure
Pursuit (PP) Control. However, this single-point preview tracking strategy
fails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control
actions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its
control performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.
Traditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between
capturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often
resulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.
This method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a
Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input
based on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC
calculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by
adding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and
interpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance
optimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the
Carsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH
racing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the
training data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC)
while delivering superior tracking performance. Compared to traditional LMPC,
RKMPC reduces lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, decreases heading error by
8.9%-15.8%, and improves front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%. The
implementation code is available at: https://github.com/ZJU-DDRX/Residual

Motivation: 医疗应用中，服装通常以折叠状态存储，需要额外的展开步骤。现有研究假设服装已展开，因此论文提出预穿衣步骤，以解决这一实际问题。

Method: 论文采用模仿学习来学习三种操作原语（包括高低加速度动作），并利用视觉分类器对服装状态进行分类。

Result: 实验结果表明，高动态动作对新拆封服装的展开效果不佳，而动作组合能有效提升展开效率。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是，结合高低加速度动作的组合策略可以有效地展开新拆封的医疗服装，而单一的高动态动作效果较差。

Abstract: Robotic-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly aid both
patients as well as healthcare personnel, reducing the workload and improving
the efficiency in clinical settings. While substantial progress has been made
in robotic dressing assistance, prior works typically assume that garments are
already unfolded and ready for use. However, in medical applications gowns and
aprons are often stored in a folded configuration, requiring an additional
unfolding step. In this paper, we introduce the pre-dressing step, the process
of unfolding garments prior to assisted dressing. We leverage imitation
learning for learning three manipulation primitives, including both high and
low acceleration motions. In addition, we employ a visual classifier to
categorise the garment state as closed, partly opened, and fully opened. We
conduct an empirical evaluation of the learned manipulation primitives as well
as their combinations. Our results show that highly dynamic motions are not
effective for unfolding freshly unpacked garments, where the combination of
motions can efficiently enhance the opening configuration.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于压缩感知（CS）和蒙特卡洛优化的机器人采样轨迹设计方法，显著减少了机器人行进距离并提高了信号重建精度。

Abstract: In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has gained significant interest as a
technique for acquiring high-resolution sensory data using fewer measurements
than traditional Nyquist sampling requires. At the same time, autonomous
robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular
tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including
measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,
this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into
how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design
optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We
propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement
matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the
signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is
the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying
transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the
number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution
maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce
robot travel distance to less than $10\%$ of a full-coverage path, while
improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to
traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by
a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)
methods.

Conclusion: 论文通过实验比较了两种全身控制方法（ID-WBC和PB-WBC）的性能，并分析了它们在不同条件下的优缺点，为实际应用提供了参考。

Abstract: This paper studies the experimental comparison of two different whole-body
control formulations for humanoid robots: inverse dynamics whole-body control
(ID-WBC) and passivity-based whole-body control (PB-WBC). The two controllers
fundamentally differ from each other as the first is formulated in task
acceleration space and the latter is in task force space with passivity
considerations. Even though both control methods predict stability under ideal
conditions in closed-loop dynamics, their robustness against joint friction,
sensor noise, unmodeled external disturbances, and non-perfect contact
conditions is not evident. Therefore, we analyze and experimentally compare the
two controllers on a humanoid robot platform through swing foot position and
orientation control, squatting with and without unmodeled additional weights,
and jumping. We also relate the observed performance and characteristic
differences with the controller formulations and highlight each controller's
advantages and disadvantages.

Motivation: 研究在平滑分析框架下，三个经典在线问题的竞争比表现，以填补最坏情况和平均情况之间的空白。

Method: 通过将平滑实例简化为有限度量空间上的完全对抗性实例，并黑盒利用现有算法。

Result: 在度量空间包含于任何赋范空间的球中且请求分布密度函数上限为$1/\sigma$倍均匀密度的条件下，三个问题均存在polylog$(k/\sigma)$竞争比的算法。

Conclusion: 论文展示了在平滑分析框架下，$k$-server、$k$-taxi和追逐大小为$k$的集合三个经典在线问题可以设计出具有polylog$(k/\sigma)$竞争比的算法，且这一结果在竞争比的下界上达到最优（与polylogarithm的指数匹配）。

Abstract: We study three classical online problems -- $k$-server, $k$-taxi, and chasing
size $k$ sets -- through a lens of smoothed analysis. Our setting allows
request locations to be adversarial up to small perturbations, interpolating
between worst-case and average-case models. Specifically, we show that if the
metric space is contained in a ball in any normed space and requests are drawn
from distributions whose density functions are upper bounded by $1/\sigma$
times the uniform density over the ball, then all three problems admit
polylog$(k/\sigma)$-competitive algorithms. Our approach is simple: it reduces
smoothed instances to fully adversarial instances on finite metrics and
leverages existing algorithms in a black-box manner. We also provide a lower
bound showing that no algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio
sub-polylogarithmic in $k/\sigma$, matching our upper bounds up to the exponent
of the polylogarithm. In contrast, the best known competitive ratios for these
problems in the fully adversarial setting are $2k-1$, $\infty$ and
$\Theta(k^2)$, respectively.

Motivation: 解决半流模型中近似单源最短路径问题的传递复杂度长期存在的开放性问题。

Method: 提出了一种简单的随机算法，能够在O(1/ε * n log³n)空间和O(1/ε * (log n / log log n)²)传递次数内计算(1+ε)-近似最短路径，并证明了任何常数近似算法需要Ω(log n / log log n)传递次数的下界。

Result: 算法在空间和传递次数上均有显著改进，下界证明填补了先前仅针对小近似比和常数传递次数的空白。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出一种随机算法并证明其下界，显著缩小了半流模型中近似单源最短路径问题的传递复杂度差距。

Abstract: In the semi-streaming model, an algorithm must process any $n$-vertex graph
by making one or few passes over a stream of its edges, use $O(n \cdot
\text{polylog }n)$ words of space, and at the end of the last pass, output a
solution to the problem at hand. Approximating (single-source) shortest paths
on undirected graphs is a longstanding open question in this model. In this
work, we make progress on this question from both upper and lower bound fronts:
  We present a simple randomized algorithm that for any $\epsilon > 0$, with
high probability computes $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths from a
given source vertex in \[
  O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \cdot n \log^3 n \right)~\text{space} \quad
\text{and} \quad O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \cdot \left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log
n} \right) ^2\right) ~\text{passes}.
  \] The algorithm can also be derandomized and made to work on dynamic streams
at a cost of some extra $\text{poly}(\log n, 1/\epsilon)$ factors only in the
space. Previously, the best known algorithms for this problem required
$1/\epsilon \cdot \log^{c}(n)$ passes, for an unspecified large constant $c$.
  We prove that any semi-streaming algorithm that with large constant
probability outputs any constant approximation to shortest paths from a given
source vertex (even to a single fixed target vertex and only the distance, not
necessarily the path) requires \[ \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)
~\text{passes}. \] We emphasize that our lower bound holds for any
constant-factor approximation of shortest paths. Previously, only constant-pass
lower bounds were known and only for small approximation ratios below two.
  Our results collectively reduce the gap in the pass complexity of
approximating single-source shortest paths in the semi-streaming model from
$\text{polylog } n$ vs $\omega(1)$ to only a quadratic gap.

Result: 提出了强稀疏化算法，并证明了其在1-in-3-SAT中的有效性，同时改进了3-uniform超图线性有序着色的近似算法。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种称为强稀疏化的新概念，并展示了其在1-in-3-SAT问题中的应用，同时改进了3-uniform超图线性有序着色的近似算法。

Abstract: We introduce a new notion of sparsification, called \emph{strong
sparsification}, in which constraints are not removed but variables can be
merged. As our main result, we present a strong sparsification algorithm for
1-in-3-SAT. The correctness of the algorithm relies on establishing a
sub-quadratic bound on the size of certain sets of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$.
This result, obtained using the recent \emph{Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem}
(Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao, Ann. Math. 2025), could be of independent
interest. As an application, we improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for
approximating linearly-ordered colourings of 3-uniform hypergraphs (H{\aa}stad,

Motivation: 改进半整数TSP问题中的近似比，并探索更简单的证明方法。

Method: 通过使用对偶而非原始问题来分析匹配的期望成本，改进了近似比。

Result: 在半整数TSP问题中实现了1.49776的近似比，并在特定条件下进一步将近似比提升至1.4671。

Conclusion: 本文展示了最大熵算法在半整数TSP问题中的随机化1.49776近似比，优于Karlin等人之前提出的1.49993界限。此外，该方法还可能为证明最大熵在一般情况下优于3/2近似比提供更简单的证明。

Abstract: We show that the max entropy algorithm is a randomized 1.49776 approximation
for half-integral TSP, improving upon the previous known bound of 1.49993 from
Karlin et al. This also improves upon the best-known approximation for
half-integral TSP due to Gupta et al. Our improvement results from using the
dual, instead of the primal, to analyze the expected cost of the matching. We
believe this method of analysis could lead to a simpler proof that max entropy
is a better-than-3/2 approximation in the general case.
  We also give a 1.4671 approximation for half integral LP solutions with no
proper minimum cuts and an even number of vertices, improving upon the bound of
Haddadan and Newman of 1.476. We then extend the analysis to the case when
there are an odd number of vertices $n$ at the cost of an additional $O(1/n)$
factor.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种多项式时间算法，用于判断最大图中是否存在持续完美系统发育，填补了完美系统发育线性时间算法与Dollo-$k$（$k>1$）系统发育NP难结果之间的空白。

Abstract: The Persistent Perfect phylogeny, also known as Dollo-1, has been introduced
as a generalization of the well-known perfect phylogenetic model for binary
characters to deal with the potential loss of characters. The problem of
deciding the existence of a Persistent Perfect phylogeny can be reduced to the
one of recognizing a class of bipartite graphs whose nodes are species and
characters. Thus an interesting question is solving directly the problem of
recognizing such graphs. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding
Persistent Perfect phylogeny existence in maximal graphs, where no character's
species set is contained within another character's species set. Our solution,
that relies only on graph properties, narrows the gap between the linear-time
simple algorithm for Perfect Phylogeny and the NP-hardness results for the
Dollo-$k$ phylogeny with $k>1$.

Conclusion: 论文提出的零样本框架在动态概念个性化方面表现出色，无需实例微调即可生成高质量、一致的视频内容，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

Conclusion: GeoAvatar通过自适应几何高斯泼溅和创新的嘴部结构及变形策略，显著提升了3D头部avatar的重建和动画质量。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.
