TL;DR: TAGC模型通过自适应伽马校正提升低光照图像质量，适用于监控、医学图像和摄影等领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照条件下图像质量下降（如低对比度、噪声和模糊细节）是计算机视觉中的重要挑战。

Method: 基于分析低光照图像的色彩亮度和计算平均色彩来确定自适应伽马系数，无需人工干预。

Result: TAGC模型在定性和定量评估中均有效改善了低光照图像，保持了自然视觉质量。

Conclusion: TAGC模型通过自动计算自适应伽马系数，有效提升了低光照图像的质量，保持了细节和自然对比度，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

### [2] [Is Exchangeability better than I.I.D to handle Data Distribution Shifts while Pooling Data for Data-scarce Medical image segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19575)
*Ayush Roy,Samin Enam,Jun Xia,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Won Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文解决了医学图像数据稀缺和多源数据合并导致的分布偏移问题，提出了一种基于因果框架的特征控制方法，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像数据稀缺且多源数据合并可能导致分布偏移，影响模型性能（即“数据添加困境”）。

Method: 利用因果框架提出了一种控制深度网络各层前景-背景特征差异的方法，改善了特征表示。

Result: 在五个数据集（包括新贡献的超声数据集）上实现了最先进的医学图像分割性能，并生成了更精细的分割图。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种控制深度网络各层前景-背景特征差异的方法，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-MPEDNet是一种新型Transformer感知多尺度渐进编码器-解码器网络，用于CT扫描中肝脏和肿瘤的自动分割，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝脏和肿瘤的自动分割在快速诊断和制定最佳治疗计划中至关重要，但由于肿瘤的异质性和肝脏视觉特征的多样性，自动分割面临重大挑战。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder Network (T-MPEDNet)，结合深度自适应特征主干、渐进式编码器-解码器结构、Transformer启发的动态注意力机制和多尺度特征利用。

Result: 在LiTS和3DIRCADb数据集上，T-MPEDNet在肝脏和肿瘤分割上分别达到了97.6%、89.1%和98.3%、83.3%的Dice相似系数，优于12种最先进方法。

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet被证明是一种高效可靠的框架，用于CT扫描中肝脏及其肿瘤的自动分割。

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

### [4] [SurgPIS: Surgical-instrument-level Instances and Part-level Semantics for Weakly-supervised Part-aware Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19592)
*Meng Wei,Charlie Budd,Oluwatosin Alabi,Miaojing Shi,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgPIS 是首个解决手术工具部件感知实例分割（PIS）的模型，通过 transformer 和弱监督学习策略，在多项任务中实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手术工具分割方法仅单独处理仪器级实例分割（IIS）或部分级语义分割（PSS），缺乏任务间的交互。本文旨在通过统一的部件感知实例分割（PIS）问题解决这一局限性。

Method: 采用基于 transformer 的掩码分类方法，并引入从仪器级对象查询中派生的部分特定查询，明确将部分链接到其父仪器实例。此外，提出了一种弱监督学习策略，允许模型从仅标注 IIS 或 PSS 的不完整数据集中学习。

Result: SurgPIS 在多个数据集上的实验表明，其在 PIS、IIS、PSS 和仪器级语义分割任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: SurgPIS 在 PIS、IIS、PSS 和仪器级语义分割任务中均达到了最先进的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种支持文本和视觉提示交互的VideoLLM模型，通过STOM模块和VideoInfer数据集，在多模态视频理解任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有VideoLLMs模型仅关注高级理解且仅限于文本响应的局限性，提升对象中心、多轮交互的灵活性。

Method: 提出了STOM（时空覆盖模块）和VideoInfer数据集，STOM能够将任意视觉提示从单个时间戳传播到视频的其余帧，VideoInfer是一个手动策划的对象中心视频指令数据集。

Result: 在12个基准测试的6项任务中，提出的模型在视频问答和分割任务上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的VideoLLM模型在视频问答和分割任务中表现优于基线模型，展示了其在多模态、以对象为中心的视频和图像理解中的稳健性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

TL;DR: 提出Exemplar Med-DETR，一种多模态对比检测器，显著提升医学图像异常检测性能，在多种数据集上实现最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中的异常检测面临特征表示差异和解剖结构与异常之间复杂关系的挑战，现有方法难以学习有效的类特定特征。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的多模态对比检测器Exemplar Med-DETR，利用跨注意力机制和类特定示例特征，采用迭代训练策略。

Result: 在四种公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，包括越南密集乳腺钼靶片（质量检测mAP 0.7，钙化检测mAP 0.55）、中国队列（病变检测性能提升两倍）以及胸片和血管造影（质量和狭窄检测mAP分别提升4和7个百分点）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的Exemplar Med-DETR在多模态医学图像异常检测中表现出色，显著提升了检测性能，展示了其在医学影像分析中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIST is a modular toolkit for medical image segmentation, offering customizable postprocessing to improve segmentation quality, as demonstrated in the BraTS 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation lacks standardized and customizable tooling, making rigorous comparison between methods challenging.

Method: MIST's postprocessing module supports a wide range of transforms, including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies.

Result: The evaluation of three postprocessing strategies highlights MIST's ability to facilitate rapid experimentation and produce high-quality segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: MIST remains open source and extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynPAIN是一个大型合成数据集，用于解决疼痛检测中的多样性和偏见问题，显著提升了疼痛检测的准确性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有疼痛检测数据集在种族/民族多样性、隐私限制和老年人代表性不足方面的局限性，开发了SynPAIN数据集以解决这些问题。

Method: 使用商业生成AI工具创建了具有临床意义疼痛表情的合成数据集，并通过面部动作单元分析的临床验证工具进行验证。

Result: 验证显示合成疼痛表情表现出预期的疼痛模式，且在年龄匹配的合成数据增强下，真实临床数据的疼痛检测性能提高了7.0%。

Conclusion: SynPAIN填补了疼痛评估研究中的关键空白，提供了首个公开可用的、针对老年人疼痛检测设计的多样化合成数据集，并建立了测量和减轻算法偏见的框架。

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

*Mandar Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于DPO的标签高效半监督微调策略，通过PEFT和自一致性利用未标记数据，显著提升紧凑型VLMs在电商产品属性预测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手动或API标注的成本高昂，监督微调视觉语言模型（VLMs）面临规模挑战，因此探索标签高效的半监督微调策略。

Method: 研究采用PEFT训练低秩适配器模块，并通过DPO损失对适配器权重进行更新，利用自一致性将未标记数据的多个推理-答案链分为偏好和非偏好类别。

Result: 在涵盖12个电子商务领域的测试数据集上，基于DPO的微调方法显著优于监督模型，且随着未标记数据量的增加，准确率持续提升。

Conclusion: 通过DPO-based fine-tuning方法，仅利用未标记数据即可显著提升模型性能，且随着未标记数据量的增加，模型准确率进一步提升，表明该方法能有效利用大量未标记数据。

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Conclusion: DeepJIVE被证明是多模态数据分析的有用工具。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 尽管已有许多检测模型和数据集用于可靠识别合成内容，但这些模型和数据集可能存在偏差，导致对某些人口群体的检测失败，引发社会、法律和伦理问题。

Method: 本研究提出了一种利用合成数据生成的评估框架，该框架通过均匀分布的属性标签来减轻数据偏差对偏见分析结果的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，合成人脸检测器普遍存在对特定面部属性的偏见，且这种偏见与训练集中面部属性的平衡性以及检测器的激活图分析密切相关。

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

TL;DR: 通过预填充稀疏LiDAR数据，GRAFT-Stereo在稀疏条件下显著提升了立体匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过LiDAR引导提升立体匹配的精度，尤其是在LiDAR点稀疏的情况下。

Method: 研究在RAFT-Stereo框架中引入LiDAR引导，通过预填充稀疏初始视差图和早期融合LiDAR深度到图像特征中，解决了LiDAR点稀疏时性能下降的问题。

Result: GRAFT-Stereo在稀疏LiDAR条件下显著优于现有方法，证明了预填充策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的GRAFT-Stereo方法通过结合两种预填充策略，显著提升了在稀疏LiDAR条件下的立体匹配精度，为LiDAR引导的立体匹配方法提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

Motivation: 为了解决视频实例分割中长期实例跟踪的时序一致性问题，并提升在动态场景中对象频繁出现和消失时的匹配精度和身份一致性。

Method: LOMM的核心是Latest Object Memory (LOM)，它通过显式建模对象在每帧中的存在来鲁棒地跟踪并持续更新对象的最新状态。此外，Decoupled Object Association (DOA)策略分别处理新出现和已存在的对象，利用内存系统准确分配对象索引。

Result: LOMM在YouTube-VIS 2022数据集上取得了54.0的AP分数，优于传统方法，成为新的性能标杆。

Conclusion: LOMM方法在视频实例分割中显著提升了长期实例跟踪的时序一致性，通过LOM和DOA策略的结合，实现了对象状态的持续更新和准确身份管理，从而在动态场景中提高了匹配精度和身份一致性。该方法在YouTube-VIS 2022数据集上达到了54.0的AP分数，树立了新的性能标杆。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上广泛使用的面部修饰技术引发了关于面部图像真实性的担忧。现有方法主要集中在检测面部修饰，而如何从修饰后的图像中准确恢复原始面部尚未得到解答。

Method: MoFRR采用了深寻的专家隔离策略，结合稀疏激活的专用专家和共享专家，通过双分支结构（DDIM-based低频率分支和Cross-Attention-based高频率分支）实现面部修饰的恢复。

Result: 在RetouchingFFHQ++数据集上的大量实验证明了MoFRR在FRR任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为MoFRR的新方法，通过混合扩散模型有效解决了面部修饰恢复（FRR）任务中的复杂挑战，特别是在处理不同类型和程度的面部修饰时表现出色。

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

Motivation: 尽管MAE在自监督表示学习中表现优异，但其具体学习机制尚不明确。本文旨在深入分析MAE的学习过程，并提出改进方法。

Method: 提出了一种自引导掩码自编码器，通过内部生成的智能掩码替代传统MAE的随机掩码，利用补丁聚类信息优化学习过程。

Result: 在多种下游任务上的实验验证了所提方法的有效性，显著提升了学习效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的自引导掩码自编码器（MAE）通过利用其内部学习的补丁聚类信息生成更智能的掩码，显著提升了学习效率，同时保持了自监督学习的优势。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力机制在点云学习中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了长距离依赖建模，而选择性状态空间模型（S6）虽有线性复杂度优势，但在点云序列化和局部学习方面仍有不足。

Method: 设计了一个shuffle serialization策略和ConvBiS6层，结合了局部几何和全局上下文依赖的协同捕获，并扩展了多头设计到S6（MHS6）。

Result: HydraMamba在对象级和场景级任务中均取得了最先进的效果。

Conclusion: HydraMamba通过创新的shuffle serialization策略和ConvBiS6层，成功解决了点云序列化和局部学习的不足，在对象级和场景级任务中达到了最先进的效果。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法复杂度高且计算成本大，不适用于实时应用，且分离的湍流缓解和目标检测导致效率低下。

Method: JDATT结合了最先进的AT缓解和检测模块，采用特征级（CWD和MGD）和输出级（KL散度）蒸馏策略。

Result: 在合成和真实湍流数据集上，JDATT实现了优越的视觉恢复和检测精度，同时显著减小模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: JDATT框架通过联合蒸馏策略，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了模型复杂度和推理时间，适用于实时部署。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

Motivation: 现有的基于空间变换的方法无法生成真实的光流数据，限制了视频显著目标检测模型的训练效果。

Method: TransFlow利用预训练的视频扩散模型中的语义运动先验知识，从静态图像生成具有自然运动模式的光流数据。

Result: TransFlow在多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了运动知识迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: TransFlow通过利用预训练视频扩散模型中的运动知识，成功生成了语义感知的光流数据，显著提升了视频显著目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: DepthFlow通过合成光流数据显著提升了无监督视频对象分割的性能，解决了训练数据稀缺问题，并在所有公共VOS基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

Motivation: The rapid expansion of datasets and computational demands has created a need for architectures that deliver high performance with fewer resources, especially in diverse and resource-constrained environments.

Method: The dissertation explores three approaches: optimizing data ingress and egress, modifying core neural architectures (e.g., restricted attention in vision transformers), and leveraging natural structures of Normalizing Flows for knowledge distillation.

Result: The proposed architectural principles demonstrate improved performance while reducing computational demands.

Conclusion: Careful design of neural architectures can enhance the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, making them smaller, faster, and more cost-effective.

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

Motivation: 现有Transformer检测器中的固定查询机制存在灵活性不足、学习效率低（因ROT问题）和查询歧义（违反DETR的一对一匹配原则）等问题。

Method: 提出DS-Det，采用统一单查询范式和解耦注意力学习（通过Cross-Attention定位框，Self-Attention去重预测），并引入PoCoo损失优化小目标检测。

Result: 在COCO2017和WiderPerson数据集上的广泛实验表明，DS-Det在多种骨干模型下均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DS-Det通过引入新的统一单查询范式和解耦注意力学习，有效解决了固定查询的局限性、查询歧义和ROT问题，显著提升了检测器的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

Conclusion: SeeDiff 方法直接从 Stable Diffusion 生成高质量掩码，无需额外训练、提示调整或预训练分割网络。

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统连续手语识别方法中因多阶段流程导致的错误传播、过拟合和词汇扩展性受限的问题。

Method: 提出AutoSign，一种自回归解码器专用Transformer模型，结合1D CNN进行时间压缩，并利用预训练的AraGPT2生成文本（glosses），直接映射姿态序列到自然语言文本。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，AutoSign的WER得分比现有最佳方法提高了6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoSign通过消除多阶段流程，直接在姿态序列和自然语言文本之间建立映射，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能，特别是在Isharah-1000数据集上WER得分提高了6.1%。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的负提示调优方法在增强视觉语言模型OOD检测能力时，常导致对未见类和风格的泛化性能下降。

Method: 提出了Knowledge Regularized Negative Feature Tuning (KR-NFT)，包含Negative Feature Tuning (NFT)架构和知识正则化(KR)优化策略。NFT通过分布感知变换分离正负特征，KR策略优化ID与OOD的区分。

Result: 在ImageNet少样本学习场景下，KR-NFT不仅提升了ID分类准确率和OOD检测性能，还将FPR95降低了5.44%。

Conclusion: KR-NFT通过结合NFT架构和KR优化策略，显著提升了OOD检测性能，同时减少了预训练知识遗忘，并在少样本学习场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

Conclusion: 该论文通过提出FineMotion数据集，显著提升了文本驱动细粒度人体运动生成任务的性能，并支持零样本细粒度运动编辑。

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Mamba的方法在姿态提升任务中难以建模复杂的关节连接和统一处理所有关节运动轨迹，同时忽视了运动特性的内在差异。

Method: SAMA框架包含两个关键模块：结构感知状态整合器（SSI）和运动自适应状态调制器（MSM）。SSI基于姿态拓扑动态融合关节特征和状态信息，MSM则识别关节特定的运动特征并调整不同关节的运动模式。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAMA算法取得了先进的性能，且计算成本较低。

Conclusion: SAMA框架通过结构感知和运动自适应的设计，显著提升了姿态提升任务的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了先进的结果，同时计算成本更低。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

Motivation: 当前4D雷达与单目图像的融合方法缺乏整体场景理解或受限于固定网格结构，RaGS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RaGS采用级联流程构建和优化高斯场，包括Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI)、Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)和Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF)。

Result: 在View-of-Delft、TJ4DRadSet和OmniHD-Scenes基准测试中达到领先性能。

Conclusion: RaGS框架通过3D高斯溅射技术有效融合4D雷达与单目图像数据，在多个基准测试中表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前开放世界物体检测方法对大量标注数据的依赖、部分特征过拟合问题以及模型架构修改的局限性。

Method: OW-CLIP 采用即插即用的多模态提示调优和新型“Crop-Smoothing”技术，结合双模态数据精炼方法，利用大语言模型和跨模态相似性进行数据生成与过滤。

Result: OW-CLIP 仅需 3.8% 的自生成数据即可达到 89% 的最先进性能，且在数据量相同时超越现有方法。

Conclusion: OW-CLIP 在开放世界物体检测（OWOD）中表现出色，仅需少量自生成数据即可达到接近最先进水平的性能，并在数据量相当的情况下超越现有方法。

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

Motivation: 解决多任务MedIR中因任务异质性导致的不同信息损失问题，现有方法难以处理这些多样化的信息损失。

Method: DiffCode提出了一种潜在扩散增强的向量量化码本先验，构建任务自适应码本库以整合跨任务的特定高质量先验特征，并引入潜在扩散策略来细化潜在特征分布。

Result: DiffCode在MRI超分辨率、CT去噪和PET合成等任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffCode通过任务自适应码本库和潜在扩散策略，在MRI超分辨率、CT去噪和PET合成等MedIR任务中实现了卓越的定量指标和视觉质量。

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言跟踪器（VLTs）难以动态适应目标状态的变化，尤其是在复杂长期场景中，且对多样化表达的文本提示难以有效利用。

Method: 1. 视觉模态：提出了一种有效的时序视觉目标-上下文建模方法；2. 文本模态：实现了基于文本内容的精确目标词识别，并设计了一种创新的上下文词校准方法。

Result: 在主流基准测试中，ATCTrack取得了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ATCTrack通过全面的目标-上下文特征建模，实现了与动态目标状态对齐的多模态线索，从而实现了鲁棒的视觉-语言跟踪。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and

Result: 在五个真实数据集（Cityscapes、BDD100K、Mapillary、IDD和ACDC）上的实验显示，全局模型显著优于单个客户端模型。

Conclusion: FedS2R框架在自动驾驶的合成到真实语义分割任务中表现优异，全局模型显著优于单个客户端模型，且仅比同时访问所有客户端数据的模型低2 mIoU点。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

Result: 在 15 个开源 VLM 中的 11 个中，RCA 提高了 FitAP 指标，最高提升达 +26.6%。

Conclusion: RCA 为多模态变换器提供了可解释性和性能提升，适用于多种视觉语言模型。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

Conclusion: TrackAny3D 展示了在类别无关的3D单目标跟踪中的卓越性能，强调了统一模型的重要性，并扩展了大规模预训练模型在该领域的应用。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

*Yuxuan Jiang,Chenwei Yu,Zhi Lin,Xiaolan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合记忆库和无解码器框架的迷你批量训练策略，用于深度子空间聚类，显著提升了计算效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度子空间聚类方法依赖于全批量处理，这在处理高分辨率图像时存在计算瓶颈，限制了深度架构的可扩展训练。

Method: 通过集成一个保存全局特征表示的记忆库，提出了一种用于深度子空间聚类的迷你批量训练策略，并设计了一个利用对比学习而非自动编码进行表示学习的无解码器框架。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在COIL100和ORL数据集上实现了与全批量方法相当的性能，并优于其他最先进的子空间聚类方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了与全批量方法相当的性能，而且通过微调深度网络在COIL100和ORL数据集上优于其他最先进的子空间聚类方法。

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

Method: HumanSAM通过融合视频理解和空间深度两个分支来生成人类伪造表示，并在训练过程中采用基于排名的置信度增强策略，通过学习三个先验分数来获得更稳健的表示。

Result: HumanSAM成功将人类中心伪造分为三类常见的人工制品：空间、外观和运动异常，并在实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: HumanSAM在二进制和多类伪造分类中均显示出有希望的结果，优于现有最先进的方法。

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Method: 提出MambaVesselNet++，一种混合CNN-Mamba框架，包括混合图像编码器（Hi-Encoder）和双焦点融合解码器（BF-Decoder）。Hi-Encoder通过卷积捕获低层语义特征，并利用Mamba建模长距离依赖关系；BF-Decoder通过跳跃连接结合局部和全局信息生成分割掩码。

Conclusion: MambaVesselNet++通过结合CNN和Mamba的优势，在医学图像分割任务中表现出色，超越了现有基于卷积、Transformer和Mamba的最先进方法。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有空间控制方法在复杂文本提示（如多对象或复杂空间组合）下生成图像时表现不佳，需提升控制精度。

Method: 利用多模态LLM作为全局控制器，通过优化空间布局、增强语义描述和绑定对象属性，生成控制信号并注入去噪网络以调整注意力图。

Result: LLM_Control在多种预训练T2I模型上实现了高质量的图像生成，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLM_Control通过增强多模态LLM的全局控制能力，显著提升了复杂空间组合文本提示下的图像生成精度，并在多种预训练T2I模型上展现了竞争力。

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Conclusion: UniCT Depth通过结合CNN和Transformer的优势，成功解决了现有方法在局部和全局特征建模上的不足，显著提升了深度估计的性能。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

Conclusion: AF-CLIP通过增强视觉表示和优化文本提示，在零样本和少样本场景下表现出色，并在多个工业与医学数据集中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio
(Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly
projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting
comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of
encoding models to novel movie stimuli. All code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a
classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on
grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

Conclusion: FROSS 提出了一种创新的在线且快于实时的3D语义场景图生成方法，通过将2D场景图直接提升到3D空间并采用3D高斯分布表示物体，显著提高了性能并降低了计算需求。

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

Abstract: Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained
significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate
the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model
generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and
self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research.
However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised
learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting
variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the
performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in
the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same
source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them
on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final
performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such
as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison
experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally,
we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and
self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于OCTA图像的多功能心血管疾病风险评估范式，通过结合血管特征和形态学知识，显著提高了预测准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes

Conclusion: RICE模型通过引入区域感知聚类判别方法，显著提升了区域级视觉和OCR能力，并在分割、密集检测及MLLMs的视觉感知任务中表现优异。预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

*Ze Rong,ZiYue Zhao,Zhaoxin Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaRMamba通过频域和空间重建模块，解决了医学图像分割中的高频信息丢失和空间结构退化问题，显著提升了分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Vision Mamba方法在建模全局依赖时，导致局部高频信息捕获不足和二维空间结构退化，加剧了医学图像分割中的边界模糊和高频细节丢失问题。

Method: FaRMamba通过多尺度频率变换模块（MSFM）和自监督重建辅助编码器（SSRAE）两个互补模块，分别恢复高频信息和二维空间结构。

Result: 在CAMUS超声心动图、MRI小鼠耳蜗和Kvasir-Seg内窥镜数据集上的评估表明，FaRMamba在边界准确性、细节保留和全局一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaRMamba提供了一种灵活的频域感知框架，有效解决了医学图像分割中的核心挑战，如边界模糊和高频细节丢失，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）具备强大的视觉和语言基础，但图像描述往往缺乏细节，基础模型生成的描述简短且通用。

Method: 提出了一种无监督方法，用于减少模型在交叉熵训练中过早预测EOS令牌的偏向。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著增加了描述长度和细节，尽管幻觉率有所增加。

Conclusion: 通过减少对EOS令牌的偏向，我们的方法能够在不依赖复杂奖励函数或监督的情况下，生成更长、更详细的图像描述。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: LPA方法通过分解提示词为内容和风格标记，并选择性注入U-Net的注意力层，显著提升了布局控制和风格一致性，为可控、表达性强的扩散模型生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

Conclusion: Local2Global框架在视频实例分割任务中表现出色，通过简单的在线训练实现了最先进的性能，特别是在YouTube-VIS和OVIS数据集上取得了显著成果。

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为GT-mean loss的损失函数，有效解决了低光图像增强（LLIE）中亮度不匹配的问题，并通过实验证明了其在多种方法和数据集上的性能提升。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\
\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,
training data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet
existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel
reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion
Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based
video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We
introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture
semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract
fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work
synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a
multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image
color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor
outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal
consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of
the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for
industrial applications. The code will be made publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体育视频描述方法常忽略球员身份，导致描述不完整或不准确，影响了其实际应用。

Method: 设计了身份相关信息提取模块（IRIEM）和视觉上下文学习模块（VCLM），结合大型语言模型（LLM）生成带球员身份的描述。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM-IAVC在NBA-Identity和VC-NBA-2022数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文提出的LLM-IAVC模型通过多模态提示生成网络，有效解决了体育视频描述中球员身份识别的问题，并在NBA-Identity和VC-NBA-2022数据集上验证了其先进性能。

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

TL;DR: PUMPS是一种针对TPC数据的自编码器架构，通过降维和采样标识符优化运动合成任务，预训练表现优异，微调后性能超越专门方法。

Motivation: 传统骨骼动画在跨骨骼运动数据迁移时因比例或结构差异面临挑战。TPC作为一种无结构、跨兼容的运动表示方式，虽与骨骼可逆，但缺乏直接用于运动任务学习的数据合成能力。

Method: PUMPS通过独立降维帧级点云为可采样特征向量，利用潜在高斯噪声向量作为采样标识符，解码器从中提取时间点。采用线性分配点配对优化重建过程，避免昂贵的逐点注意力机制。

Result: PUMPS在运动预测、过渡生成和关键帧插值等预训练任务中表现优异，无需原生数据集监督即可达到最先进水平。在运动去噪或估计任务中微调后，性能超越许多专门方法。

Conclusion: PUMPS提出了一种创新的自编码器架构，用于处理TPC数据，无需昂贵的数据标注即可实现高性能的运动合成任务，并在微调后超越了许多专门方法。

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

Conclusion: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在空间理解能力上有显著提升空间，人类表现近乎完美，而模型仅在两个最简单任务上达到人类水平。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive

Method: 提出了一种动态多级图像融合网络MoCTEFuse，采用光照门控的Mixture of Chiral Transformer Experts (MoCTE)，通过Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB)动态切换主辅模态并分配权重，结合多阶段堆叠和竞争性损失函数进行训练。

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse通过动态多级图像融合网络，利用光照门控的MoCTE技术，成功在红外和可见光图像融合中平衡了纹理细节和对象对比度，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

Conclusion: SAMwave通过小波变换提取多尺度高频特征，并引入复值适配器，显著提升了SAM在复杂任务中的性能，证明了其高效性、灵活性和可解释性。

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

Conclusion: 本调查旨在整合当前进展，识别关键挑战，并激发这一快速演进领域中未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

Result: The model achieves an overall accuracy of 83.63%, outperforming other comparative models and achieving the best performance across all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-branch fusion model significantly improves the accuracy of mining area scene classification by effectively integrating global and local features, achieving an overall accuracy of 83.63%.

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GS 的训练过程因密度化效率低和高斯原语空间分布不优而收敛缓慢，影响了重建质量和计算效率。

Method: 提出了一种全局到局部的密度化策略，结合能量引导的粗到细多分辨率训练框架，并动态修剪不必要的高斯原语。

Result: 在 MipNeRF-360、Deep Blending 和 Tanks & Temples 数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著加速了训练，减少了高斯原语数量，并提升了重建性能。

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) 通过全局到局部的密度化策略和能量引导的多分辨率训练框架，显著提升了训练速度（超过2倍加速）并减少了高斯原语数量，同时实现了卓越的重建性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生动物监测中，间接证据（如足迹、粪便）的物种识别仍未被充分探索，但这对生物多样性保护至关重要。

Method: 通过构建一个包含159,605个边界框的大规模数据集AnimalClue，涵盖五种间接证据类型（足迹、粪便、蛋、骨头和羽毛），覆盖968个物种。数据集标注包括物种级标签、边界框或分割掩码，以及细粒度特征信息。

Result: 实验评估了多种视觉模型，并识别了从动物痕迹中进行物种识别的关键挑战。

Conclusion: AnimalClue数据集填补了野生动物间接证据识别领域的空白，为物种识别和监测提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 EEG 基础模型忽视了范式特定的神经生理学差异，限制了其泛化能力。在实际 BCI 部署中，范式（如 MI）通常在数据采集前就已确定，因此需要一种专门针对 MI 范式的模型。

Method: MIRepNet 包含一个高质量的 EEG 预处理管道，采用神经生理学启发的通道模板，并引入结合自监督掩码令牌重建和监督 MI 分类的混合预训练策略。

Result: MIRepNet 在五个公开 MI 数据集上均取得了最先进的性能，显著优于专用和通用的 EEG 模型。

Conclusion: MIRepNet 是一种专门为运动想象（MI）范式设计的 EEG 基础模型，通过结合神经生理学知识的预处理管道和混合预训练策略，显著提升了模型在新下游 MI 任务上的适应性和解码准确性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on

Motivation: 解决标签稀缺和异构模态对齐问题，提高遥感图像分类的效率和准确性。

Method: L-MCAT 引入了两种核心创新：Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) 用于压缩高维传感器输入到统一嵌入空间，以及 Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA)，一种集成到注意力层中的对比自监督机制，用于对齐异构模态而无需像素级对应或标签。

Result: 在 SEN12MS 数据集上，L-MCAT 仅使用每类 20 个标签即达到 95.4% 的总体准确率，优于现有基线方法，同时参数和计算量大幅减少。即使在 50% 空间错位情况下，仍保持 92% 以上的准确率。

Conclusion: L-MCAT 是一种高效的轻量级多模态对比注意力 Transformer 框架，能够在标签稀缺的情况下实现对遥感图像的分类，且在实际部署中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer
(L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote

introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that
compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and
23x fewer FLOPs than MCTrans. It maintains over 92% accuracy even under 50%

Motivation: 随着人工智能的广泛应用，开发可信赖的AI变得至关重要。然而，深度神经网络容易学习数据集中的伪相关性，因此需要提高其可靠性。

Method: 通过量化目标与偏置特征的线性相关性（协方差矩阵），并利用白化模块消除这种相关性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的可控特征白化框架有效减轻了偏置，同时避免了高阶依赖建模的复杂性，且在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

Motivation: 现有假新闻视频检测方法因不同事件短视频新闻间存在分布偏移，尤其在紧急新闻记录上表现不佳，缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 设计了基于Mask Language Modeling（MLM）的自监督辅助任务，通过多模态（音频和视频）上下文信息预测被遮蔽的词语，测试时训练阶段通过辅助任务适应测试数据分布。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的大量实验证明了该模型的有效性，尤其是对紧急新闻的检测。

Conclusion: 提出的T$^3$SVFND框架通过测试时训练（TTT）显著提升了假新闻视频检测的鲁棒性，特别是在紧急新闻检测方面表现优异。

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

TL;DR: TVT策略通过优化VAE下采样率和UNet架构，显著提升图像超分辨率中精细结构的重建效果，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于预训练稳定扩散模型的Real-ISR方法在重建图像精细结构（如小字符和纹理）时表现不佳的问题。

Method: 采用Transfer VAE Training (TVT)策略，将8倍下采样的VAE转换为4倍下采样，并优化网络架构以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验证明TVT方法在保持精细结构方面优于其他基于SD的方法，且计算量更少。

Conclusion: 提出的TVT策略显著提升了图像超分辨率中精细结构的重建效果，同时计算效率优于现有一步扩散模型。

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT是一种快速通用的跨传感器适应框架，通过无监督采样和梯度分析，仅更新关键权重，显著提升全色锐化模型的跨传感器性能，适应时间仅需一分钟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于深度学习的方法在全色锐化任务中表现良好，但在应用于未见过的传感器数据时性能严重下降。全面重新训练或设计更复杂架构的方法成本高昂且不切实际，因此需要一种快速且通用的跨传感器适应框架。

Method: SWIFT采用基于数据流形结构的无监督采样策略，平衡样本选择并减轻传统Farthest Point Sampling的偏差，高效选择目标域中最具信息量的3%样本。随后通过分析预训练模型的梯度行为，快速识别并仅更新对域偏移最敏感的权重子集。

Result: SWIFT将适应时间从数小时缩短至约一分钟（单NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU），且适应后的模型性能显著优于直接迁移基线，甚至在某些情况下与完全重新训练相当或更优。

Conclusion: SWIFT框架显著提升了跨传感器全色锐化任务的性能，不仅大幅超越直接迁移基线，甚至在某些情况下优于完全重新训练，为WorldView-2和QuickBird数据集设定了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种结合3D渲染和2D扩散模型的混合方法，用于在动态视频中插入3D物体，实现了时间一致性和真实光照的平衡。

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a

aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

TL;DR: SpatialVTS方法通过视觉和文本思维两阶段设计，显著提升了模型在空间推理任务中的表现，且无需额外信息。数据集优化进一步支持了模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）发展迅速，但在空间推理任务中表现仍不理想。本文旨在通过同时结合视觉和文本思维，提升模型的空间推理能力。

Method: SpatialVTS方法分为两个阶段：空间视觉思维阶段（生成与位置相关的特定标记）和空间文本思维阶段（基于视觉线索和对话进行长期思考）。此外，对现有数据集进行了手动修正和结构调整。

Result: 在未引入额外信息的情况下，模型在多个空间理解任务中的整体平均水平显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的SpatialVTS方法通过结合视觉和文本思维，显著提升了模型在空间推理任务中的表现，无需引入额外信息（如掩码或深度）。

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Motivation: 卡通动画生成面临非人类角色的复杂性、风格多样的动作和细粒度情感表达的挑战，且公开的多模态卡通数据稀缺。

Method: 提出了MagicAnime数据集和MagicAnime-Bench基准测试，包含大规模、分层标注和多模态数据，支持多种视频生成任务。

Result: MagicAnime数据集包含400k视频剪辑用于图像到视频生成，50k视频剪辑对用于全身标注，12k视频剪辑对用于视频到视频面部动画，2.9k视频和音频对用于音频驱动面部动画。

Conclusion: MagicAnime数据集及其基准测试在支持高保真、细粒度和可控的动画生成方面表现出有效性。

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

TL;DR: T2I-Copilot 是一种无需训练的多智能体系统，通过协作优化文本到图像生成的提示工程，显著提升生成质量和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型对提示措辞高度敏感且缺乏明确反馈，现有方法控制有限或需额外训练。

Method: T2I-Copilot 由三个智能体组成：输入解释器、生成引擎和质量评估器，通过协作实现自动化提示优化和模型选择。

Result: 在 GenAI-Bench 上，T2I-Copilot 的 VQA 分数与商业模型相当，成本效益显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot 通过多智能体协作显著简化了提示工程，提升了生成质量和文本-图像对齐，且在成本效益上优于多个商业模型。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

TL;DR: ModalFormer是一个多模态低光图像增强框架，通过跨模态Transformer和辅助子网络融合多模态信息，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强（LLIE）任务面临噪声、细节丢失和对比度差的挑战，现有方法通常仅依赖RGB图像的像素级变换，忽略了多模态信息的丰富上下文。

Method: ModalFormer包含两个主要组件：跨模态Transformer（CM-T）和多个辅助子网络。CM-T通过CM-MSA机制融合RGB数据与多模态特征（如深度特征嵌入、分割信息、几何线索和颜色信息），生成信息丰富的混合注意力图。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ModalFormer在LLIE任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: ModalFormer通过利用多模态信息和创新的跨模态多头自注意力机制（CM-MSA），在低光图像增强（LLIE）任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

TL;DR: MemoryTalker 通过两阶段训练（记忆和动画），仅用音频输入即可生成个性化3D面部动画，无需额外先验信息，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决以往方法需要先验信息（如说话者类别标签或额外3D面部网格）的问题，以提升实用性和反映说话风格。

Method: 框架分为两个训练阶段：1）存储和检索通用运动（记忆阶段）；2）通过音频驱动的说话风格特征对运动记忆进行个性化面部运动合成（动画阶段）。

Result: 通过定量、定性评估和用户研究，证明MemoryTalker在个性化面部动画方面的有效性和性能提升。

Conclusion: MemoryTalker 能够仅通过音频输入生成可靠且个性化的面部动画，无需额外的先验信息，显著提升了实用性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统方法通过最小化重构损失逐帧对齐真实数据，但忽略了面部运动的连续性，导致输出不自然。

Method: 提出了一种音素上下文感知损失函数，引入音素协同发音权重，根据面部运动的动态变化自适应调整重要性。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于传统重构损失方法。

Conclusion: 论文通过提出一种新颖的音素上下文感知损失函数，成功解决了传统帧对齐方法在3D面部动画中无法捕捉运动连续性的问题，显著提升了动画的平滑度和视觉质量。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶数据收集快速发展，但3D标签的手动标注成本高、劳动强度大，成为主要瓶颈。现有的LiDAR自动标注方法受限于数据稀疏性、遮挡和不完整观察，且缺乏语义粒度。

Method: VESPA 是一种多模态自动标注管道，结合了LiDAR的几何精度和相机图像的语义丰富性，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）实现开放词汇对象标注，并直接在点云域中优化检测质量。

Result: 在Nuscenes数据集上，VESPA在对象发现和多类对象检测中分别达到了52.95%和46.54%的AP，表现出色。

Conclusion: VESPA 展示了在多模态自动标注中的强大性能，能够在不依赖地面真实标注或高清地图的情况下，生成高质量的3D伪标签，支持新类别的发现，并在Nuscenes数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 论文提出的轻量级RSSC框架（包括蒸馏的全局滤波器网络模型和动态提前退出机制）在边缘设备上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了推理速度和能源效率，同时保持了高分类精度。

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"
team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,
improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,

TL;DR: TransPrune利用token表示变化和指令关注度剪枝视觉token，显著降低计算成本且性能无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力的token重要性评估方法存在局限性（如位置偏差），而token表示的变化能提供语义信息信号。

Method: 提出TransPrune，一种无需训练的高效token剪枝方法，通过TTV（衡量token表示的变化）和IGA（衡量指令对图像token的关注程度）评估token重要性。

Result: TransPrune在8个基准测试中保持与原始LVLMs（如LLaVA-v1.5和LLaVA-Next）相当的多模态性能，同时将推理TFLOPs减少一半以上。TTV单独使用也表现优异。

Conclusion: TransPrune通过结合Token Transition Variation (TTV)和Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA)，在保持LVLMs多模态性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本。TTV本身也可作为独立标准，性能媲美基于注意力的方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at

Conclusion: 该研究通过开发一个基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的实时印度手语（ISL）检测与翻译系统，显著提升了聋哑人士的沟通效率，分类准确率达到99.95%，为印度聋哑社区提供了高效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to

Motivation: 生理信号情绪识别面临多模态信号不完备及身体运动和伪影干扰的挑战。

Method: 提出了Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net)，整合了模态查询、类别查询和干扰查询机制。

Result: 实验结果表明MMQ-Net在数据高度不完备情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMQ-Net通过多查询机制有效解决了生理信号中的不完备性和干扰问题，显著提升了情绪识别的性能。

Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological data is crucial for mental health
assessment, yet it faces two significant challenges: incomplete multi-modal
signals and interference from body movements and artifacts. This paper presents
a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from
incomplete signals, category queries to focus on emotional state features, and
interference queries to separate relevant information from noise. Extensive
experiment results demonstrate the superior emotion recognition performance of
MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data
incompleteness.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种联合学习3D人脸重建和说话头合成模型的方法，显著提高了生成的面部质量，并通过优化的FACS混合形状表示实现了基于音频的唇部同步。

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

TL;DR: ReSoRA提出了一种自适应正则化低秩适应子空间冗余的方法，有效提升参数高效迁移学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练过程中投影矩阵不受限制，导致高表示冗余，影响特征适应效果，且缺乏灵活性，泛化能力差。

Method: ReSoRA将低秩子矩阵分解为多个等效子空间，并系统地对不同投影间的特征分布施加去冗余约束。

Result: 实验表明，ReSoRA在多种骨干网络和数据集上均能提升现有最先进的参数高效迁移学习方法的性能。

Conclusion: ReSoRA通过显式建模和自适应正则化低秩适应的子空间冗余，有效提升了参数高效迁移学习的性能，且无需额外推理成本。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: SparseVAR 是一种无需额外训练的加速框架，通过动态排除低频标记降低计算成本，显著提升视觉自回归模型的高分辨率生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉自回归模型在高分辨率阶段因大量标记导致计算开销巨大，而低频标记对图像质量影响较小且与相邻标记相似。

Method: SparseVAR 利用轻量级 MSE 指标识别低频标记，并通过少量均匀采样的锚标记保持被排除区域的保真度。

Result: SparseVAR 在 HART 和 Infinity 中实现了显著加速，Infinity-2B 中最高达到 2 倍加速且质量损失极小。

Conclusion: SparseVAR 是一种即插即用的加速框架，通过动态排除低频标记在推理阶段显著降低计算成本，同时保持高质量的图像生成效果。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

Motivation: 传统视觉系统仅能从场景物体的可见表面提取信息，无法判断不透明容器内的液体水平。本文旨在通过振动感知解决这一限制。

Method: 提出了一种基于散斑的振动感知系统，用于同时捕获2D网格点上的场景振动，并开发了一种基于Transformer的方法来分析振动并分类容器类型及其隐藏液体水平。

Result: 该方法能够在不进行物理操作和手动称重的情况下，远程同时检查多个密封容器的填充水平，且模型对振动源具有不变性，能够泛化到未见过的容器实例和流体水平。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通过感知不透明容器表面微小振动来推断隐藏液体水平的新方法，扩展了计算机视觉的应用范围。

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Motivation: 现有临床MIL任务方法未能充分解决病理症状和诊断类别之间的优先级问题，导致MIL模型忽略类别间的优先级。

Method: 提出了一种解决优先级问题的新方法，采用垂直和水平两个层次结构，通过在每个层次上对齐MIL预测，并在训练中利用隐式特征可重用性，促进同一层次内临床更严重的类别。

Conclusion: 实验证明，该方法在真实患者数据中有效减少了误诊，并在多类别场景中优先考虑更重要的症状。进一步分析验证了所提出组件的有效性，并定性地确认了MIL预测在具有多种症状的复杂病例中的表现。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于田间环境的复杂性和水稻颖花的小尺寸及短暂开花期，自动化且精确的识别仍具挑战性，因此需要开发一种高效的方法来准确检测水稻开花时间。

Method: 本研究提出了一种基于改进YOLOv8目标检测模型的水稻颖花开花识别方法，包括使用双向特征金字塔网络（BiFPN）替换原始PANet结构以增强特征融合，以及添加p2小目标检测头以提高小目标检测能力。

Result: 改进后的YOLOv8s-p2模型在mAP@0.5、精确率、召回率和F1分数上分别比基线YOLOv8提高了3.10%、8.40%、10.80%和9.79%，且运行速度为69 f/s，满足实际应用需求。

Conclusion: 改进后的YOLOv8s-p2模型在准确性和速度上表现优异，为杂交水稻种子生产中的自动化监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a

Motivation: 小样本学习（FSL）因数据稀缺面临挑战，现有CLIP-like方法仅通过类别名称嵌入对齐视觉表示，可能损害视觉多样性。因此，需要一种更全面的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的小样本学习方法（BCT-CLIP），通过多属性生成器（MPG）和LLM辅助检索过程生成视觉属性标记，并采用新的对比学习策略进行属性标记学习。

Result: 在11个广泛使用的数据集上取得了优越的性能，表明主导属性的探索有助于提升类别特定的表示学习和小样本分类。

Conclusion: 通过探索主导属性并利用LLM的先验知识，BCT-CLIP方法显著提升了小样本学习的分类性能，证明了其在11个广泛使用的数据集上的优越性。

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

Motivation: 计算病理学中，模型在不同扫描仪下的可靠性是一个关键挑战。扫描仪差异会导致全切片图像的变异性，影响患者诊断和治疗规划。过去的研究未直接评估同一组织在不同扫描仪下的一致性，因此需要新的数据集和方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 引入SCORPION数据集，包含480个组织样本，每个样本用5台扫描仪扫描，生成2,400个空间对齐的补丁。提出SimCons框架，结合基于增强的领域泛化技术和一致性损失，以解决扫描仪泛化问题。

Conclusion: 通过发布SCORPION数据集和提出SimCons框架，本研究为计算病理学领域提供了评估和改进模型跨扫描仪一致性的关键资源，并设立了可靠性测试的新标准。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人脸伪造检测中的跨域泛化挑战，传统方法因依赖简单分类目标而难以学习域不变表示。

Method: 提出HAMLET-FFD框架，基于对比视觉-语言模型（如CLIP），通过双向融合机制和知识精炼循环，结合视觉证据与概念线索进行真实性评估。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出对未见操纵的优越泛化能力，视觉分析显示嵌入表示在细粒度伪影识别中的分工。

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD通过双向跨模态推理和知识精炼循环，显著提升了跨域人脸伪造检测的泛化能力，同时保留了CLIP的原始能力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将文本表示与视频表示对齐会导致错误监督，忽略信息的不等价性。

Method: 提出T2VParser，通过自适应分解标记（Adaptive Decomposition Tokens）提取文本和视频的多视角语义表示，实现自适应语义对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，T2VParser通过有效的跨模态内容分解实现了准确的局部对齐。

Conclusion: T2VParser通过有效的跨模态内容分解实现了准确的局部对齐，同时保留了预训练模型的知识。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease
identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的安全机制无法自然扩展到视觉模态，导致其易受有害图像输入的影响。

Method: 引入了安全张量（可训练的输入向量），通过文本或视觉模态在推理中应用，无需修改模型参数。使用包含恶意图像-文本对、对比良性对和一般良性样本的精选数据集进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，文本和视觉安全张量显著增强了LVLMs拒绝有害视觉输入的能力，同时保持良性任务的性能。内部分析显示，安全张量成功激活了语言模块的文本“安全层”来处理视觉输入。

Conclusion: 安全张量成功地将基于文本的安全机制扩展到视觉模态，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）对有害视觉输入的拒绝能力，同时保持了良性任务的性能。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic
grain classification system for green lentils (Lens Culinaris), which leverages
computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited
processing rate of 8 grams per minute, the prototype demonstrates the potential
of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for
future enhancements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决草图质量评估问题，因手绘草图通常难以准确表现对象，需要一种无需人工标注的自动评估方法。

Method: 提出了Geometry-Aware Classification Layer（GACL），一种无需特定质量标注的通用方法，通过将特征幅度和质量度量作为双重任务进行优化。

Result: 通过大规模人类研究验证了GACL诱导的度量与人类质量感知的一致性，并展示了其在三种实际应用中的能力。

Conclusion: GACL作为一种通用数据重加权策略，不仅适用于草图质量评估，还能扩展到自然图像质量评估（IQA）和其他垂直问题，如噪声标签清洗。

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly
available at github.com/yanglan0225/SketchX-Quantifying-Sketch-Quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临小样本、特征细微及数据隐私问题，现有方法在跨场景识别和隐私保护方面研究不足。

Method: 采用DPK-GAT网络结合心理学先验和统计AU模式，进行从区域到全局的面部运动特征分层学习，并利用联邦学习框架在不共享数据的情况下提升多客户端识别能力。

Result: 在常用微表情数据库上的大量实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的FED-PsyAU研究框架通过结合心理学先验和联邦学习，有效提升了微表情识别的性能，同时解决了数据隐私和小样本问题。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: LSFDNet算法通过特征交互和多级交叉融合模块，在复杂场景下实现了卓越的船舶检测性能，并生成了视觉上令人印象深刻的融合图像。

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

Motivation: MRI切片的空间序列排列蕴含宝贵信息，但现有模型未充分利用这一特性，导致分割连续性和准确性不足。

Method: 提出M-Net框架，引入Mesh-Cast机制和Two-Phase Sequential（TPS）训练策略，结合时序建模技术处理MRI切片的空间相关性。

Result: 在BraTS2019和BraTS2023数据集上，M-Net在所有关键指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-Net通过Mesh-Cast机制和TPS训练策略，在MRI肿瘤分割任务中表现出色，优于现有方法，成为时序感知分割的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如MSE-based、GAN-based和diffusion-based方法）在图像恢复质量、保真度和速度之间难以取得平衡。

Method: HYPIR方法首先用预训练的扩散模型初始化图像恢复模型，然后通过对抗训练进行微调，避免了扩散损失、迭代采样或额外适配器的依赖。

Conclusion: HYPIR方法通过结合预训练扩散模型和对抗训练，显著提升了图像恢复的质量、保真度和速度，同时支持丰富的用户控制功能，如文本引导恢复和可调纹理丰富度。

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

Abstract: Accurate detection of defects such as hotspots and snail trails in
photovoltaic modules is essential for maintaining energy efficiency and system
reliablility. This work presents a supervised deep learning framework for
segmenting thermal infrared images of PV panels, using a dataset of 277 aerial
thermographic images captured by zenmuse XT infrared camera mounted on a DJI
Matrice 100 drone. The preprocessing pipeline includes image resizing, CLAHE
based contrast enhancement, denoising, and normalisation. A lightweight
semantic segmentation model based on SegFormer is developed, featuring a
customised Transformwer encoder and streamlined decoder, and fine-tuned on
annotated images with manually labeled defect regions. To evaluate performance,
we benchmark our model against U-Net, DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and Mask2Former using
consistent preprocessing and augmentation. Evaluation metrices includes
per-class Dice score, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, mean IoU, and pixel accuracy.
The SegFormer-based model outperforms baselines in accuracy and efficiency,

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种利用最小场景信息估计部分校准相机在平面上方滚动和俯仰方向的方法，适用于全校准不切实际的场景，为受限环境中的多相机系统提供了轻量级替代方案。

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

Conclusion: 提出的风格感知混合和基于原型的交叉对比一致性学习框架有效解决了现有弱-强一致性学习策略中的关键缺陷，并在多个医学分割基准测试中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

Conclusion: 提出的ICF框架通过MIT和SC方法有效解决了视听分割中的模态表示差异和不平衡问题，CDCL进一步提升了模型性能，实验证明了其在三个公开数据集上的最优表现。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在深度视觉推理中的瓶颈在于对精心策划的图像-文本监督的依赖，RRVF旨在通过仅使用原始图像来学习复杂视觉推理，解决这一问题。

Method: RRVF框架基于“验证不对称性”原则，通过强化学习训练优化，包含推理、渲染和视觉反馈的闭环迭代过程，并利用GRPO算法进行端到端优化。

Conclusion: 通过RRVF框架，研究表明仅依赖视觉反馈的系统可以显著提升MLLMs的深度视觉推理能力，减少对图像-文本监督的依赖，为更鲁棒和泛化的推理模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent 不仅在多模态和多平台数据的视觉理解和复杂分析任务中表现出色，还展示了跨平台和感知模态的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and
75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS-based SLAM方法依赖3D高斯椭球体，效率较低，$S^3$LAM通过2D surfel splatting提升场景表示效率和几何重建质量。

Method: 利用2D Gaussian surfels作为基元，提出自适应表面渲染策略，并从2D surfel splatting公式中推导相机位姿Jacobians。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了$S^3$LAM的高性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: $S^3$LAM 通过2D surfel splatting实现了高精度的几何表示，在合成和真实数据集上展现了最先进的性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对象中心表示的视频合成框架，通过结合扩散模型实现了高质量、时间一致的视频生成和编辑，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对象中心方法要么缺乏生成能力，要么将视频序列视为整体而忽略显式对象级结构，因此需要一种能够显式捕捉时间动态并支持生成和编辑的方法。

Method: 该方法通过学习姿态不变的对象中心槽（object-centric slots）并将其与预训练扩散模型结合，实现了像素级的高质量视频合成，同时支持对象插入、删除或替换等编辑操作。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频生成质量和时间一致性上设定了新基准，超过了以往的对象中心生成方法，并在分割性能上与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的视频合成框架，通过结合时间一致的对象中心表示与预训练扩散模型，显著提升了视频生成质量和时间一致性，同时提供了直观的编辑功能，为高级内容创作和动态场景理解开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

Motivation: 解决现有 UOD 方法依赖启发式前景先验和固定迭代次数导致的分割不足或过度问题。

Method: 提出了基于 min-cut 和集成方法的 UnionCut 前景先验，以及其高效蒸馏版本 UnionSeg。

Result: 实验表明，结合 UnionCut 或 UnionSeg 后，现有 UOD 方法在单对象发现、显著性检测和自监督实例分割任务中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: UnionCut 和 UnionSeg 显著提升了现有无监督对象发现（UOD）方法的性能，解决了前景与背景区分及对象数量不确定性的问题。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1通过其混合思维框架和主动感知机制，在自动驾驶领域实现了高效且可靠的决策，为更安全、更智能的自动驾驶系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

Motivation: 非手动面部特征在手语交流中起关键作用，但在自动手语识别中其重要性尚未充分探索。现有研究多依赖手工特征提取，且未深入比较手动特征与手动加面部特征的组合效果。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（基于CNN和基于Transformer的模型）在随机选择的孤立手语数据集上，系统评估了不同面部区域（眼睛、嘴部和全脸）的贡献。通过定量性能分析和定性显著图评估。

Result: 嘴部是最重要的非手动面部特征，能显著提高识别准确率。

Conclusion: 非手动面部特征（尤其是嘴部）在自动手语识别（ASLR）中至关重要，显著提高了识别准确性。研究强调了在ASLR中纳入面部特征的必要性。

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在Img2LaTeX任务中表现不佳，尤其是在细粒度视觉元素处理上存在不足。

Method: 提出$A^2R^2$框架，结合注意力定位和迭代细化，使视觉语言模型（VLMs）能够自我修正并逐步提高预测质量。

Result: $A^2R^2$在六个评估指标上显著优于基线方法，增加推理轮次可进一步提升性能，消融实验和人工评估验证了其核心组件的协同作用。

Conclusion: 论文提出的$A^2R^2$框架通过注意力引导的迭代细化，显著提升了Img2LaTeX任务的性能，并在多个评估指标和实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

Motivation: 传统图像去雪方法存在幻觉伪影和帧率依赖问题，事件相机因其低延迟和高动态范围成为理想解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于事件相机的去雪方法，利用雪花的时空特征设计注意力模块，恢复被遮挡的背景点。

Conclusion: 本研究通过事件相机技术显著提升了图像去雪效果，为恶劣天气条件下的视觉系统可靠性和安全性提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

Motivation: 低空无人机（LAD）场景中的RIS研究不足，现有方法难以处理LAD视角的多样性和高密度对象特性。

Method: 提出了Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network（SAARN），通过Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement（CDLE）和Adaptive Reasoning Fusion Module（ARFM）动态路由语义信息，优化复杂场景中的推理。

Result: 实验表明RIS-LAD对现有RIS算法构成挑战，SAARN模型能有效解决这些挑战。

Conclusion: RIS-LAD数据集和SAARN模型为低空无人机场景中的Referring Image Segmentation（RIS）提供了新的基准和解决方案，填补了现有研究和数据集的空白。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

Motivation: 解决QBE检索需要样本查询文档的局限性，ABDIR提供了基于视觉属性的灵活检索方式，但如何结合两者优势是关键。

Method: 提出T2I-QBE方法，利用Leonardo.Ai作为文本到图像生成器，结合ABDIR风格的属性提示生成查询图像，再通过传统的QBE范式进行检索。

Result: 在HisIR19历史文档数据集上的实验证实了T2I-QBE的可行性。

Conclusion: T2I-QBE是一种可行的历史文档图像检索方法，首次尝试利用文本到图像生成技术于文档图像检索领域。

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside

TL;DR: GTAD网络通过聚合全局时间信息，提升了动态环境感知的准确性和全面性，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用全局序列信息，主要依赖相邻帧的局部时间交互，限制了动态环境感知的准确性。

Method: 提出了一种名为GTAD的全局时间聚合去噪网络，结合当前时刻的局部时间特征和历史序列的全局时间特征。

Result: 在nuScenes和Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试及消融研究中，GTAD方法表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: GTAD网络通过整合局部和全局时间信息，提供了更连贯和全面的环境理解，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Conclusion: 提出的生成式数据增强方法有效缓解了域偏移问题，并发布了新西兰和犹他州的新标注数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锚点聚类方法通常以启发式或任务无关的方式设计，忽略了核心优化原则。

Method: 提出LargeMvC-Net，将锚点聚类过程分解为RepresentModule、NoiseModule和AnchorModule三个模块，分别对应表示学习、噪声抑制和锚点指示器估计。

Result: 在多个大规模多视图基准测试中，LargeMvC-Net在效果和可扩展性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net通过模块化设计和优化过程展开，显著提升了大规模多视图聚类的效果和可扩展性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多教师对抗性知识蒸馏方法，通过自适应学习策略提升CNN模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对抗训练取得了进展，但模型准确性和鲁棒性之间仍存在差距。为了解决这一问题，提出了多教师对抗性知识蒸馏方法。

Method: 首先训练多个基线CNN模型的克隆，使用对抗训练策略在不同对抗攻击生成的扰动数据上进行训练；然后利用这些对抗训练的模型作为教师模型，通过多教师知识蒸馏指导学生在干净数据上的学习；设计自适应学习策略，根据各教师模型的预测精度分配权重，控制其知识贡献。

Result: 在MNIST-Digits和Fashion-MNIST数据集上的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性，显著提升了CNN模型对抗各种对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过多教师对抗性知识蒸馏和自适应学习策略，显著提升了CNN模型对抗各种对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: EmoCapCLIP 利用自然语言描述作为监督信号，通过对比学习框架提升面部情绪识别性能，并在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部情绪识别系统受限于固定的标签或维度，无法捕捉情绪的丰富性和细微差别。自然语言提供更灵活、表达力强的监督方式，但缺乏大规模数据集和有效框架。

Method: 提出了 EmoCapCLIP，结合全局-局部对比学习框架和跨模态引导的正样本挖掘模块，以充分利用多层次的描述信息。

Result: 在超过 20 个基准测试中表现出色，验证了从大规模语义丰富的描述中学习面部情绪表示的有效性。

Conclusion: EmoCapCLIP 方法通过利用大规模语义丰富的自然语言描述作为监督信号，显著提升了面部情绪识别的性能，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all
publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M，一个公开的大规模图像编辑数据集，通过优化现有数据集生成，微调后的模型表现优异，推动开源研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型（如GPT-4o）的专有性质及其训练数据为开源研究设置了障碍，因此需要一种公开可用的大规模图像编辑数据集。

Method: 通过利用GPT-4o的能力统一和优化三个流行的图像编辑数据集（OmniEdit、HQ-Edit和UltraEdit），包括1）重新生成输出图像以提升视觉质量和指令对齐，2）选择性重写提示以提高语义清晰度。

Result: 在GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M上微调的FluxKontext模型在多个基准测试中表现优异（如GEdit-EN得分为7.24，ImgEdit-Full为3.80，Complex-Edit为8.78），显著超越现有开源方法并缩小与专有模型的差距。

Conclusion: GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M的发布有望推动开放研究在指令引导图像编辑领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

Result: 提出了一个分层框架，将4D空间智能分为五个层次，并分析了每层的挑战和前景。

Conclusion: 该论文总结了4D空间智能重建领域的关键挑战，并提出了未来发展的方向。

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date
project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.

Abstract: Cloud computing enables the dynamic provisioning of server resources. To
exploit this opportunity, a policy is needed for dynamically allocating (and
deallocating) servers in response to the current load conditions. In this paper
we describe several simple policies for dynamic server allocation and develop
analytic models for their analysis. We also design semi-Markov decision models
that enable determination of the performance achieved with optimal policies,
allowing us to quantify the performance gap between simple, easily implemented
policies, and optimal policies. Finally, we apply our models to study the
potential performance benefits of state-dependent routing in multi-site systems
when using dynamic server allocation at each site. Insights from our results
are valuable to service providers wanting to balance cloud service costs and
delays.

Conclusion: Oranits 系统模型在动态智能交通系统（ITS）环境中实现了更快、更自适应且更高效的任务处理，显著提升了任务完成数量和整体效益。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open
Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS),
where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient
processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies
between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge
servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission
dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle
cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach.
First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm,
namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline
for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double
Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and
multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment
time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations
reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall
benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN
achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and
12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the
effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient
task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

Motivation: 矩阵乘法是科学计算和机器学习的基础操作，但其计算复杂性成为大规模应用的瓶颈。并行架构（多核CPU和GPU）是当前主流解决方案，本文旨在量化分析其在消费级硬件上的性能表现。

Method: 实现了三种矩阵乘法算法：基线顺序C++实现、基于OpenMP的多核CPU并行版本，以及基于CUDA并利用共享内存优化的GPU并行版本。对128x128至4096x4096的方阵进行了性能评估。

Result: 并行CPU版本相比顺序版本实现了12-14倍的加速；GPU版本性能随问题规模显著提升，4096x4096矩阵下达到593倍（相比顺序版本）和45倍（相比并行CPU版本）的加速。

Conclusion: 本文通过实证分析展示了现代异构平台（多核CPU和GPU）对矩阵乘法性能的显著提升，尤其是在大规模问题上，GPU的加速效果尤为突出。

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a foundational operation in scientific computing and
machine learning, yet its computational complexity makes it a significant
bottleneck for large-scale applications. The shift to parallel architectures,
primarily multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs, is the established solution, and
these systems are now ubiquitous from datacenters to consumer laptops. This
paper presents a direct, empirical performance analysis of matrix
multiplication on a modern, consumer-grade heterogeneous platform. We
implemented and benchmarked three versions of the algorithm: a baseline
sequential C++ implementation, a parallel version for its multi-core CPU using
OpenMP, and a massively parallel version for its discrete GPU using CUDA with
shared memory optimizations. The implementations were evaluated with square
matrices of varying dimensions, from 128x128 to 4096x4096. Our results show
that while the parallel CPU provides a consistent speedup of 12-14x over the
sequential version, the GPU's performance scales dramatically with problem
size. For a 4096x4096 matrix, the GPU implementation achieved a speedup of
approximately 593x over the sequential baseline and 45x over the optimized
parallel CPU version. These findings quantitatively demonstrate the profound
impact of many-core GPU architectures on accelerating data-parallel workloads,
underscoring that significant performance gains are readily accessible even on
consumer-level hardware.

Abstract: The rapid escalation in the parameter count of large language models (LLMs)
has transformed model training from a single-node endeavor into a highly
intricate, cross-node activity. While frameworks such as Megatron-LM
successfully integrate tensor (TP), pipeline (PP), and data (DP) parallelism to

unprecedented systems-level challenges in performance optimization, diagnosis,

designed to meet these challenges. It introduces four orthogonal, yet
seamlessly composable modules--MegaScan, MegaFBD, MegaDPP, and MegaScope--that
collectively elevate the reliability, efficiency, and transparency of
production-scale training. This paper presents the motivation, architecture,
and distinctive contributions of each module, and elucidates how their
synergistic integration augments the Megatron-LM ecosystem.

### [176] [A Fast Parallel Median Filtering Algorithm Using Hierarchical Tiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19926)
*Louis Sugy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于分层平铺的新型中值滤波算法，包括数据无关和数据感知两种变体，显著提升了计算效率，CUDA实现比现有技术快5倍，成为多种数据类型和内核尺寸下最快的滤波器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Median filtering is widely used for noise removal in digital images but suffers from high computational costs, especially for large kernels. Existing methods either scale poorly (sorting-based) or have high constant factors (constant-time methods). The motivation is to develop a more efficient algorithm that addresses these limitations.

Method: The paper proposes a novel algorithm that utilizes hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations. It introduces two variants: a data-oblivious selection network operating within registers and a data-aware version using random-access memory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$, respectively.

Result: The CUDA implementation of the proposed algorithm is up to 5 times faster than the current state-of-the-art on modern GPUs, making it the fastest median filter for 8-, 16-, and 32-bit data types and kernel sizes from $3 \times 3$ to $75 \times 75$.

Conclusion: The novel algorithm introduced in this paper, which leverages hierarchical tiling and offers two variants (data-oblivious and data-aware), significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, making it the fastest median filter for various data types and kernel sizes.

Abstract: Median filtering is a non-linear smoothing technique widely used in digital
image processing to remove noise while retaining sharp edges. It is
particularly well suited to removing outliers (impulse noise) or granular
artifacts (speckle noise). However, the high computational cost of median
filtering can be prohibitive. Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels
but scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time
methods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such
as histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the
sorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations.
We propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate
entirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access
memory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$,
respectively, for a $k \times k$ kernel - unprecedented for sorting-based
methods. Our CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than the current state
of the art on a modern GPU and is the fastest median filter in most cases for

*David Jannis Schmidt,Grigory Fridman,Florian von Zabiensky*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于云的可扩展架构，用于实时系统的软件追踪，通过将工作负载转移到云端，实现了高效的大规模分析和长期监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的追踪工具依赖本地桌面，处理和存储能力有限，难以进行大规模分析。本文旨在解决这一问题，实现实时系统的高效追踪和分析。

Method: 提出了一种基于微服务和边缘计算的可扩展云架构，用于实时系统中的软件追踪。该方法将追踪处理工作负载从开发者的机器转移到云端，使用专用追踪组件捕获跟踪数据，并通过WebSockets和Apache Kafka将其转发到可扩展的后端。

Conclusion: 该架构虽然在高系统负载下每会话吞吐量略有下降，但整体吞吐量增加，能够高效处理多个并行追踪会话，适用于开发中和现场运行时的监控。

Abstract: Real-time embedded systems require precise timing and fault detection to
ensure correct behavior. Traditional tracing tools often rely on local desktops
with limited processing and storage capabilities, which hampers large-scale
analysis. This paper presents a scalable, cloud-based architecture for software
tracing in real-time systems based on microservices and edge computing. Our
approach shifts the trace processing workload from the developer's machine to
the cloud, using a dedicated tracing component that captures trace data and
forwards it to a scalable backend via WebSockets and Apache Kafka. This enables
long-term monitoring and collaborative analysis of target executions, e.g., to
detect and investigate sporadic errors. We demonstrate how this architecture
supports scalable analysis of parallel tracing sessions and lays the foundation
for future integration of rule-based testing and runtime verification. The
evaluation results show that the architecture can handle many parallel tracing
sessions efficiently, although the per-session throughput decreases slightly as
the system load increases, while the overall throughput increases. Although the
design includes a dedicated tracer for analysis during development, this
approach is not limited to such setups. Target systems with network
connectivity can stream reduced trace data directly, enabling runtime
monitoring in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有并发集合实现在读取密集型场景下表现优异，但在更新密集型或需要原子范围查询时性能不佳。

Method: 利用并发(a,b)-树实现MTASet，专为处理更新密集型工作负载和原子范围查询设计。

Result: MTASet在范围查询操作中性能提升高达2倍，并保持线性一致性。

Conclusion: MTASet作为一种新型并发集合结构，在更新密集型工作负载和原子范围查询方面表现出色，显著优于现有优化方案，并确保线性一致性。

Abstract: In concurrent data structures, the efficiency of set operations can vary
significantly depending on the workload characteristics. Numerous concurrent
set implementations are optimized and fine-tuned to excel in scenarios
characterized by predominant read operations. However, they often perform
poorly when confronted with workloads that heavily prioritize updates.
Additionally, current leading-edge concurrent sets optimized for update-heavy
tasks typically lack efficiency in handling atomic range queries. This study
introduces the MTASet, which leverages a concurrent (a,b)-tree implementation.
Engineered to accommodate update-heavy workloads and facilitate atomic range
queries, MTASet surpasses existing counterparts optimized for tasks in range
query operations by up to 2x. Notably, MTASet ensures linearizability.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文通过实证测量发现，消费级笔记本电脑中的离散GPU在性能和能源效率上均大幅领先于CPU和集成GPU，为能源感知软件开发提供了量化指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于单核处理器的基本功率和热限制，多核和异构计算范式转变使得能源效率成为高性能计算（HPC）的首要设计约束。量化这些性能和功率之间的权衡在广泛可访问的硬件上仍是一个关键研究领域。

Method: 使用标准、经过验证且侵入性最小的工具（如Linux perf和nvidia-smi），对三种不同计算架构（多核AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU、离散NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU和集成AMD Radeon Vega GPU）进行直接、实证的测量，评估其性能和能源效率。

Result: 离散GPU在性能（93.5倍速度提升）和能源效率（仅消耗CPU的2%能量）方面均表现最佳，能效提升达50倍。

Conclusion: 研究发现，在消费级笔记本电脑中，离散GPU不仅是性能的领先者（比CPU快93.5倍），同时也是能效最高的选择（仅消耗CPU的2%能量），能效提升达50倍。这为‘快速空闲’原则提供了实际验证，并为能源感知软件开发提供了明确的量化指导。

Abstract: The paradigm shift towards multi-core and heterogeneous computing, driven by
the fundamental power and thermal limits of single-core processors, has
established energy efficiency as a first-class design constraint in
high-performance computing (HPC). Heterogeneous systems, integrating
traditional multi-core CPUs with specialized accelerators like discrete (dGPU)
and integrated (iGPU) graphics processing units, offer a compelling path to
navigating the trade-offs between performance and power. However, quantifying
these trade-offs on widely accessible hardware remains a critical area of
study. This paper presents a direct, empirical measurement of the performance
and energy-to-solution of a canonical HPC workload -- a 4096x4096 matrix-matrix
multiplication -- on three distinct compute architectures within a single
consumer-grade laptop: a multi-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, a discrete NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, and an integrated AMD Radeon Vega GPU. Using standard,
validated, and minimally intrusive tools such as Linux perf and nvidia-smi, we
find that the discrete GPU is not only the performance leader, achieving a
93.5x speedup over the CPU, but is also the most energy-efficient, consuming
only 2% of the energy used by the CPU, resulting in a 50-fold improvement in
energy efficiency. These findings provide a practical demonstration of the
"race to idle" principle and offer clear, quantitative guidance on
architectural choices for energy-aware software development.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance
parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the
Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the
increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex,
large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for
optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm,
inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for
parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This
study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP
framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts,
scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and
strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to
rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer
insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable
references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking
forward, other factors, such as cache behavior and thread scheduling strategies
at micro and macro levels, hold potential for further exploration and
optimization.

Abstract: Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform, has revolutionized the digital
economy by enabling decentralized transactions and the execution of smart
contracts. Ethereum transactions form the backbone of its network, facilitating
peer-to-peer exchanges and interactions with complex decentralized
applications. Smart contracts extend Ethereum's capabilities by automating
processes and enabling trustless execution of agreements. Hence, understanding
how these smart contracts interact is important in order to facilitate various
performance optimizations, such as warming objects before they are being
accessed and enabling concurrent execution. Of particular interest to us are
the development of the calling graph, as well as the read sets and write sets
of invocations within the same block, and the properties of the associated
conflict graph that is derived from them. The latter is important for
understanding the parallelization potential of smart contracts on Ethereum. We
traced upwards of 2 million recent Ethereum blocks using call tracer and
prestate tracer, out of a total of 21.4 million blocks at the time of writing.
We report on the transactions per block distribution, the structure of call
trees in smart contract invocations, the ratio of value-transfer transactions
to smart contract invocations, as well as provide a comprehensive study of the
structure of blocks' conflict graphs. We find that conflict graphs
predominantly show a star like configuration, as well as other noteworthy
structural properties.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了首个在非公平调度器下保证选举出唯一领导者的自稳定算法，适用于可编程物质系统，通过粒子运动和共同方向感知克服了传统限制。

Abstract: Leader election is a fundamental problem in distributed computing,
particularly within programmable matter systems, where coordination among
simple computational entities is crucial for solving complex tasks. In these
systems, particles (i.e., constant memory computational entities) operate in a
regular triangular grid as described in the geometric Amoebot model. While
leader election has been extensively studied in non self-stabilising settings,
self-stabilising solutions remain more limited. In this work, we study the
problem of self-stabilising leader election in connected (but not necessarily
simply connected) configurations. We present the first self-stabilising
algorithm for programmable matter that guarantees the election of a unique
leader under an unfair scheduler, assuming particles share a common sense of
direction. Our approach leverages particle movement, a capability not
previously exploited in the self-stabilising context. We show that movement in
conjunction with particles operating in a grid can overcome classical
impossibility results for constant-memory systems established by Dolev et al.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代高性能计算系统提供高度并行性和异构性，需要有效的调度和负载平衡技术以实现良好性能。

Method: 提出了基于专家和强化学习（RL）的方法，并在六个应用和三个系统上进行了详细的性能分析。

Result: RL方法能够学习高性能调度决策，但需要大量探索；专家方法依赖先验知识，探索较少，但可能无法找到最优算法。结合专家知识与RL学习可提升性能和适应性。

Conclusion: 动态选择调度算法在OpenMP应用中既可行又有益，该方法还可扩展至基于MPI的程序，实现多级并行调度决策的优化。

Abstract: Scientific and data science applications are becoming increasingly complex,
with growing computational and memory demands. Modern high performance
computing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across
nodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling
and load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks
such as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support
diverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling
algorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable
algorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.
  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling
algorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement
learning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across
six applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are
capable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require
significant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.
Expert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less
exploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a
specific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based
learning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.
  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling
algorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP
applications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling
optimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构系统中多样化的计算架构和动态任务映射使得高效内存管理变得复杂，现有方法通常需要程序员显式管理数据放置和传输，或假设静态映射限制了可移植性和可扩展性。

Method: RIMMS 是一个轻量级、硬件无关的内存抽象层，透明地跟踪数据位置、管理一致性，并支持跨异构计算元素的高效内存分配。

Result: RIMMS 在 CPU+GPU 和 CPU+FPGA 平台上分别实现了高达 2.43 倍和 1.82 倍的加速，相比于 IRIS 系统，速度提升高达 3.08 倍，并且与原生 CUDA 实现性能相当。

Conclusion: RIMMS 是一种高效的运行时内存管理系统，能够在异构计算环境中提供高性能和编程效率，同时保持低开销。

Abstract: Efficient memory management in heterogeneous systems is increasingly
challenging due to diverse compute architectures (e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA) and
dynamic task mappings not known at compile time. Existing approaches often
require programmers to manage data placement and transfers explicitly, or
assume static mappings that limit portability and scalability. This paper
introduces RIMMS (Runtime Integrated Memory Management System), a lightweight,
runtime-managed, hardware-agnostic memory abstraction layer that decouples
application development from low-level memory operations. RIMMS transparently
tracks data locations, manages consistency, and supports efficient memory
allocation across heterogeneous compute elements without requiring
platform-specific tuning or code modifications. We integrate RIMMS into a
baseline runtime and evaluate with complete radar signal processing
applications across CPU+GPU and CPU+FPGA platforms. RIMMS delivers up to 2.43X
speedup on GPU-based and 1.82X on FPGA-based systems over the baseline.
Compared to IRIS, a recent heterogeneous runtime system, RIMMS achieves up to
3.08X speedup and matches the performance of native CUDA implementations while
significantly reducing programming complexity. Despite operating at a higher
abstraction level, RIMMS incurs only 1-2 cycles of overhead per memory
management call, making it a low-cost solution. These results demonstrate
RIMMS's ability to deliver high performance and enhanced programmer
productivity in dynamic, real-world heterogeneous environments.

Motivation: 解决CT图像中肺部结节二元分类的挑战，特别是针对放射科医生意见分歧较大的复杂病例，旨在提供一种自动化辅助工具以提高诊断准确性和效率。

Method: 使用三种预训练骨干网络（EfficientNet V2 S、MobileViT XXS和DenseNet201），并为其定制分类头以适应96 x 96像素输入。采用两阶段注意力机制学习模型和类别重要性分数，并通过轻量级元学习器优化最终预测。为缓解类别不平衡和提高泛化能力，使用了动态焦点损失、MixUp增强和测试时增强。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI数据集上实现了98.09%的准确率和0.9961的AUC，相比现有技术错误率降低了35%。模型在敏感度（98.73%）和特异性（98.96%）上表现平衡，尤其在放射科医生意见分歧高的病例中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种多级注意力堆叠集成深度神经网络方法，用于CT图像的肺部结节二元分类（良性 vs 恶性），在LIDC-IDRI数据集上表现出卓越性能，可作为放射科医生在肺癌筛查中的自动化辅助工具。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Result: 在银行、航班和医疗三个领域的五种用户意图测试中，WARPP在参数保真度、工具准确性和平均token使用量上均优于非个性化方法和ReAct基线。

Conclusion: WARPP框架通过运行时并行个性化显著提升了基于LLM的任务导向对话系统在复杂工作流中的表现，无需额外训练即可实现更高的参数保真度和工具准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented
dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that
involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present
Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a
training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with
runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By
dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the
framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime.
WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent
operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor
execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five
representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:
banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets
and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional
dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the
non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger
gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while
also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

Conclusion: 本文综述了超博弈理论在动态多智能体环境中的应用，提出了新的研究路线图，以增强战略建模的现实性和有效性。

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete
information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often
violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned
perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers
have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,
subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory
extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective
perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which
agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available
actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of
hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted
to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from
cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general
game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory
and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop
agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to
assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals
prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based
models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical
frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including
the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame
languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and
agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research
directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to
enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic
multi-agent environments.

<details>

Motivation: 解决边缘设备上部署大型语言模型（LLMs）时因序列长度导致的二次计算增长问题。

Method: DeltaLLM通过时间稀疏性利用和上下文感知混合注意力机制，结合局部上下文窗口内的完整注意力与外部窗口的Delta近似，提高效率。

Result: 在BitNet和Llama模型上，DeltaLLM在预填充和解码阶段分别实现了高达60%和57%的注意力稀疏性，且准确率略有提升或几乎无下降。

Conclusion: DeltaLLM提供了一个无需微调的高效边缘部署方案，能够无缝集成到现有推理流程中。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

Conclusion: 本调查总结了LLM对齐领域的开放问题，包括监督、价值多元性、鲁棒性和持续对齐，旨在为研究者和实践者提供参考。

Abstract: Due to the remarkable capabilities and growing impact of large language
models (LLMs), they have been deeply integrated into many aspects of society.
Thus, ensuring their alignment with human values and intentions has emerged as
a critical challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
practical alignment techniques, training protocols, and empirical findings in
LLM alignment. We analyze the development of alignment methods across diverse
paradigms, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between core alignment
objectives. Our analysis shows that while supervised fine-tuning enables basic
instruction-following, preference-based methods offer more flexibility for
aligning with nuanced human intent. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques,
including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI,
brain-inspired methods, and alignment uncertainty quantification (AUQ),
highlighting their approaches to balancing quality and efficiency. We review
existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarking datasets, emphasizing
limitations such as reward misspecification, distributional robustness, and
scalable oversight. We summarize strategies adopted by leading AI labs to
illustrate the current state of practice. We conclude by outlining open
problems in oversight, value pluralism, robustness, and continuous alignment.
This survey aims to inform both researchers and practitioners navigating the
evolving landscape of LLM alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs性能扩展定律如何限制其预测不确定性的改进，揭示其可能导致的退化AI行为。

Method: 分析了LLMs的扩展定律及其对预测不确定性的影响，探讨了非高斯输出分布与误差累积的关系。

Result: LLMs的扩展定律严重限制了其预测不确定性的改进，可能导致误差累积和信息灾难。

Conclusion: 避免LLMs退化AI路径需要在研究问题时更重视对问题结构特性的洞察和理解。

Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large
language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty
of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the
standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We
argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs,
namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian
input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error
pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This
tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism
underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is
substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by
Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of
its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is
a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must
inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also
discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight
and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being
investigated.

TL;DR: 研究评估了三种IM方法对RL代理行为的影响，发现IM会改变行为且GRM能部分缓解奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于游戏中的奖励稀疏性，以及内在激励（IM）方法可能导致的奖励黑客问题，本研究旨在探索IM奖励对RL代理行为的具体影响。

Method: 本研究通过实证评估三种IM技术在MiniGrid游戏环境中的行为影响，并与广义奖励匹配（GRM）方法进行比较。

Result: IM方法显著改变了代理的行为，包括提高初始奖励和改变游戏方式；GRM在部分场景中缓解了奖励黑客问题。

Conclusion: 研究表明，内在激励（IM）方法确实会改变强化学习（RL）代理的行为，包括提高初始奖励和改变游戏方式。广义奖励匹配（GRM）在某些情况下能有效缓解奖励黑客问题。

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their
reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of
deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce
exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However,
IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for
the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem
is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to
whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This
study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of
three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM
models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with
any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that
IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also
altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some
scenarios.

TL;DR: HypKG框架整合EHRs到KGs中，通过超图模型和变换器提升医疗预测准确性，并增强知识实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用知识图谱缺乏对患者特定状态的上下文考虑，而EHRs提供了丰富的个人数据，为知识图谱提供了自然上下文，这对精准医疗至关重要。

Method: 提出HypKG框架，结合先进的实体链接技术和超图模型，利用下游预测任务指导的超图变换器，联合学习KGs和患者的上下文表示。

Result: 在大型生物医学知识图谱和两个真实世界EHR数据集上的实验表明，HypKG在多项评估指标上显著提升了医疗预测任务的性能。

Conclusion: HypKG通过整合电子健康记录（EHRs）到知识图谱（KGs）中，显著提升了医疗预测任务的准确性，并增强了知识的现实适用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are
widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains
where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge
accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing
general factual information often lack the ability to account for important
contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are
crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)
provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which
provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a
framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate
contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.
Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from
general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph
model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,
we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to
jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,
fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In
experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG
demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across
multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,
HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,
potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

Method: 利用基本形式本体论（BFO）和公共核心本体论（CCO）提供的语义框架，将数据（如渔船移动）组织到知识图谱中并进行检索。查询结果用于创建马尔可夫链模型，以基于历史数据预测未来状态。

Result: 通过马尔可夫链模型成功预测了基于渔船历史的未来状态，并将概率计算集成回知识图谱，支持进一步分析。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于本体结构知识图谱的预测方法，通过引入‘时空瞬间’概念完善结构语义，并提出了关于概率的新观点，将概率视为过程轮廓，以更好地捕捉现实世界现象的动力学。最后，展示了如何将基于马尔可夫链的概率计算无缝集成回知识图谱中，以支持进一步分析和决策。

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in
generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic
framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies
(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be
organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then
used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based
on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term
`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.
Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,
which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic
concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an
alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process
profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,
we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be
seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis
and decision-making. Keywords: predictive analytics, ontology, Markov chains,
probability, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), knowledge graphs, SPARQL.

TL;DR: ASPBench基准测试揭示了LLMs在复杂ASP任务（如答案集计算）上的局限性，呼吁更有效的符号推理整合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM在ASP中能力的评估有限，缺乏专门设计的任务和复杂ASP程序的支持。

Method: 引入了ASPBench，一个全面的ASP基准测试，包含三个特定任务：ASP蕴含、答案集验证和答案集计算。

Result: 14个最先进的LLMs在前两个简单任务上表现较好，但在核心的答案集计算任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在ASP核心任务（如答案集计算）上表现不足，突显了需要更有效整合符号推理能力的新方法。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic
reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations
of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ
overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or
multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce
tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:
ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our
extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,
including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and
\emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two
simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of
ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs
in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate
symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 开发一个能够处理非平稳市场的通用供应链优化模型，以解决现实世界中的复杂供应链问题，同时兼顾经济、环境和社会目标。

Method: 基于马尔可夫决策过程的多目标、多层次供应链优化模型，结合经济、环境和社会因素，采用多目标强化学习方法进行评价，并与修改后的单目标强化学习和多目标进化算法方法进行对比。

Result: 主要方法在复杂设置下比基于多目标进化算法的方法高出75%的超体积，生成的解密度约为修改后单目标强化学习方法的11倍，表现出更好的鲁棒性，同时确保稳定的生产和库存水平，最小化需求损失。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多目标强化学习方法在供应链优化中表现出色，能够在复杂网络设置下实现最优性、多样性和密度的最佳平衡，显著优于基于多目标进化算法和修改后的单目标强化学习方法。

Abstract: This study develops a generalised multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain
optimisation model with non-stationary markets based on a Markov decision
process, incorporating economic, environmental, and social considerations. The
model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,
benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with
weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network
complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable
simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across
supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing
objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the
primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,
diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that
allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up
to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions
that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than
those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures
stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

TL;DR: DiCap是一种基于扩散的反事实提示学习框架，通过理论驱动的方法生成因果不变提示，提升跨类别泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法因理论不足，难以实现因果不变提示，导致无法捕获跨类别稳健特征。

Method: 利用扩散过程从因果模型的边际和条件分布中迭代采样梯度，生成反事实提示，并结合对比学习框架优化提示提取。

Result: 在图像分类、图文检索和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，尤其在未见类别上具有显著优势。

Conclusion: DiCap模型通过扩散过程和对比学习框架，成功生成了满足最小充分性准则的反事实提示，显著提升了在未见类别上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional
model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by
inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving
causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust
features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these
challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically
grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual
$\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to
iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of
the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the
minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations,
this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while
imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive
learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby
enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the
causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification,
image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong
advantages in unseen categories.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI与人类认知的不可分割性，提出通过分析技术对认知的影响（位移、增强、替代）来真正实现以人为中心的AI设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨以人为中心的人工智能（AI）如何真正关注人类行为和体验，避免将AI视为独立于人类认知的存在。

Method: 通过新颖的定义和分析，将社会技术关系分为不同类型：对人类认知劳动的位移（有害）、增强（有益）和/或替代（中性）。

Result: 通过对比技术（如算盘、闹钟、相机、血汗工厂）与人类认知（如心算、敲门人、视觉、裁缝），展示了AI与人类认知的关系。

Conclusion: 所有AI都涉及人类认知，无论形式如何。在AI领域中模糊认知会导致扭曲、减缓批判性参与、歪曲认知科学，并限制我们真正以人类为中心设计AI系统的能力。要开始去神秘化AI，必须正视‘人在循环中’的角色。

Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means
centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I
argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where
it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human
cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with
cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus
knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel
definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into
varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or
replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates
human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context --
from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing
critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our
ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.
To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the
eyes.

TL;DR: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT supervision achieve GPT-4o-level accuracy in extracting PCL features from radiology reports, enabling efficient large-scale PCL research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to advance PCL research.

Method: Two open-source LLMs (LLaMA and DeepSeek) were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated CoT data to extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign risk categories. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out human-annotated reports, with model outputs reviewed by radiologists.

Result: CoT fine-tuning improved feature extraction accuracy (LLaMA: 80% to 97%; DeepSeek: 79% to 98%) and risk categorization F1 scores (LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), matching GPT-4o performance. Radiologist-model agreement was high (Fleiss' Kappa ~0.89), indicating model outputs were on par with radiologists.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的数字孪生信道（DTC）在线优化框架在6G网络中实现了高效、低开销且环境感知的资源分配，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving,
and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on
flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks.
Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective
in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state
information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these
challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework
is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental
sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic
algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient
manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial
workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements
of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its
effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication
in future 6G networks.

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational
intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined
with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and
preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual
framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing
humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the
conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large
Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to
share their different preferences through structured conversations. This
approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences
directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would
require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze
different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems
that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that
could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework
aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,
understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI
responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of
this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers
but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial
intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种考虑代理人习惯、偏好及其偏好朋友网络的方法，为稳定室友问题生成个性化解决方案，并通过实例和实证评估验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents
over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into
pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists
of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two
agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching).
Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates
problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute
"good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual
preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a
method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We
illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical
evaluations.

outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of
transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism
is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study
an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models,
which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an
intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem,
we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent
Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability
trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each
cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where
the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.
Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state
embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation
representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II
micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves
superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The
results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept
representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time
concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and
identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

Conclusion: HFrame 是一个基于图神经网络的子图同态框架，它结合了传统算法和机器学习技术，在性能和速度上都表现出色。

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their
structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem
involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that
adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph.
Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism
allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph,
making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based
framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms
with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms
standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs
where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a
generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world
and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than
exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that
leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology
scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to
solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming,
manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These
methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent
repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to
inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting
edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning,
and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and
retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured
patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically
extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These
solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical
categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across
interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform
integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions
and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight
sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D
teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability,
and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine
that reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances
decision making in complex R&D environments.

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，大型语言模型（LLMs）的高维内部表示既是安全对齐的优势也是挑战，降维处理可以在保留足够信息的同时减少被攻击的脆弱性。

Abstract: The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased
significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The
scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in
parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize
that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to
emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in
the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,
to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear
subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various
model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations
uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that
projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace
can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear
structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction
significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation
engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical
insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden
dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a
model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety
alignment.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion
planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced
interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare
and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted
perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as
fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are
essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge
this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a
learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of
reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,
detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning
capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe
trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate
(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by
dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,
thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and
computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,
challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results
demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road
conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

Conclusion: HAG-PS在动态移动资源分配中表现出色，通过分层自适应分组参数共享，显著提高了共享单车等资源的可用性。

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing
vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the
urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)
for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important
research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility
resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility
resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across
agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);
and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale
setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel
designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we
have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local
information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility
resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to
split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of
encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a
learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple
parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on
real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and
demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of
HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in
robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities
becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances
in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs
perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for
agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this
gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure
spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our
methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of
varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate
feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test
fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic
transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while
OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$,
other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100%
of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a
cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in
Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,
suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather
than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications
for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial
intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability
and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable
navigation across linguistic contexts.

small AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making processes. By
integrating model layering techniques with privacy protection measures, our
approach ensures the secure transmission of model parameters while maintaining
high efficiency in learning and reasoning capabilities. The experimental

reasoning accuracy but also effectively protects the privacy of edge nodes.
This presents a viable solution for achieving resilient large model lifelong

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming
(ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to
effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work
is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal
with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive
user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the
performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main
contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving
by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and
add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting
cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete
configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits
the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,
thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface
that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

Motivation: 传统进化方法直接操作启发式代码，而MeLA则通过进化指导LLM生成启发式的指令提示，提出了一种新的自动启发式设计（AHD）范式。

Method: MeLA采用了一种新颖的元认知框架，通过分析性能反馈来系统地优化其生成策略。该架构集成了问题分析器、错误诊断系统和元认知搜索引擎，迭代优化提示以生成更有效的启发式。

Result: 在基准和现实问题的综合实验中，MeLA生成的启发式始终更有效且稳健，显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了将认知科学作为AI架构蓝图的深远潜力，揭示了通过让LLM元认知地调节其问题解决过程，我们为自动启发式设计（AHD）开辟了一条更稳健且可解释的路径。

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that
presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional
evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA
evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in
generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a
novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to
systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a
problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis
system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that
iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In
comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA
consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates
the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI
architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its
problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱中存在过时或错误知识，需从嵌入模型中移除。现有遗忘方法存在完全遗忘困难和对剩余知识影响的问题。

Method: 通过将遗忘问题重构为偏好优化问题，利用DPO训练模型偏好重构替代而非原始遗忘三元组，同时引入边界外采样策略和边界回忆机制。

Result: 在四个流行知识图谱上的实验显示，GraphDPO在MRR_Avg和MRR_F1指标上分别提升10.1%和14.0%。

Conclusion: GraphDPO提出了一种基于直接偏好优化的新近似遗忘框架，有效解决了知识图谱中信息遗忘和保留完整性的挑战，实验结果表明其在多项指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous
knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.
To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate
specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge
in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact
unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high
training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to
KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove
targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from
remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which
weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these
issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on
direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting
triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the
model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original
forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable
knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.
Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct
preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection
between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary
knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills
relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight
unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.
Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5 7B和13B等基准数据集上的评估表明，该方法在多种压缩水平下均优于SparseGPT和Wanda等现有技术。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的自适应搜索算法通过结合剪枝和KV缓存量化，显著提升了大型多模态模型（LMMs）的效率，且无需额外微调即可保持模型精度。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating
visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning
capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains
a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm
that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency.
Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts
pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers,
using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely
combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast
pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight
adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.
Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and
13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such
as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our
framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new
standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing
much performance.

Conclusion: MoCME框架通过互补性模态知识融合和熵引导负采样机制，显著提升了多模态知识图谱补全的性能，并在五个基准数据集上实现了最先进的成果。

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to
capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the
stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive
fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional
architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding
window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction
strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short
and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to
automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships
among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require
human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce
calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global
characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing
redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a
partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly
mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which
gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct
sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained
level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the
multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the
corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with
other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the
experimental results.

Abstract: MAPF problem aims to find plans for multiple agents in an environment within

Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF
(D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the
environment or obstacles being removed/moved. Considering the requirements of
real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce
1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a
new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing
different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve
D-MAPF (combining advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with a novel
concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the
strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the
perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of
various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware
AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations
of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As
these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value
learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an
agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour.
Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more
adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of
different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value
systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value
systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep
clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of
diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative
value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a
use case with real data about travelling decisions.

TL;DR: AI-targeted calls boost engagement and improve maternal/child health behaviors and knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if AI-targeted interventions that improve listenership also translate into better health knowledge and behaviors among beneficiaries.

Method: Utilized an AI model (restless bandit model) to target beneficiaries for live service call interventions, assessing impact on health behaviors and knowledge.

Result: AI-scheduled interventions led to statistically significant improvements in health behaviors (e.g., taking supplements) and understanding of critical health topics.

Conclusion: AI-driven interventions not only improve listenership but also significantly enhance maternal and child health behaviors and knowledge, showcasing AI's potential in healthcare.

Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for
disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are
deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often
suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through
real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit
model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service
call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one
key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via
AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and
health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership
improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these
improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that
AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically
significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron
or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of
critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the
potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

Result: 分析表明，CoT可能作为解码空间修剪器，利用答案模板引导输出生成，且模板遵循度与性能提升密切相关。此外，CoT以任务依赖性地调节神经元参与：在开放域任务中减少神经元激活，而在封闭域场景中增加激活。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个新颖的机制解释框架，揭示了CoT提示的内部工作机制，并为设计更高效、更稳健的提示提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet
its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational
principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection,
and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as
a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output
generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved
performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron
engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in
open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings
offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for
enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust
prompts. We released our code and data at

Motivation: Current methods for evaluating smart contract comment quality, such as BLEU and ROUGE, fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while human evaluation is costly and unscalable.

Method: The paper introduces \texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular framework combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies to support over 400 evaluator configurations for assessing comment quality.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation, as implemented in \texttt{evalSmarT}, provides a scalable and semantically rich alternative to traditional metrics and human evaluation, significantly improving the assessment of smart contract comment quality.

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve
code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However,
evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional
metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while
human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present
\texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator
configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies.
We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and
selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design
significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by
retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However,
conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information.
Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping
them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of
knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require
large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing
ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines
visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph
(MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to
achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths
to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets,
demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate

### [232] [On the Limits of Hierarchically Embedded Logic in Classical Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20960)
*Bill Cochran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出神经网络深度限制了其逻辑表达能力，无法表示更高阶逻辑谓词，解释了幻觉等现象，并为未来模型改进提供了方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型神经网络在语言处理中的推理限制，解释其为何会出现幻觉、重复和有限规划等现象。

Method: 通过将神经网络视为逻辑谓词空间上的线性算子，证明了每一层最多只能编码一个额外的逻辑推理级别。

Result: 证明了特定深度的神经网络无法忠实表示更高阶的逻辑谓词（如复杂谓词的简单计数），从而确定了逻辑表达能力的严格上限。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了神经网络架构的深度限制了其逻辑表达能力，尤其是无法准确表示更高阶的逻辑谓词。这为未来语言模型的架构扩展和可解释性策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.

### [233] [Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964)
*Aran Nayebi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可实现的修正性框架，通过五个分离的效用头和严格的权重间隙组合，在多步部分可观察环境中提供安全性和人类利益保障，并解决了开放环境中的对手修改问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有方法（如宪法AI或RLHF/RLAIF）将所有规范合并为一个学习标量的问题，该研究通过分离效用头，确保即使在激励冲突时，顺从性和影响限制仍占主导地位。

Method: 框架采用五个分离的效用头（顺从性、切换访问保护、真实性、基于信念的低影响行为和有限任务奖励），并通过严格的权重间隙进行词典式组合。理论1证明了在部分可观察的关闭开关游戏中的单轮修正性；理论3将保障扩展到多步自衍生代理。

Result: 论文证明了即使在每个效用头学习到均方误差ε且规划器为ε次优的情况下，违反任何安全属性的概率仍有限，同时确保人类净利益。对于开放环境中的对手修改代理，证明了判断任意被黑代理是否会违反修正性是图灵不可判定的，但提出了一个有限时间范围的“可判定岛屿”。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了首个可实现的修正性框架，并在多步、部分可观察环境中提供了可证明的保障。通过将单一不透明的奖励替换为五个结构分离的效用头，并采用严格的权重间隙进行词典式组合，确保了安全性和人类利益。

Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with
provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our
framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*
utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,
low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility
Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict
weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially
observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,
self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,
the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still
ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,
which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience
and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended
settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether
an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by
reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable
island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and
verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.
Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage
and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality
rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation
guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

TL;DR: MIRAGE-Bench是首个统一基准，用于评估LLM代理在交互场景中的幻觉行为，通过分类法和LLM评估范式提供高保真分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有评估的碎片化问题，缺乏原则性测试平台，以统一基准衡量和评估交互式LLM代理场景中的幻觉。

Method: 引入三部分分类法来识别代理幻觉，采用系统审计现有代理基准并合成测试用例的策略，使用细粒度LLM-as-a-Judge范式进行评估。

Result: MIRAGE-Bench是第一个统一的基准，用于在交互式LLM代理场景中引发和评估幻觉，提供了可扩展、高保真的代理行为评估方法。

Conclusion: MIRAGE-Bench为交互式环境中减轻LLM代理的幻觉提供了基础，并提供了关于失败模式的可操作见解。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based
agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or
misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies
have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a
principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions
in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and
evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by
introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions
that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)
environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by
performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize
test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in
deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we
adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware
prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without
enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on
failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in
mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

TL;DR: GenoMAS通过LLM代理团队和动态规划框架，显著提升了基因表达分析的性能，同时揭示了生物学上可信的基因-表型关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基因表达分析自动化方法在灵活性和精确性上存在局限，GenoMAS旨在通过结合结构化工作流和自主代理的优势，解决这一问题。

Method: GenoMAS采用基于LLM的科学家团队，通过类型化消息传递协议协调六个专用LLM代理，结合引导规划框架，动态调整任务执行策略。

Result: 在GenoTEX基准测试中，GenoMAS的数据预处理复合相似性相关性达到89.13%，基因识别的F1得分为60.48%，分别比先前最佳方法提高了10.61%和16.85%。

Conclusion: GenoMAS通过整合结构化工作流程的可靠性和自主代理的适应性，成功提升了基因表达分析的效率和准确性，特别是在数据预处理和基因识别方面表现优异。

Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet
extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the
complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive
domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either
inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous
agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.
GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists
that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability
of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through
typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a
shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning
framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action
Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,
thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the
idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation
of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene
identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%
respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible
gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting
for latent confounders. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoMAS.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在开放交互环境中的静态特性成为关键瓶颈，亟需能够实时自适应推理、行动和进化的智能体。

Method: 本文通过分类和分析自进化智能体的进化机制、适应方法和设计架构（如模型、记忆、工具、架构等），以及评估指标和基准测试，系统地回顾了这一领域。

Result: 本文综述了自进化智能体的进化机制、方法分类、设计架构、评估指标和应用领域（如编程、教育、医疗），并指出了安全性、可扩展性和协同进化动态等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个系统性和全面的自进化智能体综述，围绕三个基础维度（进化内容、时机和方法）展开，为研究和实际部署自适应智能体系统提供了结构化框架，并展望了实现人工超级智能（ASI）的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,
highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,
and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,
scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework
for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a
roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world
deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,
performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 研究验证了Sionna射线追踪在室外蜂窝链路的模拟效果，发现天线位置和方向是关键因素，优化后性能显著提升，但模拟数据仍不如真实数据精确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Sionna v1.0.2射线追踪在罗马市中心室外蜂窝链路的真实感，以验证模拟器的保真度。

Method: 使用真实测量的1,664个用户设备和6个基站站点位置，系统性地变化主要模拟参数（如路径深度、散射/反射标志、载波频率、天线属性等），并通过Spearman相关性和基于RSSI指纹的k近邻定位算法评估模拟器的保真度。

Result: 天线位置和方向对模拟结果影响显著，通过简单贪婪优化可将Spearman相关性提升5%至130%，kNN定位误差减少三分之一，但仍比纯真实数据高两倍。

Conclusion: 精确的几何结构和可信的天线模型是必要但不充分的；真实捕捉城市残余噪声仍然是可转移、高保真室外射频模拟的开放挑战。

Abstract: We study the realism of Sionna v1.0.2 ray-tracing for outdoor cellular links
in central Rome. We use a real measurement set of 1,664 user-equipments (UEs)
and six nominal base-station (BS) sites. Using these fixed positions we
systematically vary the main simulation parameters, including path depth,
diffuse/specular/refraction flags, carrier frequency, as well as antenna's
properties like its altitude, radiation pattern, and orientation. Simulator
fidelity is scored for each base station via Spearman correlation between
measured and simulated powers, and by a fingerprint-based k-nearest-neighbor
localization algorithm using RSSI-based fingerprints. Across all experiments,
solver hyper-parameters are having immaterial effect on the chosen metrics. On
the contrary, antenna locations and orientations prove decisive. By simple
greedy optimization we improve the Spearman correlation by 5% to 130% for
various base stations, while kNN-based localization error using only simulated
data as reference points is decreased by one-third on real-world samples, while
staying twice higher than the error with purely real data. Precise geometry and
credible antenna models are therefore necessary but not sufficient; faithfully
capturing the residual urban noise remains an open challenge for transferable,
high-fidelity outdoor RF simulation.

Motivation: 现代智能应用（如自动驾驶、数字孪生和元宇宙环境）对信息质量的要求日益复杂，传统的网络度量标准（如延迟和数据包丢失）已无法满足需求。

Method: 通过引入一个四维分类框架（时间、质量/效用、可靠性/鲁棒性、网络/通信维度）来系统化信息度量，并结合人工智能技术（如深度强化学习、多智能体系统和神经优化模型）进行自适应优化。

Result: 论文展示了六种关键应用领域（自动驾驶交通、工业物联网、医疗数字孪生、无人机通信、LLM生态系统和元宇宙环境）中多维信息度量的革命性潜力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个系统性的四维分类框架，用于结构化信息度量，揭示了人工智能技术在优化信息质量目标中的关键作用，并指出了在多维信息度量实施中的主要挑战。

Abstract: The development of next-generation networking systems has inherently shifted
from throughput-based paradigms towards intelligent, information-aware designs
that emphasize the quality, relevance, and utility of transmitted information,
rather than sheer data volume. While classical network metrics, such as latency
and packet loss, remain significant, they are insufficient to quantify the
nuanced information quality requirements of modern intelligent applications,
including autonomous vehicles, digital twins, and metaverse environments. In
this survey, we present the first comprehensive study of the ``X of
Information'' continuum by introducing a systematic four-dimensional taxonomic
framework that structures information metrics along temporal, quality/utility,
reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions. We uncover the
increasing interdependencies among these dimensions, whereby temporal freshness
triggers quality evaluation, which in turn helps with reliability appraisal,
ultimately enabling effective network delivery. Our analysis reveals that
artificial intelligence technologies, such as deep reinforcement learning,
multi-agent systems, and neural optimization models, enable adaptive,
context-aware optimization of competing information quality objectives. In our
extensive study of six critical application domains, covering autonomous
transportation, industrial IoT, healthcare digital twins, UAV communications,
LLM ecosystems, and metaverse settings, we illustrate the revolutionary promise
of multi-dimensional information metrics for meeting diverse operational needs.
Our survey identifies prominent implementation challenges, including ...

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信运营商的网络容量扩展面临关键挑战，传统方法如手动驾驶测试和静态优化未能充分考虑用户密度、地形特征和财务约束等现实因素。

Method: 结合深度神经网络进行信号覆盖预测与空间聚类，推荐服务不足区域的新基站位置，整合地理空间、人口统计和基础设施数据，并考虑预算约束以优化部署优先级。

Result: 该框架在迭代规划循环中运行，每次建议安装后细化覆盖估计，实现自适应和成本效益高的扩展。尽管数据可用性限制了全面模拟，但架构模块化、对缺失输入的鲁棒性，并适用于多种部署场景。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提供一种可扩展、数据驱动的替代方案，显著提升了无线电网络规划的效率和适应性，克服了传统手动方法的局限性。

Abstract: Network capacity expansion is a critical challenge for telecom operators,
requiring strategic placement of new cell sites to ensure optimal coverage and
performance. Traditional approaches, such as manual drive tests and static
optimization, often fail to consider key real-world factors including user
density, terrain features, and financial constraints. In this paper, we propose
a machine learning-based framework that combines deep neural networks for
signal coverage prediction with spatial clustering to recommend new tower
locations in underserved areas. The system integrates geospatial, demographic,
and infrastructural data, and incorporates budget-aware constraints to
prioritize deployments. Operating within an iterative planning loop, the
framework refines coverage estimates after each proposed installation, enabling
adaptive and cost-effective expansion. While full-scale simulation was limited
by data availability, the architecture is modular, robust to missing inputs,
and generalizable across diverse deployment scenarios. This approach advances
radio network planning by offering a scalable, data-driven alternative to
manual methods.

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种静态选择最优扩频因子的两阶段算法，解决了低成本单通道LoRa网关的通信可靠性问题，适用于成本敏感环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRaWAN网络中，自适应数据速率（ADR）机制需要昂贵的多通道网关支持，而低成本单通道网关缺乏动态配置支持，导致通信可靠性问题。

Method: 研究采用了两阶段算法：首先基于规则排除违反距离、数据速率、链路裕度和法规限制的SF，然后通过加权评分模型评估剩余候选SF，考虑空中时间、能耗、数据速率和链路鲁棒性。

Result: 通过大量现场测试和NS-3模拟验证，该算法在线视条件下92%以上的案例中选择了最优SF，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过静态选择最优扩频因子（SF）的两阶段算法，为低成本单通道LoRa网关提供了一种经济高效且节能的解决方案，适用于农业和农村传感应用等成本敏感环境。

Abstract: The deployment of mobile LoRa gateways using low-cost single-channel hardware
presents a significant challenge in maintaining reliable communication due to
the lack of dynamic configuration support. In traditional LoRaWAN networks,
Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanisms optimize communication parameters in real
time. However, such features are typically supported only by expensive
multi-channel gateways. This study proposes a cost-effective and
energy-efficient solution by statically selecting the optimal Spreading Factor
(SF) using a two-phase algorithm. The method first applies rule-based exclusion
to eliminate SFs that violate constraints related to distance, data rate, link
margin, and regulatory limits. Remaining candidates are then evaluated using a
weighted scoring model incorporating Time-on-Air, energy consumption, data
rate, and link robustness. The proposed algorithm was validated through
extensive field tests and NS-3 simulations under line-of-sight conditions.
Results demonstrate that the selected SF matched the optimal SF in over 92% of
cases across 672 simulated scenarios, confirming the algorithm's effectiveness.
This approach offers a scalable alternative to dynamic protocols, enabling
reliable mobile LoRa deployments in cost-sensitive environments such as
agriculture and rural sensing applications.

The Hera framework integrates application-aware streaming logic with a
QoE-centric rate control core, enabling adaptive video quality, multi-user
fairness, and low-latency communication across challenging 5G network

control algorithms by maintaining up to 66% lower latencies with comparable
throughput performance, higher visual quality with 50% average bitrate
improvements in our analysis, and improved fairness. By bridging the gap
between application-level responsiveness and network-level adaptability, Hera
lays the foundation for more scalable, robust, and high-fidelity multi-user

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对DDoS攻击检测中标记训练数据稀缺的问题，现有合成数据生成方法难以捕捉复杂的时间模式和空间分布，导致生成的合成数据与真实数据相似度不足，影响检测精度。

Method: 模型采用双流设计：字段流通过空间映射将网络数据特征与预训练的稳定扩散模型结合，空间流则动态建模网络流量的时间模式。基于扩散模型，实现了多视图、多流量的网络流量生成。

Result: 实验表明，DSTF-Diffusion生成的合成数据在统计上与真实数据更相似，显著提升了多种下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出了Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion)模型，通过双流设计有效生成与真实网络流量高度相似的合成数据，显著提升了DDoS攻击检测的准确性。

Abstract: In response to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, recent research
efforts increasingly rely on Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions, whose
effectiveness largely depends on the quality of labeled training datasets. To
address the scarcity of such datasets, data augmentation with synthetic traces
is often employed. However, current synthetic trace generation methods struggle
to capture the complex temporal patterns and spatial distributions exhibited in
emerging DDoS attacks. This results in insufficient resemblance to real traces
and unsatisfied detection accuracy when applied to ML tasks. In this paper, we
propose Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion), a multi-view,
multi-stream network traffic generative model based on diffusion models,
featuring two main streams: The field stream utilizes spatial mapping to bridge
network data characteristics with pre-trained realms of stable diffusion
models, effectively translating complex network interactions into formats that
stable diffusion can process, while the spatial stream adopts a dynamic
temporal modeling approach, meticulously capturing the intrinsic temporal
patterns of network traffic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data
generated by our model exhibits higher statistical similarity to originals
compared to current state-of-the-art solutions, and enhance performances on a
wide range of downstream tasks.

Method: 通过对14个SNS DAO在20个月内提交的3,000多个提案进行实证研究，测量参与率、提案提交频率、投票批准率和决策时长等指标。

Result: SNS DAOs的批准率普遍较高，且与其他区块链平台的DAOs相比，展现出更高的对齐性、活力和更快的决策速度。

Conclusion: SNS DAOs在ICP平台上展现出更高的活跃度、更低的成本和更快的决策速度，且参与度随时间持续或增加，与其他框架的研究结果形成对比。

Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) rely on governance mechanism
without centralized leadership. This paper presents an empirical study of user
behavior in governance for a variety of DAOs, ranging from DeFi to gaming,
using the Internet Computer Protocol DAO framework called SNS (Service Nervous
System). To analyse user engagement, we measure participation rates and
frequency of proposals submission and voter approval rates. We evaluate
decision duration times to determine DAO agility. To investigate dynamic
aspects, we also measure metric shifts in time. We evaluate over 3,000
proposals submitted in a time frame of 20 months from 14 SNS DAOs. The selected
DAO have been existing between 6 and 20 months and cover a wide spectrum of use
cases, treasury sizes, and number of participants. We also compare our results
for SNS DAOs with DAOs from other blockchain platforms. While approval rates
are generally high for all DAOs studied, SNS DAOs show slightly more alignment.
We observe that the SNS governance mechanisms and processes in ICP lead to
higher activity, lower costs and faster decisions. Most importantly, in
contrast to studies which report a decline in participation over time for other
frameworks, SNS DAOs exhibit sustained or increasing engagement levels over
time.

Motivation: 由于高速率/可靠性需求对回程链路的敏感性，需要适当的网络规划以确保IAB网络达到期望性能水平。

Method: 研究了在光纤连接受限的情况下，自由空间光（FSO）通信链路的性能增益和能源效率。

Result: 结果表明，混合光纤/FSO部署相比全光纤网络能节省大量成本，并在战略链路部署中提供有益权衡。

Conclusion: 混合光纤/自由空间光（FSO）部署在IAB网络中能显著降低成本，同时提升服务覆盖概率、能源效率和成本效益。

Abstract: Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) is one of the promising techniques for
5G networks and beyond (6G), in which the same node/hardware is used to provide
both backhaul and cellular services in a multi-hop architecture. Due to the
sensitivity of the backhaul links with high rate/reliability demands, proper
network planning is needed to ensure the IAB network performs with the desired
performance levels. In this paper, we study the effect of infrastructure
planning and optimization on the coverage of IAB networks. We concentrate on
the cases where the fiber connectivity to the nodes is constrained due to cost.
Thereby, we study the performance gains and energy efficiency in the presence
of free-space optical (FSO) communication links. Our results indicate hybrid
fiber/FSO deployments offer substantial cost savings compared to fully fibered
networks, suggesting a beneficial trade-off for strategic link deployment while
improving the service coverage probability. As we show, with proper network
planning, the service coverage, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency can be
improved.

Abstract: Remote driving, or teleoperating Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), is a key
application that emerging 5G networks aim to support. In this paper, we conduct
a systematic feasibility study of AV teleoperation over commercial 5G networks
from both cross-layer and end-to-end (E2E) perspectives. Given the critical
importance of timely delivery of sensor data, such as camera and LiDAR data,
for AV teleoperation, we focus in particular on the performance of uplink
sensor data delivery. We analyze the impacts of Physical Layer (PHY layer) 5G
radio network factors, including channel conditions, radio resource allocation,
and Handovers (HOs), on E2E latency performance. We also examine the impacts of
5G networks on the performance of upper-layer protocols and E2E application
Quality-of-Experience (QoE) adaptation mechanisms used for real-time sensor
data delivery, such as Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and Web Real Time
Communication (WebRTC). Our study reveals the challenges posed by today's 5G
networks and the limitations of existing sensor data streaming mechanisms. The
insights gained will help inform the co-design of future-generation wireless
networks, edge cloud systems, and applications to overcome the low-latency
barriers in AV teleoperation.

Motivation: 解决传统Deep-JSCC固定结构无法适应设备能力、实时性能优化、功率限制和信道条件变化的问题。

Method: 采用分层激活机制和顺序随机化训练的隐式正则化方法，动态调整层结构以适应不同条件。

Result: DD-JSCC在PSNR上比固定Deep-JSCC架构提升2 dB，训练成本降低40%以上。

Conclusion: DD-JSCC通过动态调整编码器-解码器结构，显著提升了语义通信中的图像重建性能，同时降低了训练复杂性和部署开销。

Abstract: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (Deep-JSCC) has emerged as a promising
semantic communication approach for wireless image transmission by jointly
optimizing source and channel coding using deep learning techniques. However,
traditional Deep-JSCC architectures employ fixed encoder-decoder structures,
limiting their adaptability to varying device capabilities, real-time
performance optimization, power constraints and channel conditions. To address
these limitations, we propose DD-JSCC: Dynamic Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding
for Semantic Communications, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed for
semantic communication systems. Unlike traditional Deep-JSCC models, DD-JSCC is
flexible for dynamically adjusting its layer structures in real-time based on
transmitter and receiver capabilities, power constraints, compression ratios,
and current channel conditions. This adaptability is achieved through a
hierarchical layer activation mechanism combined with implicit regularization
via sequential randomized training, effectively reducing combinatorial
complexity, preventing overfitting, and ensuring consistent feature
representations across varying configurations. Simulation results demonstrate
that DD-JSCC enhances the performance of image reconstruction in semantic
communications, achieving up to 2 dB improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR) over fixed Deep-JSCC architectures, while reducing training costs by
over 40%. The proposed unified framework eliminates the need for multiple
specialized models, significantly reducing training complexity and deployment
overhead.

Conclusion: 本文通过提出一种基于扩散模型的深度确定性策略梯度（D3PG）算法，有效解决了无人机辅助车联网中的联合信道分配、功率控制和飞行高度调整问题，显著提升了通信总速率并满足无人机的长期能量约束。

Abstract: Low altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to facilitate the
development of aerial-ground integrated intelligent transportation systems and
unlocking the potential of the emerging low-altitude economy. However, several
critical challenges persist, including the dynamic optimization of network
resources and UAV trajectories, limited UAV endurance, and imperfect channel
state information (CSI). In this paper, we offer new insights into low-altitude
economy networking by exploring intelligent UAV-assisted vehicle-to-everything
communication strategies aligned with UAV energy efficiency. Particularly, we
formulate an optimization problem of joint channel allocation, power control,
and flight altitude adjustment in UAV-assisted vehicular networks. Taking CSI
feedback delay into account, our objective is to maximize the vehicle-to-UAV
communication sum rate while satisfying the UAV's long-term energy constraint.
To this end, we first leverage Lyapunov optimization to decompose the original
long-term problem into a series of per-slot deterministic subproblems. We then
propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm,
which innovatively integrates diffusion models to determine optimal channel
allocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment decisions. Through
extensive simulations using real-world vehicle mobility traces, we demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed D3PG algorithm compared to existing
benchmark solutions.

TL;DR: PDNS利用单服务器PIR技术增强DNS隐私，性能优于DoH over Tor，但可扩展性需未来硬件支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNS隐私长期被忽视，现有解决方案如DoH和ODoH依赖难以保证的非共谋假设，存在隐私泄露风险。

Method: 提出PDNS，一种利用单服务器PIR技术的DNS扩展，通过原型实现和基于跟踪的实验与现有解决方案进行性能对比。

Result: PDNS在性能上比DoH over Tor快2倍，并提供相似的隐私保证，但可扩展性受限。

Conclusion: PDNS通过单服务器PIR技术增强了DNS的隐私保护，虽然牺牲了部分可扩展性，但提供了可接受的性能和强大的隐私保证。未来可通过专用硬件解决可扩展性问题。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in Internet user privacy, demonstrated by
the popularity of privacy-preserving products such as Telegram and Brave, and
the widespread adoption of HTTPS. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a key
component of Internet-based communication and its privacy has been neglected
for years. Recently, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) has improved the situation by fixing
the issue of in-path middleboxes. Further progress has been made with
proxy-based solutions such as Oblivious DoH (ODoH), which separate a user's
identity from their DNS queries. However, these solutions rely on non-collusion
assumptions between DNS resolvers and proxies -- an assumption difficult to
guarantee in practice. To address this, we explore integrating single-server
Private Information Retrieval (PIR) into DNS to enable encrypted query
processing without relying on trust assumptions. However, applying PIR to DNS
is challenging due to its hierarchical nature -- particularly, interactions
with recursive resolvers can still leak information. Navigating performance and
privacy trade-offs, we propose PDNS, a DNS extension leveraging single-server
PIR to strengthen privacy guarantees. We have implemented a prototype of PDNS
and compared its performance against state-of-the-art solutions via
trace-driven experiments. The results show that PDNS achieves acceptable
performance (2x faster than DoH over Tor with similar privacy guarantees) and
strong privacy guarantees today, mainly at the cost of its scalability, which
specialized hardware for PIR can address in the near future.

TL;DR: FedABC是一种创新的客户端选择算法，通过长期视角管理数据异构性和优化客户端参与，显著提升联邦学习在6G网络中的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决联邦学习（FL）中客户端数据异构性导致的收敛速度慢、模型精度下降以及频繁客户端参与带来的通信和计算负担问题。

Method: 受注意力机制启发，FedABC通过评估模型相似性和每个模型对全局模型的独特贡献来优先选择信息丰富的客户端，并根据全局模型的需求动态调整客户端选择阈值。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上的大量模拟表明，FedABC在模型精度和客户端参与效率上显著优于现有方法，比经典FL算法FedAvg节省32%的客户端，比最先进方法提高3.5%的精度并减少2%的客户端。

Conclusion: 本文提出的FedABC算法在6G网络中支持原生AI能力方面迈出了重要一步，通过优化客户端选择和长期视角管理数据异构性，显著提升了模型精度和客户端参与效率。

Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with
Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows
decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly
sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private
data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the
global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data
heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client
participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these
challenges, we propose \textit{FedABC}, an innovative client selection
algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and
optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms,
\textit{FedABC} prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model
similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover,
considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an
optimization problem to guide \textit{FedABC} throughout the training process.
Following the ``later-is-better" principle, \textit{FedABC} adaptively adjusts
the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later
training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that
\textit{FedABC} significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy
and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32\%
fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm \textit{FedAvg}, and 3.5\% higher
accuracy with 2\% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a
step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments,
thereby supporting native AI capabilities in 6G networks.

Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动的NDT平台在面对流量变化时的弹性不足问题，并提升虚拟孪生与物理孪生之间的同步性。

Method: 采用自适应性NDT架构，结合遥测模块监控流量变化，并利用概念漂移检测技术指导VTwin的重新训练和部署。

Result: 在多种网络拓扑和流量模式下验证，架构在流量概念漂移后，延迟预测性能提升至少56.7%（以归一化均方误差为评估指标）。

Conclusion: 本文提出的自适应性网络数字孪生（NDT）架构通过实时监测流量变化并动态调整虚拟孪生（VTwin），显著提升了延迟预测的准确性，尤其在流量波动条件下表现优异。

Abstract: The ability of the network digital twin (NDT) to remain aware of changes in
its physical counterpart, known as the physical twin (PTwin), is a fundamental
condition to enable timely synchronization, also referred to as twinning. In
this way, considering a transport network, a key requirement is to handle
unexpected traffic variability and dynamically adapt to maintain optimal
performance in the associated virtual model, known as the virtual twin (VTwin).
In this context, we propose a self-adaptive implementation of a novel NDT
architecture designed to provide accurate delay predictions, even under
fluctuating traffic conditions. This architecture addresses an essential
challenge, underexplored in the literature: improving the resilience of
data-driven NDT platforms against traffic variability and improving
synchronization between the VTwin and its physical counterpart. Therefore, the
contributions of this article rely on NDT lifecycle by focusing on the
operational phase, where telemetry modules are used to monitor incoming
traffic, and concept drift detection techniques guide retraining decisions
aimed at updating and redeploying the VTwin when necessary. We validate our
architecture with a network management use case, across various emulated
network topologies, and diverse traffic patterns to demonstrate its
effectiveness in preserving acceptable performance and predicting per-flow
delay under unexpected traffic variation. The results in all tested topologies,
using the normalized mean square error as the evaluation metric, demonstrate
that our proposed architecture, after a traffic concept drift, achieves a
performance improvement in prediction of at least 56.7% compared to a
configuration without NDT synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数网页不符合可访问性指南，导致多样能力的用户无法访问内容，手动修正成本高，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新的分类法，将网页可访问性违规分为语法、语义和布局三类，并开发了AccessGuru方法，结合现有工具和LLMs进行检测和纠正。

Result: AccessGuru在真实世界网页可访问性违规的基准测试中表现优异，平均违规分数降低了84%。

Conclusion: AccessGuru通过结合现有的可访问性测试工具和大型语言模型（LLMs），显著提高了检测和纠正网页可访问性违规的能力，平均违规分数降低了84%，远超之前最多50%的方法。

Abstract: The vast majority of Web pages fail to comply with established Web
accessibility guidelines, excluding a range of users with diverse abilities
from interacting with their content. Making Web pages accessible to all users
requires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page
providers. To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to
automatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code.
While previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of
accessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting
accessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We
introduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three
key categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a
structured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and
redefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which
combines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)
to detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to
correct all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a
benchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies
syntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through
comparative analysis with human expert corrections. Evaluation against our
benchmark shows that AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average violation score
decrease, significantly outperforming prior methods that achieve at most 50%.

Motivation: 解决结构化AST合并工具因语言特定性和高成本而难以广泛应用的问题，提出一种通用的结构化合并工具LastMerge。

Method: 通过实验比较四种结构化合并工具（两种Java专用工具jDime和Spork，及其通用对应工具LastMerge和Mergiraf），分析运行时间、行为差异和合并准确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，通用结构化合并工具在准确性上与语言特定工具无显著差异，且在减少误报和漏报方面表现更优，运行时间与现有工具相当。

Conclusion: 通用结构化合并工具（如LastMerge和Mergiraf）可以有效替代特定语言的工具，为结构化合并的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Unstructured line-based merge tools are widely used in practice. Structured
AST-based merge tools show significantly improved merge accuracy, but are
rarely used in practice because they are language specific and costly,
consequently not being available for many programming languages. To improve
merge accuracy for a wide range of languages, we propose LastMerge, a generic
structured merge tool that can be configured through a thin interface that
significantly reduces the effort of supporting structured merge. To understand
the impact that generic structured merge might have on merge accuracy and
performance, we run an experiment with four structured merge tools: two Java
specific tools, jDime and Spork, and their generic counterparts, respectively
LastMerge and Mergiraf. Using each tool, we replay merge scenarios from a
significant dataset, and collect data on runtime, behavioral divergences, and
merge accuracy. Our results show no evidence that generic structured merge
significantly impacts merge accuracy. Although we observe a difference rate of
approximately 10% between the Java specific tools and their generic
counterparts, most of the differences stem from implementation details and
could be avoided. We find that LastMerge reports 15% fewer false positives than
jDime while Mergiraf misses 42% fewer false negatives than Spork. Both generic
tools exhibit comparable runtime performance to the state of the art language
specific implementations. These results suggest that generic structured merge
tools can effectively replace language-specific ones, paving the way for
broader adoption of structured merge in industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估和方法论阶段大多忽略了代码重构，尽管其普遍存在。重构及其传播常与缺陷修复和引入变更混杂，忽略重构可能为JIT-DP模型的学习和评估引入偏差。

Method: 提出Code chAnge Tactics（CAT）分析来分类代码重构及其传播，并在JIT-Defects4J数据集中提高了13.7%的标签准确性。通过实验验证，未考虑重构信息会降低模型性能，尤其是基于语义的模型。

Result: 实验表明，未考虑重构信息会使模型性能下降，尤其是语义模型（F1-score下降18.6%和37.3%）。整合重构信息后，六种基线方法的召回率和F1-score分别提升高达43.2%和32.5%。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了在JIT缺陷预测（JIT-DP）的方法和评估中纳入重构信息的重要性，并展示了CAT在软件维护中分析重构及其传播的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Just-in-time defect prediction (JIT-DP) aims to predict the likelihood of
code changes resulting in software defects at an early stage. Although code
change metrics and semantic features have enhanced prediction accuracy, prior
research has largely ignored code refactoring during both the evaluation and
methodology phases, despite its prevalence. Refactoring and its propagation
often tangle with bug-fixing and bug-inducing changes within the same commit
and statement. Neglecting refactoring can introduce bias into the learning and
evaluation of JIT-DP models. To address this gap, we investigate the impact of
refactoring and its propagation on six state-of-the-art JIT-DP approaches. We
propose Code chAnge Tactics (CAT) analysis to categorize code refactoring and
its propagation, which improves labeling accuracy in the JIT-Defects4J dataset
by 13.7%. Our experiments reveal that failing to consider refactoring
information in the dataset can diminish the performance of models, particularly
semantic-based models, by 18.6% and 37.3% in F1-score. Additionally, we propose
integrating refactoring information to enhance six baseline approaches,
resulting in overall improvements in recall and F1-score, with increases of up
to 43.2% and 32.5%, respectively. Our research underscores the importance of
incorporating refactoring information in the methodology and evaluation of
JIT-DP. Furthermore, our CAT has broad applicability in analyzing refactoring
and its propagation for software maintenance.

Abstract: Reliability prediction is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of

various metrics and measurements are employed to assess software reliability,
the complexity of modern systems necessitates a deeper understanding of how

the interplay between software reliability, safety, and security, offering a
comprehensive analysis of key metrics and measurement techniques used in the
industry for reliability prediction. We identify critical threats to software
reliability and provide a threat estimation framework that incorporates both
safety and security aspects. Our findings suggest that integrating reliability
metrics with safety and security considerations can enhance the robustness of
software systems. Furthermore, we propose a set of actionable guidelines for
practitioners to improve their reliability prediction models while
simultaneously addressing the security and safety challenges of contemporary

Conclusion: 该研究呼吁关注代码生成中的伦理问题，并提出了11个维度的ES-CodeGen框架，强调了社会相关维度的重要性。

Abstract: Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and
effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are
growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing,
privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching
goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing
attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we
introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to
refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development
from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices.
To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review
where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code
generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of
ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of
ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who
submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users
have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation
models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension
on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified
consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey
reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related
dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or
strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen.
Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.

Result: 在三个公共日志数据集上的实验结果表明，FreeLog 在零标签条件下实现了与依赖少量目标系统标记数据的现有方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: FreeLog 提出了一种无需目标系统标记日志的跨系统日志异常检测方法，解决了冷启动问题，并在零标签条件下实现了与现有方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Log anomaly detection plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and
reliability of software systems. However, existing approaches rely on large
amounts of labeled log data, which poses significant challenges in real-world
applications. To address this issue, cross-system transfer has been identified
as a key research direction. State-of-the-art cross-system approaches achieve
promising performance with only a few labels from the target system. However,
their reliance on labeled target logs makes them susceptible to the cold-start
problem when labeled logs are insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we
explore a novel yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log anomaly
detection, where the target system logs are entirely unlabeled. To this end, we
propose FreeLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that
eliminates the need for labeled target system logs, enabling cross-system log
anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. Experimental results on three
public log datasets demonstrate that FreeLog achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods that rely on a small amount of labeled data from the
target system.

Abstract: Enterprises are currently undergoing profound transformations due to the
unpostponable digital transformation. Then, to remain competitive, enterprises
must adapt their organisational structures and operations. This organisational
shift is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises. A key
innovation frontier is the adoption of process-oriented production models. This
paper presents a knowledge-based method to support business experts in
designing business processes. The method requires no prior expertise in
Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of
steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The
construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge
artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations.
The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders
and actors who participate in the BP design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件开发需要多方协作且复杂，旨在通过多智能体协作框架自动化这一过程，提高效率并减少人为错误。

Method: 提出了一个基于Python的多智能体框架AgentMesh，包括Planner、Coder、Debugger和Reviewer四个专门代理，通过协作实现从需求到代码的自动化开发。

Result: 通过案例研究展示了AgentMesh如何处理非平凡的开发请求，验证了多智能体协作在软件开发中的有效性。

Conclusion: AgentMesh通过多智能体协作框架，展示了利用LLM自动化软件开发的潜力，并指出了当前局限性和未来改进方向。

Abstract: Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally
requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose
AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered
agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents
- a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a
high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first
decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements
each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the
Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We
describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication,
and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow
orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial
development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative
debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities
among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while
mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations -
such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward
more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering
automation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CrossPL是首个系统性评估LLMs生成跨编程语言互操作性代码能力的基准，覆盖6种语言和7种技术，结果显示现有模型表现不足，需进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在软件工程中的广泛应用，生成支持跨编程语言互操作性的正确代码能力尚未充分探索，这对构建复杂多语言系统至关重要。

Method: 通过分析19,169个多语言GitHub仓库，使用156个手工构建的有限状态机（FSMs）和基于LLM的管道，自动提取CPL代码片段、生成任务指令并验证功能正确性。

Result: 评估了14个通用LLMs和6个面向代码的LLMs，发现即使是表现最佳的模型在CPL场景中也表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的大语言模型在跨编程语言（CPL）互操作性代码生成方面表现不佳，表明需要更多针对性研究。CrossPL基准和代码已公开。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in software
engineering workflows, a critical capability remains underexplored: generating
correct code that enables cross-programming-language (CPL) interoperability.
This skill is essential for building complex systems that integrate components
written in multiple languages via mechanisms like inter-process communication
(IPC). To bridge this gap, we present CrossPL, the first benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate LLMs' ability to generate CPL-interoperating code.
CrossPL comprises 1,982 tasks centered around IPC, covering six widely-used
programming languages and seven representative CPL techniques. We construct
this benchmark by (i) analyzing 19,169 multi-language GitHub repositories using
156 hand-crafted finite state machines (FSMs), and (ii) developing an LLM-based
pipeline that automatically extracts CPL code snippets, generates task
instructions, and validates functional correctness. We evaluate 14
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs and 6 code-oriented LLMs released in the
past three years on CrossPL via FSM-based validation. Results reveal that even
the best-performing models struggle with CPL scenarios, underscoring the need
for more targeted research in this space. Our benchmark and code are available

TL;DR: 研究比较了不同微调技术对APR任务中LLMs性能的影响，发现参数高效微调（PEFT）优于完全微调，能有效提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同微调技术对用于自动程序修复（APR）的大型语言模型（LLMs）性能的影响，以降低计算成本并提升模型适应性。

Method: 本研究通过实验评估了六种不同参数规模的预训练LLMs（CodeGen、CodeT5、StarCoder、DeepSeekCoder、Bloom和CodeLlama-2）在三个流行的APR基准测试（QuixBugs、Defects4J和HumanEval-Java）上的表现，比较了三种训练方案（不微调、完全微调和参数高效微调）。

Result: 完全微调技术会因数据分布差异和过拟合问题降低模型的基准测试性能，而参数高效微调方法（如LoRA和IA3）通过限制可训练参数数量取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 通过参数高效微调（PEFT）方法限制可训练参数的数量，能够取得比完全微调更好的结果。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) uses various tools and techniques to help
developers achieve functional and error-free code faster. In recent years,
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool
chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such
models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have
been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and
enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from
scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various
fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments
provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs
pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks
(i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs
with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder,
Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning,
full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and
IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking
performance of various models due to different data distributions and
overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict
models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.
  Keywords: large language models, automated program repair,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning, AI4Code, AI4SE, ML4SE.

TL;DR: Prometheus是一个多代理系统，通过知识图技术解决多语言代码仓库中的问题，显著提升了问题解决率和语言覆盖范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型代理（如SWE-agent和OpenHands）主要局限于Python问题，且依赖于预构建容器，限制了其在多语言仓库和实际场景中的应用。Prometheus旨在解决这些限制，提升问题解决的广泛性和实用性。

Method: Prometheus将整个代码仓库转化为统一知识图，支持多种编程语言，利用Neo4j进行图持久化，并通过DeepSeek-V3模型集成实现大规模代码库的结构化推理。

Result: Prometheus在SWE-bench Lite和SWE-bench Multilingual上分别解决了28.67%和13.7%的问题，平均API成本为每问题0.23美元和0.38美元，并成功解决了10个先前工作未解决的问题。

Conclusion: Prometheus是一个多代理系统，通过将代码仓库转化为统一知识图，有效解决了多语言仓库中的实际问题，并在SWE-bench Lite和SWE-bench Multilingual上分别解决了28.67%和13.7%的问题，同时展示了在七种编程语言中的有效性。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents, such as SWE-agent and OpenHands, have made
progress toward automated issue resolution. However, existing approaches are
often limited to Python-only issues and rely on pre-constructed containers in
SWE-bench with reproduced issues, restricting their applicability to real-world
and work for multi-language repositories. We present Prometheus, designed to
resolve real-world issues beyond benchmark settings. Prometheus is a
multi-agent system that transforms an entire code repository into a unified
knowledge graph to guide context retrieval for issue resolution. Prometheus
encodes files, abstract syntax trees, and natural language text into a graph of
typed nodes and five general edge types to support multiple programming
languages. Prometheus uses Neo4j for graph persistence, enabling scalable and
structured reasoning over large codebases. Integrated by the DeepSeek-V3 model,
Prometheus resolves 28.67% and 13.7% of issues on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench
Multilingual, respectively, with an average API cost of $0.23 and $0.38 per
issue. Prometheus resolves 10 unique issues not addressed by prior work and is
the first to demonstrate effectiveness across seven programming languages.
Moreover, it shows the ability to resolve real-world GitHub issues in the
LangChain and OpenHands repositories. We have open-sourced Prometheus at:

*Shengcheng Duan,Yihua Xu,Sheng Zhang,Shen Wang,Yue Duan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PDLogger 是一种端到端日志生成技术，通过分阶段的预测、生成和优化，显著提升日志质量，适用于实际多日志场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化日志技术仅关注孤立子任务（如预测单个日志位置、级别或消息），无法生成反映实际多日志场景的完整高质量日志。它们忽略了方法间的深层语义依赖，且仅考虑有限候选变量，导致日志表浅或不完整。

Method: PDLogger 分为三个阶段：(1) 日志位置预测：利用块类型感知的结构化提示指导 LLM 在方法的所有控制流块中建议候选位置；(2) 日志生成：通过后向程序切片提供精确的跨过程控制和数据依赖上下文，同时扩展变量提取器捕获成员和外部函数表达式，使 LLM 能生成完整日志；(3) 日志优化：通过级别校正和上下文敏感去重减少误报和冗余日志。

Result: 在 3,113 条日志语句上的评估显示，PDLogger 显著优于现有系统：日志位置精确度提升 139.0%，F1 值提升 69.2%，级别准确度提升 82.3%，变量精确度提升 131.8%，消息质量（BERTScore）提升 65.7%。

Conclusion: PDLogger 是一种端到端的日志生成技术，专门为实际多日志场景设计，显著提升了日志位置、级别、变量和消息的质量，并在不同主流大型语言模型（LLM）上表现出鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Logging is indispensable for maintaining the reliability and diagnosability
of modern software, yet developers still struggle to decide where and how to
log effectively. Existing automated logging techniques focus on isolated
sub-tasks - predicting a single log position, level, or message - and therefore
cannot produce complete, high-quality log statements that reflect real-world
practice in which multiple logs often appear inside one method. They also
neglect deeper semantic dependencies among methods and consider only a narrow
set of candidate variables, leading to superficial or incomplete logs. In this
paper, we present PDLogger, the first end-to-end log generation technique
expressly designed for practical, multi-log scenarios. PDLogger operates in
three phases. (1) Log position prediction: block-type-aware structured prompts
guide a large language model (LLM) to suggest candidate positions across all
control-flow blocks of a method. (2) Log generation: backward program slicing
supplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an
expanded variable extractor captures both member and external function
expressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement
(position, level, message, variables). (3) Log refinement: level correction and
context-sensitive deduplication prune false positives and redundant logs. We
evaluate PDLogger on 3,113 log statements drawn from two widely used Java
projects. Compared with the strongest prior systems, PDLogger improves
log-position precision by 139.0 percent, F1 by 69.2 percent, level accuracy by
82.3 percent, variable precision by 131.8 percent, and message quality
(BERTScore) by 65.7 percent. The framework consistently performs well with
different mainstream LLMs, demonstrating robustness and generality. PDLogger's
implementation is available as open source to foster future research and
adoption.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了指针分析对语义冲突检测的影响，发现其虽减少误报但增加漏报，建议探索混合分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前合并工具无法检测语义冲突，且现有静态分析方法存在高误报率，研究者希望了解指针分析是否能减少误报。

Method: 研究者通过实证研究，比较了使用和不使用指针分析的静态分析方法在语义冲突检测上的表现。

Result: 研究发现指针分析显著减少了超时和误报，但也大幅增加了漏报，导致召回率和F1分数急剧下降。

Conclusion: 论文建议在语义冲突检测的背景下，应探索结合两种实现优点的混合分析技术。

Abstract: Current merge tools don't detect semantic conflicts, which occur when changes
from different developers are textually integrated but semantically interfere
with each other. Although researchers have proposed static analyses for
detecting semantic conflicts, these analyses suffer from significant false
positive rates. To understand whether such false positives could be reduced by
using pointer analysis in the implementation of semantic conflict static
analyses, we conduct an empirical study. We implement the same analysis with
and without pointer analysis, run them on two datasets, observe how often they
differ, and compare their accuracy and computational performance. Although
pointer analysis is known to improve precision in static analysis, we find that
its effect on semantic conflict detection can be drastic: we observe a
significant reduction in timeouts and false positives, but also a significant
increase in false negatives, with prohibitive drops in recall and F1-score.
These results suggest that, in the context of semantic conflict detection, we
should explore hybrid analysis techniques, combining aspects of both
implementations we compare in our study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有研究通常孤立地考察单个CI服务，但项目如何随时间采用和转换多个服务仍不明确。本研究旨在理解跨服务的CI采用演变。

Method: 通过对2008年1月至2024年12月期间托管在GitHub上的18,924个Java项目的历史CI采用情况进行分析，研究调查了CI服务的共同采用或替换频率，以及不同服务间的维护活动差异。

Result: 分析显示，近五分之一的项目中观察到了多CI服务的使用模式，这通常反映了跨CI服务的迁移。

Conclusion: 该研究首次探讨了多CI服务的实际采用情况，为未来研究提供了新见解，并强调了在动态CI环境中支持服务选择、协调和迁移的策略与工具的必要性。

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) services, such as GitHub Actions and Travis CI,
are widely adopted in open-source development to automate testing and
deployment. Though existing research often examines individual services in
isolation, it remains unclear how projects adopt and transition between
multiple services over time. To understand how CI adoption is evolving across
services, we present a preliminary study analyzing the historical CI adoption
of 18,924 Java projects hosted on GitHub between January 2008 and December
2024, adopting at least one of eight CI services, namely Travis CI, AppVeyor,
CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, Bitbucket, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI.
Specifically, we investigate: (1) how frequently CI services are co-adopted or
replaced, and (2) how maintenance activity varies across different services.
Our analysis shows that the use of multiple CI services within the same project
is a recurring pattern observed in nearly one in five projects, often
reflecting migration across CI services. Our study is among the first to
examine multi-CI adoption in practice, offering new insights for future
research and highlighting the need for strategies and tools to support service
selection, coordination, and migration in evolving CI environments.

Motivation: 尽管SFT和DPO在代码偏好对齐中表现出色，但最佳训练策略在不同场景中仍不明确，因此需要系统性研究以优化模型表现。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，比较了监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）在不同代码偏好场景中的表现，并提出了自适应偏好优化（APO）的动态整合方法。

Result: 实验表明，APO在六种代表性代码偏好任务中表现优于或与现有策略（SFT和S&D）相当，验证了理论假设。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了自适应偏好优化（APO），通过动态整合方法在不同代码偏好场景中优化训练策略，实验证明APO在多种任务中表现优于或与现有策略相当，为代码偏好对齐提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
automating software development tasks. While recent advances leverage
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
models with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear
across diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically
investigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code
preferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we
hypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal
solutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore
superior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal
solutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive
Preference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively
amplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages
exploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive
experiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our
theoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or
surpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&D strategies. Our work provides
both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for selecting appropriate
training strategies in different code preference alignment scenarios.

Motivation: 生物信息学数据分析的复杂性增加，使得科学工作流系统（SWSs）成为实现可扩展、可重复和自动化工作流的关键工具。然而，创建和理解这些工作流对缺乏编程专业知识的领域专家仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过评估GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5 Flash和DeepSeek-V3在多样任务（如SNP分析、RNA-seq、DNA甲基化和数据检索）中的表现，比较图形化（Galaxy）和脚本式（Nextflow）平台上的工作流生成能力。专家根据Galaxy Training Network和nf-core存储库的社区基准进行评估。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Flash在生成Galaxy工作流方面表现优异，而DeepSeek-V3在Nextflow上表现强劲。提示策略对质量有显著影响，角色扮演和思维链提示能提高完整性和正确性。GPT-4o受益于结构化输入，DeepSeek-V3则提供丰富的技术细节，尽管略显冗长。

Conclusion: 研究强调了大型语言模型（LLMs）在降低生物信息学工作流开发门槛、提高可重复性和普及计算工具方面的潜力，尤其是在结合精心设计的提示策略时。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of bioinformatics data analysis has made Scientific
Workflow Systems (SWSs) like Galaxy and Nextflow essential for enabling
scalable, reproducible, and automated workflows. However, creating and
understanding these workflows remains challenging, particularly for domain
experts without programming expertise. This study investigates whether modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, can
support the generation of accurate, complete, and usable bioinformatics
workflows, and examines which prompting strategies most effectively guide this
process. We evaluate these models using diverse tasks such as SNP analysis,
RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and data retrieval, spanning both graphical (Galaxy)
and script-based (Nextflow) platforms. Expert reviewers assess the generated
workflows against community-curated baselines from the Galaxy Training Network
and nf-core repositories. The results show that Gemini 2.5 Flash excels in
generating Galaxy workflows, while DeepSeek-V3 performs strongly in Nextflow.
Prompting strategies significantly impact quality, with role-based and
chain-of-thought prompts improving completeness and correctness. While GPT-4o
benefits from structured inputs, DeepSeek-V3 offers rich technical detail,
albeit with some verbosity. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of
LLMs to lower the barrier for workflow development, improve reproducibility,
and democratize access to computational tools in bioinformatics, especially
when combined with thoughtful prompt engineering.

Motivation: 在航空应用中集成机器学习模型时，系统安全目标与模型性能要求及关联指标之间的关系往往不明确，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 提出了一个方法，明确了MLC及其底层深度神经网络的安全相关性能要求、指标和目标，以满足安全目标。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种方法，用于从安全评估过程中获得的定量安全目标出发，推导出机器学习组件（MLC）及其底层深度神经网络的最低安全相关性能要求、相关指标及其目标，以确保满足安全目标。

Abstract: The prediction quality of machine learnt models and the functionality they
ultimately enable (e.g., object detection), is typically evaluated using a
variety of quantitative metrics that are specified in the associated model
performance requirements. When integrating such models into aeronautical
applications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the
model performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values.
Often, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model
performance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an
example of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt
component (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first
describes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on
that abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum
safety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their
targets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they
meet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment
process. We give rationale as to why the proposed method should be considered
valid, also clarifying the assumptions made, the constraints on applicability,
and the implications for verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI的负责任发展对于防止意外后果至关重要，本研究旨在识别并优先考虑推动AI系统伦理发展的驱动因素。

Method: 本研究采用了多声文献综述（MLR）和问卷调查来捕捉伦理AI的当前实践，并应用解释性结构建模（ISM）探索驱动因素类别之间的关系，随后通过MICMAC分析对它们进行分类，最后使用模糊TOPSIS对这些驱动因素的重要性进行排名。

Result: 确定了20个关键驱动因素，分为8个类别：人力资源、知识整合、协调、项目管理、标准、技术因素、利益相关者以及战略与指标。ISM结果显示'人力资源'和'协调'对其他因素影响较大。MICMAC分析将人力资源（CA1）、协调（CA3）、利益相关者（CA7）和战略与指标（CA8）归为独立集群，表明这些类别具有高驱动但低依赖力。模糊TOPSIS将促进团队多样性、建立AI治理机构、任命监督领导者和确保数据隐私等驱动因素列为最关键。

Conclusion: 为了支持伦理AI的采用，组织应将这些驱动因素纳入其政策、治理模型和开发框架中。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents transformative opportunities for
industries and society, but its responsible development is essential to prevent
unintended consequences. Ethically sound AI systems demand strategic planning,
strong governance, and an understanding of the key drivers that promote
responsible practices. This study aims to identify and prioritize the
motivators that drive the ethical development of AI systems. A Multivocal
Literature Review (MLR) and a questionnaire-based survey were conducted to
capture current practices in ethical AI. We applied Interpretive Structure
Modeling (ISM) to explore the relationships between motivator categories,
followed by MICMAC analysis to classify them by their driving and dependence
power. Fuzzy TOPSIS was used to rank these motivators by importance. Twenty key
motivators were identified and grouped into eight categories: Human Resource,
Knowledge Integration, Coordination, Project Administration, Standards,
Technology Factor, Stakeholders, and Strategy & Matrices. ISM results showed
that 'Human Resource' and 'Coordination' heavily influence other factors.
MICMAC analysis placed categories like Human Resource (CA1), Coordination
(CA3), Stakeholders (CA7), and Strategy & Matrices (CA8) in the independent
cluster, indicating high driving but low dependence power. Fuzzy TOPSIS ranked
motivators such as promoting team diversity, establishing AI governance bodies,
appointing oversight leaders, and ensuring data privacy as most critical. To
support ethical AI adoption, organizations should align their strategies with
these motivators and integrate them into their policies, governance models, and
development frameworks.

Motivation: 技术社区（如GitHub）中的性别歧视和厌女行为严重阻碍包容性，导致开发者（尤其是少数群体）因微妙偏见和微侵犯而离开。现有审核工具依赖关键词过滤或二元分类器，难以有效检测 nuanced 伤害。

Method: 研究采用基于指令调优的大型语言模型（LLM）框架，通过20轮系统提示优化，对1,440条标记的GitHub评论进行十二类别性别歧视/厌女分类评估，并利用精确率、召回率、F1分数和马修斯相关系数（MCC）严格比较模型性能。

Result: 优化后的方法（GPT-4o搭配提示19）达到MCC 0.501，显著优于基线模型，但难以可靠解读依赖上下文的 nuanced 性别歧视和厌女内容。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示词结合清晰定义和结构化输出显著提升了性别歧视检测的准确性和可解释性，使得在开发者平台（如GitHub）上实现精准且实用的内容审核成为可能。

Abstract: Background: Sexist and misogynistic behavior significantly hinders inclusion
in technical communities like GitHub, causing developers, especially
minorities, to leave due to subtle biases and microaggressions. Current
moderation tools primarily rely on keyword filtering or binary classifiers,
limiting their ability to detect nuanced harm effectively.
  Aims: This study introduces a fine-grained, multi-class classification
framework that leverages instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to
identify twelve distinct categories of sexist and misogynistic comments on
GitHub.
  Method: We utilized an instruction-tuned LLM-based framework with systematic
prompt refinement across 20 iterations, evaluated on 1,440 labeled GitHub
comments across twelve sexism/misogyny categories. Model performances were
rigorously compared using precision, recall, F1-score, and the Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
  Results: Our optimized approach (GPT-4o with Prompt 19) achieved an MCC of
0.501, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. While this model had
low false positives, it struggled to interpret nuanced, context-dependent
sexism and misogyny reliably.
  Conclusion: Well-designed prompts with clear definitions and structured
outputs significantly improve the accuracy and interpretability of sexism
detection, enabling precise and practical moderation on developer platforms
like GitHub.

TL;DR: 研究探索用LLM（如CIgrate框架）提升CI配置迁移的自动化水平，对比规则基础的CIMig，验证LLM在准确性和通用性上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有规则基础的CI迁移工具（如CIMig）准确率低的问题，探索LLM在CI配置迁移中的潜力。

Method: 提出CIgrate框架，结合零样本/少样本提示和微调LLM的方法，与规则基础的CIMig进行对比评估。

Result: 预期贡献包括首个LLM驱动的CI迁移方法、与规则基础的对比评估，以及LLM在软件配置演化中的应用洞察。

Conclusion: LLM-based框架CIgrate在CI配置迁移中展现出潜力，有望提升自动化迁移的准确性和通用性，为软件配置演化提供新思路。

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) configurations often need to be migrated between
services (e.g., Travis CI to GitHub Actions) as projects evolve, due to changes
in service capabilities, usage limits, or service deprecation. Previous studies
reported that migration across CI services is a recurring need in open-source
development. However, manual migration can be time-consuming and error-prone.
The state-of-the-art approach, CIMig, addresses this challenge by analyzing
past migration examples to create service-specific rules and produce equivalent
configurations across CI services. However, its relatively low accuracy raises
concerns about the overall feasibility of automated CI migration using
rule-based techniques alone. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and transformation tasks,
suggesting potential to improve the automation, usability, and generalizability
of CI configuration migration. This registered report presents a study in which
we aim to assess whether CI migration can be improved using LLMs. To this end,
we propose CIgrate, an LLM-based framework for automatically migrating CI
configurations. We plan to evaluate the performance of CIgrate compared to
CIMig as a baseline, in different setups (a) zero-shot/few-shot prompting of
LLMs for configuration migration and (b) fine-tuning an LLM on a dataset of
already established CI service migrations. We will also seek developer feedback
on the quality and usability of the generated configurations. We formulate
research questions focusing on the accuracy of LLM-generated migrations versus
ground truth and the output of CIMig. The expected contributions include the
first LLM-powered approach for CI service migration, a comparative evaluation
of its effectiveness compared to rule-based approaches, and insight into
leveraging LLMs to support software configuration evolution.

Motivation: 软件测试常被视为重复性、低技能活动，忽视了其所需的创造力、问题解决能力和适应性。研究旨在揭示测试工作的真实挑战和体验。

Method: 通过研究软件测试专业人员，探讨了软件测试中具有挑战性的任务的性质及其对专业人员的影响。

Result: 研究结果表明，涉及创造力、持续学习及时间压力的任务常被视为激励和奖励；而缺乏挑战或过度需求则可能导致挫败感和脱离。

Conclusion: 研究强调了平衡任务复杂性以维持测试专业人员动机的重要性，并将软件测试呈现为一个动态且智力参与的领域。

Abstract: As software systems continue to grow in complexity, testing has become a
fundamental part of ensuring the quality and reliability of software products.
Yet, software testing is still often perceived, both in industry and academia,
as a repetitive, low-skill activity. This perception fails to recognize the
creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability required in testing work. Tasks
such as designing complex test cases, automating testing processes, and
handling shifting requirements illustrate the challenges testing professionals
regularly face. To better understand these experiences, we conducted a study
with software testing professionals to explore the nature of challenging tasks
in software testing and how they affect these professionals. Our findings show
that tasks involving creativity, ongoing learning, and time pressure are often
seen as motivating and rewarding. On the other hand, a lack of challenge or
overwhelming demands can lead to frustration and disengagement. These findings
demonstrate the importance of balancing task complexity to sustain motivation
and present software testing as a dynamic and intellectually engaging field.

Method: 通过引导突变策略系统性地引入现实任务描述缺陷，扩展HumanEval和MBPP基准，生成反映非正式开发者指令混乱的数据集，并评估不同规模和架构的LLMs在功能正确性和失败模式上的表现。

Result: 研究发现即使任务描述措辞的微小缺陷也会导致性能显著下降，矛盾描述导致大量逻辑错误；大模型虽更稳健，但仍受不清晰需求影响。

Conclusion: 论文强调了开发不仅强大且对自然用户任务固有缺陷具有鲁棒性的大型语言模型（LLMs）的迫切需求，提出了改进模型训练策略、设计更现实评估基准及确保在实际软件开发环境中可靠部署的重要考量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code
generation tasks under idealized conditions, where task descriptions are clear
and precise. However, in practice, task descriptions frequently exhibit
ambiguity, incompleteness, or internal contradictions. In this paper, we
present the first empirical study examining the robustness of state-of-the-art
code generation models when faced with such unclear task descriptions. We
extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by systematically introducing
realistic task descriptions flaws through guided mutation strategies, producing
a dataset that mirrors the messiness of informal developer instructions. We
evaluate multiple LLMs of varying sizes and architectures, analyzing their
functional correctness and failure modes across task descriptions categories.
Our findings reveal that even minor imperfections in task description phrasing
can cause significant performance degradation, with contradictory task
descriptions resulting in numerous logical errors. Moreover, while larger
models tend to be more resilient than smaller variants, they are not immune to
the challenges posed by unclear requirements. We further analyze semantic error
patterns and identify correlations between description clarity, model behavior,
and error types. Our results underscore the critical need for developing LLMs
that are not only powerful but also robust to the imperfections inherent in
natural user tasks, highlighting important considerations for improving model
training strategies, designing more realistic evaluation benchmarks, and
ensuring reliable deployment in practical software development environments.

Conclusion: 该论文的统计方法有效区分了量子软件错误与硬件噪声，为量子软件开发提供了可靠的分析工具。

Abstract: Quantum computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era presents
significant challenges in differentiating quantum software bugs from hardware
noise. Traditional debugging techniques from classical software engineering
cannot directly resolve this issue due to the inherently stochastic nature of
quantum computation mixed with noises from NISQ computers. To address this gap,
we propose a statistical approach leveraging probabilistic metrics to
differentiate between quantum software bugs and hardware noise. We evaluate our
methodology empirically using well-known quantum algorithms, including Grover's
algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Simon's algorithm. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach, providing
quantum software developers with a reliable analytical tool to identify and
classify unexpected behavior in quantum programs.

TL;DR: VDGraph是一种基于知识图谱的方法，整合SBOM和SCA数据，提供对软件依赖和漏洞的全面视图。实践验证表明，它能有效识别高风险点，并揭示漏洞传播规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件供应链的高复杂性需要工具（如SBOM和SCA）来管理组件依赖和识别漏洞。然而，SBOM和SCA工具之间的集成有限，缺乏对复杂依赖-漏洞关系的统一视图。

Method: 本文提出VDGraph，一种基于知识图谱的方法，整合SBOM和SCA工具的输出数据，形成软件项目的依赖和漏洞的图表示。通过形式化描述和分析VDGraph的理论特性，并提供解决SBOM和SCA数据冲突的方案。进一步实现了一个概念验证的VDGraph实现，并对其进行了评估。

Result: VDGraph成功应用于21个流行的Java项目，通过图查询揭示了高风险点（即通过多条依赖路径可达的高严重性漏洞组件）。此外，研究表明漏洞主要出现在三层或更深依赖层次，表明直接或次级依赖的漏洞密度较低且更安全。

Conclusion: VDGraph提出了一种基于知识图谱的方法，整合了SBOM和SCA工具的数据，提供了对软件项目中依赖和漏洞关系的全面视图。通过理论分析和实践验证，VDGraph揭示了复杂依赖关系中漏洞传播的规律，为实际项目中的可扩展和自动化分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: The high complexity of modern software supply chains necessitates tools such
as Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to manage component dependencies, and
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerabilities. While
there exists limited integration between SBOMs and SCA tools, a unified view of
complex dependency-vulnerability relationships remains elusive. In this paper,
we introduce VDGraph, a novel knowledge graph-based methodology for integrating
vulnerability and dependency data into a holistic view. VDGraph consolidates
SBOM and SCA outputs into a graph representation of software projects'
dependencies and vulnerabilities. We provide a formal description and analysis
of the theoretical properties of VDGraph and present solutions to manage
possible conflicts between the SBOM and SCA data. We further introduce and
evaluate a practical, proof-of-concept implementation of VDGraph using two
popular SBOM and SCA tools, namely CycloneDX Maven plugin and Google's
OSV-Scanner. We apply VDGraph on 21 popular Java projects. Through the
formulation of appropriate queries on the graphs, we uncover the existence of
concentrated risk points (i.e., vulnerable components of high severity
reachable through numerous dependency paths). We further show that
vulnerabilities predominantly emerge at a depth of three dependency levels or
higher, indicating that direct or secondary dependencies exhibit lower
vulnerability density and tend to be more secure. Thus, VDGraph contributes a
graph-theoretic methodology that improves visibility into how vulnerabilities
propagate through complex, transitive dependencies. Moreover, our
implementation, which combines open SBOM and SCA standards with Neo4j, lays a
foundation for scalable and automated analysis across real-world projects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成任务中的广泛应用，地理空间代码生成成为人工智能与地理科学分析融合的关键领域，亟需系统评估方法来衡量LLMs在地理空间环境中的生成能力。

Method: 提出了GeoJSEval，一个多模态、函数级别的自动评估框架，包含标准化测试套件（GeoJSEval-Bench）、代码提交引擎和评估模块，覆盖432个函数级任务和2,071个结构化测试用例。

Result: 对18个先进LLMs的综合评估揭示了在空间语义理解、代码可靠性和函数调用准确性方面的显著性能差异和瓶颈。

Conclusion: GeoJSEval 为标准化评估和优化地理空间代码生成模型提供了基础方法、评估资源和实用工具，具有强大的扩展性和实际场景适用性。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in code
generation tasks, geospatial code generation has emerged as a critical frontier
in the integration of artificial intelligence and geoscientific analysis. This
trend underscores the urgent need for systematic evaluation methodologies to
assess LLMs generation capabilities in geospatial contexts. In particular,
geospatial computation and visualization tasks in JavaScript environments rely
heavily on orchestrating diverse frontend libraries and ecosystems, placing
elevated demands on a model's semantic understanding and code synthesis
abilities. To address this challenge, we propose GeoJSEval--the first
multimodal, function-level automatic evaluation framework for LLMs in
JavaScript-based geospatial code generation. GeoJSEval comprises three core
components: a standardized test suite (GeoJSEval-Bench), a code submission
engine, and an evaluation module. It includes 432 function-level tasks and
2,071 structured test cases spanning five widely used JavaScript geospatial
libraries and 25 mainstream geospatial data types. GeoJSEval enables
multidimensional quantitative evaluation across metrics such as accuracy,
output stability, execution efficiency, resource consumption, and error type
distribution, and integrates boundary testing mechanisms to enhance robustness
and coverage. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs
using GeoJSEval, revealing significant performance disparities and bottlenecks
in spatial semantic understanding, code reliability, and function invocation
accuracy. GeoJSEval provides a foundational methodology, evaluation resource,
and practical toolkit for the standardized assessment and optimization of
geospatial code generation models, with strong extensibility and applicability
in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试生成技术往往仅关注代码覆盖率，忽略了开发者对特定行为的验证意图和项目特定知识，导致生成的测试难以通过代码审查。

Method: IntentionTest 将测试生成问题转化为针对验证意图的测试代码编辑问题，并生成包括测试前缀和断言的可执行测试。

Result: 在 13 个开源项目的 4,146 个测试案例中，IntentionTest 相比 ChatTester 生成语义正确测试的数量显著提升，常见变异分数提高 39.03%，覆盖率重叠提高 40.14%，通过率提升 21.30%。

Conclusion: IntentionTest 通过结构化描述生成具有验证意图的项目特定测试，显著提升了测试的语义正确性和通过率。

Abstract: Test cases are valuable assets for maintaining software quality. While
numerous automated techniques have been proposed for generating tests (either
by maximizing code coverage or by translating focal code into test code),
practical tests are seldom driven by coverage alone. In real projects, each
test reflects a developer's validation intention for a specific behaviour and
embodies rich, project-specific knowledge: which specific APIs to call and what
assertions truly matter. Without considering such knowledge, tests can hardly
pass code review and be integrated into the software product.
  In this work, we propose IntentionTest, which generates project-specific
tests with validation intention as a structured description. Our design is
motivated by two insights: (1) a description of validation intention, compared
to coverage and focal code, carries more crucial information about what to
test; and (2) practical tests exhibit high code duplication, indicating that
domain knowledge is highly reusable for writing new tests. Given a focal code
and a description of validation intention (in the form of either an informal
comment or a formal test plan), IntentionTest retrieves a referable test in the
project to guide test generation. Moreover, IntentionTest reduces the test
generation problem into an editing problem on the test code regarding the
validation intention. It generates a test including both test prefix and
oracle, which aims to be executable and semantically correct.
  We evaluate IntentionTest against state-of-the-art baselines on 4,146 test
cases from 13 open-source projects. Specifically, compared to ChatTester,
IntentionTest can (1) generate significantly more semantically correct tests,
improving common mutation scores by 39.03% and coverage overlap with
ground-truth tests by 40.14%; (2) generate 21.30% more successful passing
tests.

*Nima Karimipour,Michael Pradel,Martin Kellogg,Manu Sridharan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NullRepair 是一个结合 LLM 和静态分析的系统，用于自动化修复 Java 代码中的空指针错误，显著提高了修复效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代 Java 项目广泛采用静态分析工具来防止空指针异常，但将这些工具集成到大型现有代码库中仍面临挑战。手动修复错误既繁琐又容易出错，因此需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: NullRepair 的工作流程基于对 200 个真实错误的分析，采用静态分析识别符号的安全和非安全使用区域，并通过迭代式 LLM 交互生成补丁。

Result: 在 12 个真实 Java 项目上的评估显示，NullRepair 平均解决了 72% 的残留错误，且在 10/12 的项目中所有单元测试均通过，其余两个项目的测试通过率超过 98%。

Conclusion: NullRepair 是一种将大型语言模型（LLMs）集成到结构化工作流程中的系统，用于解决空指针检查器产生的错误。通过结合静态分析和项目范围的上下文，NullRepair 能够高效且准确地修复错误，同时保持程序语义的完整性。

Abstract: Modern Java projects increasingly adopt static analysis tools that prevent
null-pointer exceptions by treating nullness as a type property. However,
integrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant
challenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,
a subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives
-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing
these errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often
generate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability
error demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,
often spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system
that integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a
nullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived
from manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to
identify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage
examples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an
iterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and
decision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that
NullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying
a state-of-the-art annotation inference technique. Unlike a naively-prompted
LLM, NullRepair also largely preserves program semantics, with all unit tests
passing in 10/12 projects after applying every edit proposed by NullRepair, and
98% or more tests passing in the remaining two projects.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Gilesi 是一种 Java 框架，通过记录和比较 API 交互快照，有效检测库演进中的行为破坏性变更（BBCs），弥补传统客户端测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发严重依赖第三方库来加速开发并提高质量。然而，库的演进可能会通过引入行为破坏性变更（BBCs）打破与客户端建立的隐性合同，这些变更会改变运行时行为并无声地破坏客户端应用程序，而编译时无法检测到。传统的客户端回归测试由于库覆盖有限或断言不足，往往无法检测到这些 BBCs。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的客户端-库兼容性测试方法，通过记录客户端测试执行期间 API 边界的实际交互（协议、输入输出值、异常等），并将这些交互序列存储为快照。随着库的演变，比较原始和新快照以识别合同中的扰动，标记潜在的 BBCs 并通知客户端。该方法在原型工具 Gilesi 中实现，这是一个自动检测库 API、记录快照并进行比较的 Java 框架。

Result: 通过初步案例研究，在多个客户端-库对上人为植入 BBCs，结果表明 Gilesi 能够可靠地检测到客户端测试套件遗漏的 BBCs。

Conclusion: Gilesi 是一种有效的工具，能够可靠地检测传统客户端测试套件遗漏的行为破坏性变更（BBCs），从而帮助维护客户端与库之间的兼容性。

Abstract: Modern software development heavily relies on third-party libraries to speed
up development and enhance quality. As libraries evolve, they may break the
tacit contract established with their clients by introducing behavioral
breaking changes (BBCs) that alter run-time behavior and silently break client
applications without being detected at compile time. Traditional regression
tests on the client side often fail to detect such BBCs, either due to limited
library coverage or weak assertions that do not sufficiently exercise the
library's expected behavior. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach
to client--library compatibility testing that leverages existing client tests
in a novel way. Instead of relying on developer-written assertions, we propose
recording the actual interactions at the API boundary during the execution of
client tests (protocol, input and output values, exceptions, etc.). These
sequences of API interactions are stored as snapshots which capture the exact
contract expected by a client at a specific point in time. As the library
evolves, we compare the original and new snapshots to identify perturbations in
the contract, flag potential BBCs, and notify clients. We implement this
technique in our prototype tool Gilesi, a Java framework that automatically
instruments library APIs, records snapshots, and compares them. Through a
preliminary case study on several client--library pairs with artificially
seeded BBCs, we show that Gilesi reliably detects BBCs missed by client test
suites.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的基于搜索的软件测试生成技术，针对与MongoDB交互的RESTful API，通过动态分析数据库状态和直接从测试用例插入数据，显著提高了测试覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生成白盒测试时，考虑数据库状态对提高代码覆盖率和发现隐藏故障至关重要。

Method: 通过自动化代码插桩动态分析数据库状态，并在测试生成过程中直接从测试用例插入NoSQL数据。

Result: 在六个RESTful API上的实验显示，新技术显著提高了代码覆盖率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的新技术显著提高了RESTful API与NoSQL数据库交互时的测试覆盖率，实验结果显示比现有白盒方法提升了高达18%。

Abstract: In RESTful APIs, interactions with a database are a common and crucial
aspect. When generating whitebox tests, it is essential to consider the
database's state (i.e., the data contained in the database) to achieve higher
code coverage and uncover more hidden faults. This article presents novel
techniques to enhance search-based software test generation for RESTful APIs
interacting with NoSQL databases. Specifically, we target the popular MongoDB
database, by dynamically analyzing (via automated code instrumentation) the
state of the database during the test generation process. Additionally, to
achieve better results, our novel approach allows inserting NoSQL data directly
from test cases. This is particularly beneficial when generating the correct
sequence of events to set the NoSQL database in an appropriate state is
challenging or time-consuming. This method is also advantageous for testing
read-only microservices. Our novel techniques are implemented as an extension
of EvoMaster, the only open-source tool for white-box fuzzing RESTful APIs.
Experiments conducted on six RESTful APIs demonstrated significant improvements
in code coverage, with increases of up to 18% compared to existing white-box
approaches. To better highlight the improvements of our novel techniques,
comparisons are also carried out with four state-of-the-art black-box fuzzers.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过构建API使用示例和语义描述来提升代码补全准确率的方法，实验证明其显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在代码补全中难以有效利用未显式导入的内部API信息，影响了补全准确性。

Method: 提出了一种无需依赖导入即可推断内部API信息的方法，通过构建API使用示例和语义描述扩展API表示，并建立知识库供LLMs生成相关补全。同时引入了ProjBench基准测试。

Result: 在ProjBench和CrossCodeEval上，代码精确匹配率提升22.72%，标识符精确匹配率提升18.31%；与现有基线结合后，代码匹配率提升47.80%，标识符匹配率提升35.55%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过构建API使用示例和语义描述，显著提升了代码补全的准确率，尤其是在处理未显式导入的API时。实验结果表明，该方法在ProjBench和CrossCodeEval基准测试中优于现有方法，且与现有基线结合后效果更佳。

Abstract: Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context
from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and
project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to
incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially
when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.
  To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information
without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by
constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge
base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a
benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world
projects.
  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by
22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our
method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match
by 35.55%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在自动化漏洞修复中的优异表现是否由隐藏因素（如训练数据泄漏或完美故障定位）驱动。

Method: 研究采用控制实验，通过在提示中故意添加错误来改变漏洞位置，利用两个LLMs（一个生成补丁，一个审查补丁）进行修复，并通过回归和漏洞验证测试验证结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs在漏洞修复中的表现可能依赖于记忆而非真正的修复能力。

Conclusion: 研究发现，LLMs在自动化漏洞修复中的表现可能受到训练数据泄漏等隐藏因素的影响，而非其真正的修复能力。

Abstract: Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of
program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs)
outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code
generation and fault detection.
  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- "invisible hands"
such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM
reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.
  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by
deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the
prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large
localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because
any offset should divert the model from the original fix.
  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans
benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.
A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the
result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually
audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in discrete
action spaces by eliminating value function dependencies through group-based
advantage estimation. However, its application to continuous control remains
unexplored, limiting its utility in robotics where continuous actions are
essential. This paper presents a theoretical framework extending GRPO to
continuous control environments, addressing challenges in high-dimensional
action spaces, sparse rewards, and temporal dynamics. Our approach introduces
trajectory-based policy clustering, state-aware advantage estimation, and
regularized policy updates designed for robotic applications. We provide
theoretical analysis of convergence properties and computational complexity,
establishing a foundation for future empirical validation in robotic systems
including locomotion and manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: RARLAP框架通过结构化奖励增强，显著提升了自主停车的适应性、训练速度和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规则和模型预测方法缺乏适应性和泛化能力，无法处理自主停车中的非线性和环境依赖性复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种奖励增强的学习框架（RARLAP），利用结构化奖励设计在Unity高保真3D模拟环境中训练。

Result: 实验证明，基于里程碑增强奖励（MAR）的策略实现了91%的成功率，轨迹更平滑且行为更鲁棒。

Conclusion: RARLAP框架通过奖励增强有效解决了复杂自主停车挑战，实现了可扩展且高效的政策优化。

Abstract: Autonomous parking (AP) represents a critical yet complex subset of
intelligent vehicle automation, characterized by tight spatial constraints,
frequent close-range obstacle interactions, and stringent safety margins.
However, conventional rule-based and model-predictive methods often lack the
adaptability and generalization needed to handle the nonlinear and
environment-dependent complexities of AP. To address these limitations, we
propose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates
the inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured
reward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely
within a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We
systematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only
reward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward
(MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization
paradigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a
91\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior,
while GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory
analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability,
accelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall,
RARLAP establishes that reward augmentation effectively addresses complex
autonomous parking challenges, enabling scalable and efficient policy
optimization with both on- and off-policy methods. To support reproducibility,
the code accompanying this paper is publicly available.

TL;DR: GABRIL利用人类注视数据改进模仿学习，显著提升性能并增强可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习（IL）经常受到因果混淆的困扰，导致在测试环境中性能下降。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了利用人类注视数据来改进IL的方法。

Method: GABRIL引入了一种基于人类注视数据的正则化损失，鼓励模型关注因果相关特征，从而减少混杂变量的影响。

Result: 在Atari和CARLA环境中，GABRIL相比行为克隆分别提高了179%和76%的性能。

Conclusion: GABRIL通过利用人类注视数据来引导模仿学习中的表示学习，显著提高了在新测试环境中的性能，并提供了额外的可解释性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to
learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised
learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents
misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor
performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this
issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a
novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data
collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a
regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant
features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects
of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and
the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and
applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the
improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same
number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we
show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL
agents.

Conclusion: RAKOMO通过结合K-Order Markov Optimization（KOMO）和基于可达性裕度的运动规划方法，成功解决了四足机器人操纵器的运动规划问题，并在仿真实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Legged manipulators, such as quadrupeds equipped with robotic arms, require
motion planning techniques that account for their complex kinematic constraints
in order to perform manipulation tasks both safely and effectively. However,
trajectory optimization methods often face challenges due to the hybrid
dynamics introduced by contact discontinuities, and tend to neglect leg
limitations during planning for computational reasons. In this work, we propose
RAKOMO, a path optimization technique that integrates the strengths of K-Order
Markov Optimization (KOMO) with a kinematically-aware criterion based on the
reachable region defined as reachability margin. We leverage a neural-network
to predict the margin and optimize it by incorporating it in the standard KOMO
formulation. This approach enables rapid convergence of gradient-based motion
planning -- commonly tailored for continuous systems -- while adapting it
effectively to legged manipulators, successfully executing loco-manipulation
tasks. We benchmark RAKOMO against a baseline KOMO approach through a set of
simulations for pick-and-place tasks with the HyQReal quadruped robot equipped
with a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of future agent trajectories is a critical challenge for
ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation, particularly in complex
urban environments characterized by multiple plausible future scenarios. In
this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that integrates learning-based
with physics-based constraints to address the multi-modality inherent in
trajectory prediction. Our method employs a variational Bayesian mixture model
to effectively capture the diverse range of potential future behaviors, moving
beyond traditional unimodal assumptions. Unlike prior approaches that
predominantly treat trajectory prediction as a data-driven regression task, our
framework incorporates physical realism through sector-specific boundary
conditions and Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based smoothing. These
constraints ensure that predicted trajectories are not only data-consistent but
also physically plausible, adhering to kinematic and dynamic principles.
Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse trajectory
predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in
autonomous driving systems. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Comprehensive
ablation studies validate the contributions of each component and highlight
their synergistic impact on prediction accuracy and reliability. By balancing
data-driven insights with physics-informed constraints, our approach offers a
robust and scalable solution for navigating the uncertainties of real-world
urban environments.

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于PPO训练的自适应退化优化代理（DOA）有效解决了SLAM在长直走廊等室内环境中的退化问题。通过设计专门的奖励函数和转移学习模块，DOA在退化检测和优化能力上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Particle filter-based 2D-SLAM is widely used in indoor localization tasks due
to its efficiency. However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors
can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent
(DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to
address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning
frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2)
inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in
annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide
the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments.
Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can
dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization.
Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model
distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula
related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning
module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different
environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate
environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also
compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy
detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for utilizing skin sensors as a new
operation interface of complex robots. The skin sensors employed in this study
possess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple
contact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is
anticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions
exhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot
motion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by
altering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this
paper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing
recurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success
of this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for
software-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive
encoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy
and learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to
the classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to
mount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the
activation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of
measuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation
with other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated
by the robot's movements during deployment. Through these discoveries, the
accuracy of the developed classifier surpassed 95 %, enabling the dual-arm
mobile manipulator to execute a diverse range of tasks via the Skin-Machine
Interface. https://youtu.be/UjUXT4Z4BC8

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation, fundamental to human daily activities, remains a
challenging task due to its inherent complexity of coordinated control. Recent
advances have enabled zero-shot learning of single-arm manipulation skills
through agent-agnostic visual representations derived from human videos;
however, these methods overlook crucial agent-specific information necessary
for bimanual coordination, such as end-effector positions. We propose Ag2x2, a
computational framework for bimanual manipulation through coordination-aware
visual representations that jointly encode object states and hand motion
patterns while maintaining agent-agnosticism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Ag2x2 achieves a 73.5% success rate across 13 diverse bimanual tasks from
Bi-DexHands and PerAct2, including challenging scenarios with deformable
objects like ropes. This performance outperforms baseline methods and even
surpasses the success rate of policies trained with expert-engineered rewards.
Furthermore, we show that representations learned through Ag2x2 can be
effectively leveraged for imitation learning, establishing a scalable pipeline
for skill acquisition without expert supervision. By maintaining robust
performance across diverse tasks without human demonstrations or engineered
rewards, Ag2x2 represents a step toward scalable learning of complex bimanual
robotic skills.

Abstract: 4D imaging radar is a type of low-cost millimeter-wave radar(costing merely
10-20$\%$ of lidar systems) capable of providing range, azimuth, elevation, and
Doppler velocity information. Accurate extrinsic calibration between
millimeter-wave radar and camera systems is critical for robust multimodal
perception in robotics, yet remains challenging due to inherent sensor noise
characteristics and complex error propagation. This paper presents a systematic
calibration framework to address critical challenges through a spatial 3d
uncertainty-aware PnP algorithm (3DUPnP) that explicitly models spherical
coordinate noise propagation in radar measurements, then compensating for
non-zero error expectations during coordinate transformations. Finally,
experimental validation demonstrates significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art CPnP baseline, including improved consistency in simulations
and enhanced precision in physical experiments. This study provides a robust
calibration solution for robotic systems equipped with millimeter-wave radar

Abstract: In many applications, robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured and
natural environments where they encounter various types of vegetation.
Vegetation presents unique challenges as a traversable obstacle, where the
mechanical properties of the plants can influence whether a robot can safely
collide with and overcome the obstacle. A more nuanced approach is required to
assess the safety and traversability of these obstacles, as collisions can
sometimes be safe and necessary for navigating through dense or unavoidable
vegetation. This paper introduces a novel sensor designed to directly measure
the applied forces exerted by vegetation on a robot: by directly capturing the
push-back forces, our sensor provides a detailed understanding of the
interactions between the robot and its surroundings. We demonstrate the
sensor's effectiveness through experimental validations, showcasing its ability
to measure subtle force variations. This force-based approach provides a
quantifiable metric that can inform navigation decisions and serve as a
foundation for developing future learning algorithms.

Conclusion: PlaneHEC通过创新的计算模型设计，实现了通用且快速的手眼标定，为多智能体系统和具身智能的发展做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Hand-eye calibration is an important task in vision-guided robotic systems
and is crucial for determining the transformation matrix between the camera
coordinate system and the robot end-effector. Existing methods, for multi-view
robotic systems, usually rely on accurate geometric models or manual
assistance, generalize poorly, and can be very complicated and inefficient.
Therefore, in this study, we propose PlaneHEC, a generalized hand-eye
calibration method that does not require complex models and can be accomplished
using only depth cameras, which achieves the optimal and fastest calibration
results using arbitrary planar surfaces like walls and tables. PlaneHEC
introduces hand-eye calibration equations based on planar constraints, which
makes it strongly interpretable and generalizable. PlaneHEC also uses a
comprehensive solution that starts with a closed-form solution and improves it
withiterative optimization, which greatly improves accuracy. We comprehensively
evaluated the performance of PlaneHEC in both simulated and real-world
environments and compared the results with other point-cloud-based calibration
methods, proving its superiority. Our approach achieves universal and fast
calibration with an innovative design of computational models, providing a
strong contribution to the development of multi-agent systems and embodied
intelligence.

Conclusion: The T-A-L框架通过闭环循环显著提升了机器人在动态环境中的适应性和任务完成率，为开发更自主、鲁棒的机器人代理提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current
systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners,
rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in
dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that
enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through
continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an
LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.
The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal
sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to
facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal
analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are
stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We
demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world
that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including
open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our
framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks,
converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits
remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant
step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic
agents.

TL;DR: A novel distributed framework for multi-agent trajectory planning effectively reduces deadlocks in dense environments by combining global homotopy-aware path planning with local trajectory optimization, achieving over 90% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deadlocks in multi-agent trajectory planning, especially in dense environments, pose significant challenges to safety and efficiency, necessitating a novel approach to bridge global path and local trajectory cooperation.

Method: The framework combines a homotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm at the global level with a model predictive control-based trajectory optimization method at the local level, supplemented by an online replanning strategy.

Result: Simulations and experiments show the approach reduces deadlocks and improves the average success rate from 4%-13% to over 90% in dense scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed distributed trajectory planning framework effectively mitigates deadlocks in obstacle-dense environments, significantly improving coordination and success rates among agents.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory planning requires ensuring both safety and efficiency,
yet deadlocks remain a significant challenge, especially in obstacle-dense
environments. Such deadlocks frequently occur when multiple agents attempt to
traverse the same long and narrow corridor simultaneously. To address this, we
propose a novel distributed trajectory planning framework that bridges the gap
between global path and local trajectory cooperation. At the global level, a
homotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm is proposed, which fully
leverages the topological structure of the environment. A reference path is
chosen from distinct homotopy classes by considering both its spatial and
temporal properties, leading to improved coordination among agents globally. At
the local level, a model predictive control-based trajectory optimization
method is used to generate dynamically feasible and collision-free
trajectories. Additionally, an online replanning strategy ensures its
adaptability to dynamic environments. Simulations and experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in mitigating deadlocks. Ablation studies
demonstrate that by incorporating time-aware homotopic properties into the
underlying global paths, our method can significantly reduce deadlocks and
improve the average success rate from 4%-13% to over 90% in randomly generated
dense scenarios.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个无需编程知识的交互式场景生成框架，旨在降低仿真验证的门槛，使其对非技术用户更加友好和可访问。

Abstract: Autonomous driving promises safer roads, reduced congestion, and improved
mobility, yet validating these systems across diverse conditions remains a
major challenge. Real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes
unsafe, making large-scale validation impractical. In contrast, simulation
environments offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative for rigorous
verification and validation. A critical component of the validation process is
scenario generation, which involves designing and configuring traffic scenarios
to evaluate autonomous systems' responses to various events and uncertainties.
However, existing scenario generation tools often require programming
knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. To address this
limitation, we present an interactive, no-code framework for scenario
generation. Our framework features a graphical interface that enables users to
create, modify, save, load, and execute scenarios without needing coding
expertise or detailed simulation knowledge. Unlike script-based tools such as
Scenic or ScenarioRunner, our approach lowers the barrier to entry and supports
a broader user base. Central to our framework is a graph-based scenario
representation that facilitates structured management, supports both manual and
automated generation, and enables integration with deep learning-based scenario
and behavior generation methods. In automated mode, the framework can randomly
sample parameters such as actor types, behaviors, and environmental conditions,
allowing the generation of diverse and realistic test datasets. By simplifying
the scenario generation process, this framework supports more efficient testing
workflows and increases the accessibility of simulation-based validation for
researchers, engineers, and policymakers.

TL;DR: 新型神经形态相机触觉传感器实现了快速、高精度的3D重建，扫描速度比现有方法快11倍，误差更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉触觉传感器在大面积扫描时速度受限，且存在摩擦、磨损和运动模糊等问题。因此，需要一种快速、连续、高分辨率的方法。

Method: 采用神经形态相机和滚动机制结合的触觉传感器，利用事件驱动的多视角立体视觉方法进行3D重建，并结合多参考贝叶斯融合策略提升精度。

Result: 系统实现了高达0.5 m/s的扫描速度，平均绝对误差低于100微米，比现有连续触觉传感方法快11倍，并通过贝叶斯融合策略进一步降低误差25.2%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新型触觉传感器，通过整合神经形态相机和滚动机制，实现了快速、连续、高分辨率的3D重建，显著提升了扫描速度和精度。

Abstract: Inspecting large-scale industrial surfaces like aircraft fuselages for
quality control requires capturing their precise 3D surface geometry at high
resolution. Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) offer high local resolution
but require slow 'press-and-lift' measurements stitched for large areas.
Approaches with sliding or roller/belt VBTS designs provide measurements
continuity. However, they face significant challenges respectively: sliding
struggles with friction/wear and both approaches are speed-limited by
conventional camera frame rates and motion blur, making large-area scanning
time consuming. Thus, a rapid, continuous, high-resolution method is needed. We
introduce a novel tactile sensor integrating a neuromorphic camera in a rolling
mechanism to achieve this. Leveraging its high temporal resolution and
robustness to motion blur, our system uses a modified event-based multi-view
stereo approach for 3D reconstruction. We demonstrate state-of-the-art scanning
speeds up to 0.5 m/s, achieving Mean Absolute Error below 100 microns -- 11
times faster than prior continuous tactile sensing methods. A multi-reference
Bayesian fusion strategy enhances accuracy (reducing MAE by 25.2\% compared to
EMVS) and mitigates curvature errors. We also validate high-speed feature
recognition via Braille reading 2.6 times faster than previous approaches.

Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing
limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion
framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human
inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network
(FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features
and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained
as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language
using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched
expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated
greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results
demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled
uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot
sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot
collaborative task performance.

Abstract: AI technologies, including deep learning, large-language models have gone
from one breakthrough to the other. As a result, we are witnessing growing
excitement in robotics at the prospect of leveraging the potential of AI to
tackle some of the outstanding barriers to the full deployment of robots in our
daily lives. However, action and sensing in the physical world pose greater and
different challenges than analysing data in isolation. As the development and
application of AI in robotic products advances, it is important to reflect on
which technologies, among the vast array of network architectures and learning
models now available in the AI field, are most likely to be successfully
applied to robots; how they can be adapted to specific robot designs, tasks,
environments; which challenges must be overcome. This article offers an
assessment of what AI for robotics has achieved since the 1990s and proposes a
short- and medium-term research roadmap listing challenges and promises. These
range from keeping up-to-date large datasets, representatives of a diversity of
tasks robots may have to perform, and of environments they may encounter, to
designing AI algorithms tailored specifically to robotics problems but generic
enough to apply to a wide range of applications and transfer easily to a
variety of robotic platforms. For robots to collaborate effectively with
humans, they must predict human behavior without relying on bias-based
profiling. Explainability and transparency in AI-driven robot control are not
optional but essential for building trust, preventing misuse, and attributing
responsibility in accidents. We close on what we view as the primary long-term
challenges, that is, to design robots capable of lifelong learning, while
guaranteeing safe deployment and usage, and sustainable computational costs.

Conclusion: CLASP通过语义关键点实现了对不同衣物类型和任务的通用操作，表现出色且具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability
for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain
limited to specific tasks and clothes types, due to the complex,
high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation
with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes
manipulation over different clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long
dresses, ... , as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, ... .
The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., ''left sleeve'', ''right
shoulder'', etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient
for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably
extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate
representation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints
to bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high
level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the
semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a
simple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments
show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks
across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four
distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's
performance on a real robot.

Abstract: Construction throughout history typically assumes that its blueprints and
building blocks are pre-determined. However, recent work suggests that
alternative approaches can enable new paradigms for structure formation.
Aleatory architectures, or those which rely on the properties of their granular
building blocks rather than pre-planned design or computation, have thus far
relied on human intervention for their creation. We imagine that robotic swarms
could be valuable to create such aleatory structures by manipulating and
forming structures from entangled granular materials. To discover principles by
which robotic systems can effectively manipulate soft matter, we develop a
robophysical model for interaction with geometrically cohesive granular media
composed of u-shape particles. This robotic platform uses environmental signals
to autonomously coordinate excavation, transport, and deposition of material.
We test the effect of substrate initial conditions by characterizing robot
performance in two different material compaction states and observe as much as
a 75% change in transported mass depending on initial substrate compressive
loading. These discrepancies suggest the functional role that material
properties such as packing and cohesion/entanglement play in excavation and
construction. To better understand these material properties, we develop an
apparatus for tensile testing of the geometrically cohesive substrates, which
reveals how entangled material strength responds strongly to initial
compressive loading. These results explain the variation observed in robotic
performance and point to future directions for better understanding robotic
interaction mechanics with entangled materials.

Conclusion: SuperMag方法通过结合高分辨率视觉触觉传感器数据，显著提升了磁基触觉传感器的空间分辨率，为高精度机器人任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Magnetic-based tactile sensors (MBTS) combine the advantages of compact
design and high-frequency operation but suffer from limited spatial resolution
due to their sparse taxel arrays. This paper proposes SuperMag, a tactile shape
reconstruction method that addresses this limitation by leveraging
high-resolution vision-based tactile sensor (VBTS) data to supervise MBTS
super-resolution. Co-designed, open-source VBTS and MBTS with identical contact
modules enable synchronized data collection of high-resolution shapes and
magnetic signals via a symmetric calibration setup. We frame tactile shape
reconstruction as a conditional generative problem, employing a conditional
variational auto-encoder to infer high-resolution shapes from low-resolution
MBTS inputs. The MBTS achieves a sampling frequency of 125 Hz, whereas the
shape reconstruction sustains an inference time within 2.5 ms. This
cross-modality synergy advances tactile perception of the MBTS, potentially
unlocking its new capabilities in high-precision robotic tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在对象目标导航中提升规划能力的实际贡献程度。

Method: 首先，简化了InstructNav，移除了动态导航链提示、开放词汇GLEE检测器和Intuition显著性图，替换为简单的距离加权前沿探索器（DWFE）。其次，添加了一个轻量级语言先验（SHF）。

Result: DWFE将成功率从58.0%提升至61.1%，SPL从20.9%提升至36.0%。SHF进一步提升了2%的成功率和0.9%的SPL，同时平均缩短路径五步。

Conclusion: 前沿几何（而非新兴的LLM推理）驱动了大多数报告的增益，表明在将导航成功归功于"LLM智能"之前，需要具备度量感知的提示或离线语义图。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often credited with recent leaps in
ObjectGoal Navigation, yet the extent to which they improve planning remains
unclear. We revisit this question on the HM3D-v1 validation split. First, we
strip InstructNav of its Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation prompt, open-vocabulary
GLEE detector and Intuition saliency map, and replace them with a simple
Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE). This geometry-only heuristic raises
Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and lifts SPL from 20.9% to 36.0% over 2 000
validation episodes, outperforming all previous training-free baselines.
Second, we add a lightweight language prior (SHF); on a 200-episode subset this
yields a further +2% Success and +0.9% SPL while shortening paths by five steps
on average. Qualitative trajectories confirm the trend: InstructNav back-tracks
and times-out, DWFE reaches the goal after a few islands, and SHF follows an
almost straight route. Our results indicate that frontier geometry, not
emergent LLM reasoning, drives most reported gains, and suggest that
metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are necessary before
attributing navigation success to "LLM intelligence."

Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying
(FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and
must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is
challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a
verification and validation (V&V) process that bridges simulation and
real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified,
end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and
hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin
includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the
GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space
Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for
Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to
validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated
multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper
introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error
characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and
robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning
pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The
results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic
twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for
realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations enable the accurate description and
analysis of the movement of biological systems with applications such as
rehabilitation assessment, prosthesis, and exoskeleton design. However, the
widespread usage of these techniques is limited by costly sensors,
laboratory-based setups, computationally demanding processes, and the use of
diverse software tools that often lack seamless integration. In this work, we
address these limitations by proposing an integrated, real-time framework for
musculoskeletal modeling and simulations that leverages OpenSimRT, the robotics
operating system (ROS), and wearable sensors. As a proof-of-concept, we
demonstrate that this framework can reasonably well describe inverse kinematics
of both lower and upper body using either inertial measurement units or
fiducial markers. Additionally, we show that it can effectively estimate
inverse dynamics of the ankle joint and muscle activations of major lower limb
muscles during daily activities, including walking, squatting and sit to stand,
stand to sit when combined with pressure insoles. We believe this work lays the
groundwork for further studies with more complex real-time and wearable
sensor-based human movement analysis systems and holds potential to advance
technologies in rehabilitation, robotics and exoskeleton designs.

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers
introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to
specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based
representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for
humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information
essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we
present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception
system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition
devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced
multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding
both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic
environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and
navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome
issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective

occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable
benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The
network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal
information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid
Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and

Abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in clinical examinations due
to its portability, real-time capability, and radiation-free nature. To address
inter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained
increasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal
imaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation
method within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we
explore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib
structures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone
surface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related
signals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic
noise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile
point cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human
palpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,
the sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a
denser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an
image-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping
for individual patients. Additionally, to ensure full coverage of the object of
interest, we introduce an automated tilt angle adjustment method to visualize
structures beneath the bone. To validate the proposed method, we conducted
comprehensive experiments on four distinct phantoms. The final scanning
waypoint mapping achieved Mean Nearest Neighbor Distance (MNND) and Hausdorff
distance (HD) errors of 3.41 mm and 3.65 mm, respectively, while the
reconstructed object beneath the bone had errors of 0.69 mm and 2.2 mm compared
to the CT ground truth.

Abstract: Decentralized multi-agent navigation under uncertainty is a complex task that
arises in numerous robotic applications. It requires collision avoidance
strategies that account for both kinematic constraints, sensing and action
execution noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the
Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) with a probabilistic adaptation of
Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance. Our method ensures safe and efficient
multi-agent navigation by incorporating probabilistic safety constraints
directly into the MPPI sampling process via a Second-Order Cone Programming
formulation. This approach enables agents to operate independently using local
noisy observations while maintaining safety guarantees. We validate our
algorithm through extensive simulations with differential-drive robots and
benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods, including ORCA-DD and B-UAVC.
Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms them while achieving high
success rates, even in densely populated environments. Additionally, validation
in the Gazebo simulator confirms its practical applicability to robotic
platforms.

Abstract: Robotic platforms have become essential for marine operations by providing
regular and continuous access to offshore assets, such as underwater
infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and resource exploration.
However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments,
characterized by limited visibility, unpredictable currents, and communication
constraints, presents significant challenges that demand advanced autonomy
while ensuring operator trust and oversight. Central to addressing these
challenges are knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, particularly
knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, that enable
robots to efficiently structure, retrieve, and interpret complex environmental
data. These capabilities empower robotic agents to reason, adapt, and respond
effectively to changing conditions. The primary goal of this work is to
demonstrate both multi-agent autonomy and shared autonomy, where multiple
robotic agents operate independently while remaining connected to a human
supervisor. We show how a RAG-powered large language model, augmented with
knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, enables autonomous multi-agent
decision-making and facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, resulting in
100\% mission validation and behavior completeness. Finally, ablation studies
reveal that without structured knowledge from the graph and/or taxonomy, the
LLM is prone to hallucinations, which can compromise decision quality.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation of quadrupedal robots has broadened robotic applications,
but using legs as manipulators often compromises locomotion, while mounting
arms complicates the system. To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism
for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions
with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind
legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this
inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is
dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the
coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive
experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over
baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates
the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle
probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging
dynamics and external disturbances.

Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained increasing attention in recent years, as a safe
environment to accelerate the development of motion planning and control
methods for autonomous driving. Deep learning models, predominantly based on
neural networks (NNs), have demonstrated significant potential in modeling the
vehicle dynamics and in performing various tasks in autonomous driving.
However, their black-box nature is critical in the context of autonomous
racing, where safety and robustness demand a thorough understanding of the
decision-making algorithms. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
MS-NN-steer, a new Model-Structured Neural Network for vehicle steering
control, integrating the prior knowledge of the nonlinear vehicle dynamics into
the neural architecture. The proposed controller is validated using real-world
data from the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) competition, with
full-scale autonomous race cars. In comparison with general-purpose NNs,
MS-NN-steer is shown to achieve better accuracy and generalization with small
training datasets, while being less sensitive to the weights' initialization.
Also, MS-NN-steer outperforms the steering controller used by the A2RL winning
team. Our implementation is available open-source in a GitHub repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习物理交互技能是代理在人类环境中的基本挑战，尤其是当代理的形态与演示者显著不同时。现有方法通常依赖手工制作的目标或形态相似性，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 引入了一个框架，通过提取称为嵌入式交互图（EIG）的紧凑、可转移的交互动态表示，并用作模仿目标来训练控制策略。

Result: 在多种代理（如人类、四足机器人或移动机械臂）和交互场景（如格斗、握手、石头剪刀布或跳舞）中验证了BuddyImitation的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了一种通过跨形态交互学习实现形态不同角色间协调行为的有前景的路径。

Abstract: Learning physical interaction skills, such as dancing, handshaking, or
sparring, remains a fundamental challenge for agents operating in human
environments, particularly when the agent's morphology differs significantly
from that of the demonstrator. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted
objectives or morphological similarity, limiting their capacity for
generalization. Here, we introduce a framework that enables agents with diverse
embodiments to learn wholebbody interaction behaviors directly from human
demonstrations. The framework extracts a compact, transferable representation
of interaction dynamics, called the Embedded Interaction Graph (EIG), which
captures key spatiotemporal relationships between the interacting agents. This
graph is then used as an imitation objective to train control policies in
physics-based simulations, allowing the agent to generate motions that are both
semantically meaningful and physically feasible. We demonstrate BuddyImitation
on multiple agents, such as humans, quadrupedal robots with manipulators, or
mobile manipulators and various interaction scenarios, including sparring,
handshaking, rock-paper-scissors, or dancing. Our results demonstrate a
promising path toward coordinated behaviors across morphologically distinct
characters via cross embodiment interaction learning.

Motivation: 现有研究多集中于高级任务如任务分解，少数探索LLMs在反馈控制器设计的应用，但局限于简化系统、固定结构增益调整且缺乏实际验证。为进一步探索LLMs在自动控制中的应用，本研究聚焦于自适应控制这一关键子领域。

Conclusion: 本研究为LLMs在自动控制领域的新应用方向开辟了道路，相比视觉语言模型，具有更强的可部署性和实用性。

Abstract: With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work
focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have
explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts
are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and
lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,
this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework
of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive
compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,
the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a
reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the
unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.
Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided
adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive
control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world
environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms
traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity
compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and
reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator
enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical
derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,
adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying
LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and
practicality compared to vision-language models.

Abstract: The unification of disparate maps is crucial for enabling scalable robot
operation across multiple sessions and collaborative multi-robot scenarios.
However, achieving a unified map robust to sensor modalities and dynamic
environments remains a challenging problem. Variations in LiDAR types and
dynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene
consistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure
detection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging
framework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,
dynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A
voxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify
and reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal
module is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved
static local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic
environments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are
conducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a
centralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during
map merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph
optimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for
globally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse
real-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing
superior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping
in dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing
methods. Project Page: https://sparolab.github.io/research/uni_mapper.

Abstract: Reticular structures form the backbone of major infrastructure like bridges,
pylons, and airports, but their inspection and maintenance are costly and
hazardous, often requiring human intervention. While prior research has focused
on fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous
navigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study
addresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss
structures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces
several approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus
background from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into
two categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical
approach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the
eigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced
deep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3
are trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that
the analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance
comparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally
intensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves
a Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the
promise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous
navigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs
between computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing
valuable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous
infrastructure inspection and maintenance.

Abstract: Visual imitation learning (VIL) provides an efficient and intuitive strategy
for robotic systems to acquire novel skills. Recent advancements in foundation
models, particularly Vision Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in visual and linguistic reasoning for VIL tasks.
Despite this progress, existing approaches primarily utilize these models for
learning high-level plans from human demonstrations, relying on pre-defined
motion primitives for executing physical interactions, which remains a major
bottleneck for robotic systems. In this work, we present FMimic, a novel
paradigm that harnesses foundation models to directly learn generalizable
skills at even fine-grained action levels, using only a limited number of human
videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FMimic delivers strong
performance with a single human video, and significantly outperforms all other
methods with five videos. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant
improvements of over 39% and 29% in RLBench multi-task experiments and
real-world manipulation tasks, respectively, and exceeds baselines by more than
34% in high-precision tasks and 47% in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Situationally-aware artificial agents operating with competence in natural
environments face several challenges: spatial awareness, object affordance
detection, dynamic changes and unpredictability. A critical challenge is the
agent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its
objectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for
reactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object
recognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as
optical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system
is grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic
knowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to
create queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer
entities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of
reasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for
normal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved
in particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to
autonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to
recognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible
by focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach
in a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects
involved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle
initially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it
learns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able
to plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation. This underscores
the agent's capability to expand its knowledge through observation in a
systematic way, and illustrates the potential of combining deep reasoning

Conclusion: 该论文提出的新型框架通过整合认知过程建模方法，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆（AV）与行人交互的安全性和效率，证明了其在复杂多智能体交互环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown
impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road
users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in
interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex
multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on
crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to
AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic
boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed
behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling
interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a
cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is
integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic
interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk
Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused
measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like
trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a
dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a
Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and
informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework
effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation
compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: 本文提出的不确定性感知MCTS算法通过结合模型不确定性估计，显著提升了在不确定性条件下的规划可靠性，尤其在数据有限的情况下表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Physics-based simulations and learning-based models are vital for complex
robotics tasks like deformable object manipulation and liquid handling.
However, these models often struggle with accuracy due to epistemic uncertainty
or the sim-to-real gap. For instance, accurately pouring liquid from one
container to another poses challenges, particularly when models are trained on
limited demonstrations and may perform poorly in novel situations. This paper
proposes an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm designed
to mitigate these inaccuracies. By incorporating estimates of model
uncertainty, the proposed MCTS strategy biases the search towards actions with
lower predicted uncertainty. This approach enhances the reliability of planning
under uncertain conditions. Applied to a liquid pouring task, our method
demonstrates improved success rates even with models trained on minimal data,
outperforming traditional methods and showcasing its potential for robust
decision-making in robotics.

Abstract: To facilitate the wider adoption of robotics, accessible programming tools
are required for non-experts. Observational learning enables intuitive human
skills transfer through hands-on demonstrations, but relying solely on visual
input can be inefficient in terms of scalability and failure mitigation,
especially when based on a single demonstration. This paper presents a
human-in-the-loop method for enhancing the robot execution plan, automatically
generated based on a single RGB video, with natural language input to a Large
Language Model (LLM). By including user-specified goals or critical task
aspects and exploiting the LLM common-sense reasoning, the system adjusts the
vision-based plan to prevent potential failures and adapts it based on the
received instructions. Experiments demonstrated the framework intuitiveness and
effectiveness in correcting vision-derived errors and adapting plans without
requiring additional demonstrations. Moreover, interactive plan refinement and
hallucination corrections promoted system robustness.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel hybrid approach for vision-only navigation of
mobile robots, which combines advances of both deep learning approaches and
classical model-based planning algorithms. Today, purely data-driven end-to-end
models are dominant solutions to this problem. Despite advantages such as
flexibility and adaptability, the requirement of a large amount of training
data and limited interpretability are the main bottlenecks for their practical
applications. To address these limitations, we propose a hierarchical system
that utilizes recent advances in model predictive control, traversability
estimation, visual place recognition, and pose estimation, employing
topological graphs as a representation of the target environment. Using such a
combination, we provide a scalable system with a higher level of
interpretability compared to end-to-end approaches. Extensive real-world
experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method.

### [326] [Fully Dynamic Spectral and Cut Sparsifiers for Directed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19632)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态有向图谱稀疏化方法，保持了顶点度平衡，并在多项指标上实现了高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态有向图的谱和割稀疏化算法，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入了一种称为度平衡保持谱近似的新概念，测量与无向拉普拉斯矩阵的近似误差。针对欧拉图和部分对称图设计了高效的动态算法。

Result: 算法实现了$O(ε^{-2} \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$的摊销更新时间和$O(ε^{-2} n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$的稀疏化大小。此外，针对部分对称图和β-平衡有向图也提出了高效算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的有向图谱稀疏化方法，保持了顶点入度和出度的差异，并在欧拉图中实现了直接的欧拉谱近似。算法在动态更新和稀疏化大小方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent years have seen extensive research on directed graph sparsification.
In this work, we initiate the study of fast fully dynamic spectral and cut
sparsification algorithms for directed graphs.
  We introduce a new notion of spectral sparsification called degree-balance
preserving spectral approximation, which maintains the difference between the
in-degree and out-degree of each vertex. The approximation error is measured
with respect to the corresponding undirected Laplacian. This notion is
equivalent to direct Eulerian spectral approximation when the input graph is
Eulerian. Our algorithm achieves an amortized update time of
$O(\varepsilon^{-2} \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$ and produces a sparsifier of size
$O(\varepsilon^{-2} n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$. Additionally, we present an
algorithm that maintains a constant-factor approximation sparsifier of size
$O(n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$ against an adaptive adversary for
$O(\text{polylog}(n))$-partially symmetrized graphs, a notion introduced in
[Kyng-Meierhans-Probst Gutenberg '22]. A $\beta$-partial symmetrization of a
directed graph $\vec{G}$ is the union of $\vec{G}$ and $\beta \cdot G$, where
$G$ is the corresponding undirected graph of $\vec{G}$. This algorithm also
achieves a polylogarithmic amortized update time.
  Moreover, we develop a fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining a cut
sparsifier for $\beta$-balanced directed graphs, where the ratio between
weighted incoming and outgoing edges of any cut is at most $\beta$. This
algorithm explicitly maintains a cut sparsifier of size
$O(\varepsilon^{-2}\beta n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$ in worst-case update time
$O(\varepsilon^{-2}\beta \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在对抗性环境下管理可重用资源的在线分配问题，旨在开发具有理论保证的算法。

Method: 对于kRental-Fixed，采用基于价格的分数分配方法并结合无损在线舍入方案；对于kRental-Variable，提出有限相关舍入技术并结合精心设计的基于价格的方法。

Result: kRental-Fixed问题中实现了最优竞争比的随机算法；kRental-Variable问题中通过有限相关舍入技术实现了接近最优的竞争比。

Conclusion: 论文为两种在线资源分配问题（kRental-Fixed和kRental-Variable）提供了理论支持的算法，分别通过不同的松弛-舍入方法实现了最优或有竞争力的竞争比。

Abstract: We study two online resource-allocation problems with reusability in an
adversarial setting, namely kRental-Fixed and kRental-Variable. In both
problems, a decision-maker manages $k$ identical reusable units and faces a
sequence of rental requests over time. We develop theoretically grounded
relax-and-round algorithms with provable competitive-ratio guarantees for both
settings. For kRental-Fixed, we present an optimal randomized algorithm that
attains the best possible competitive ratio: it first computes an optimal
fractional allocation via a price-based approach, then applies a novel lossless
online rounding scheme to obtain an integral solution. For kRental-Variable, we
prove that lossless online rounding is impossible. We introduce a
limited-correlation rounding technique that treats each unit independently
while introducing controlled dependencies across allocation decisions involving
the same unit. Coupled with a carefully crafted price-based method for
computing the fractional allocation, this yields an order-optimal competitive
ratio for the variable-duration setting.

TL;DR: 论文改进了Dor等人的近似最短路径算法，将顶点对距离限制从$k$降至$O(\log k)$，同时保持$\tilde{O}(n^{2+\frac{1}{k}})$的时间复杂度。当$k=\log n$时，时间复杂度优化至$\tilde{O}(n^2)$。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dor等人的算法在25年内未有显著改进，论文旨在突破这一限制，提供更优的近似最短路径计算方法。

Method: 结合组合和随机化技术，提出了一种新的算法，能够在更短的顶点对距离限制下高效运行。

Result: 算法在$\tilde{O}(n^{2+\frac{1}{k}})$时间复杂度下，适用于顶点对仅$O(\log k)$距离的情况，显著优于之前的结果。当$k=\log n$时，时间复杂度降至$\tilde{O}(n^2)$。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种改进的近似最短路径算法，显著降低了顶点对之间的距离限制要求，同时保持了原有的时间复杂度。

Abstract: An influential result by Dor, Halperin, and Zwick (FOCS 1996, SICOMP 2000)
implies an algorithm that can compute approximate shortest paths for all vertex
pairs in $\tilde{O}(n^{2+O\left(\frac{1}{k}\right )})$ time, ensuring that the
output distance is at most twice the actual shortest path, provided the pairs
are at least $k$ apart, where $k \ge 2$. We present the first improvement on
this result in over 25 years. Our algorithm achieves roughly same
$\tilde{O}(n^{2+\frac{1}{k}})$ runtime but applies to vertex pairs merely
$O(\log k)$ apart, where $\log k \ge 1$. When $k=\log n$, the running time of
our algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and it works for all pairs at least $O(\log
\log n)$ apart. Our algorithm is combinatorial, randomized, and returns correct
results for all pairs with a high probability.

Motivation: 现有的基准实例通常不可满足或解的数量较少，难以有效评估解决SRI硬变体的方法。

Method: 引入了一种新算法来生成具有大量解的SRI基准实例。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新算法，用于生成具有大量解的SRI基准实例，这些实例难以通过枚举所有稳定匹配来找到平等主义稳定匹配。

Abstract: While the existence of a stable matching for the stable roommates problem
possibly with incomplete preference lists (SRI) can be decided in polynomial
time, SRI problems with some fairness criteria are intractable. Egalitarian SRI
that tries to maximize the total satisfaction of agents if a stable matching
exists, is such a hard variant of SRI. For experimental evaluations of methods
to solve these hard variants of SRI, several well-known algorithms have been
used to randomly generate benchmark instances. However, these benchmark
instances are not always satisfiable, and usually have a small number of stable
matchings if one exists. For such SRI instances, despite the NP-hardness of
Egalitarian SRI, it is practical to find an egalitarian stable matching by
enumerating all stable matchings. In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm
to generate benchmark instances for SRI that have very large numbers of
solutions, and for which it is hard to find an egalitarian stable matching by
enumerating all stable matchings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的NC算法，用于低维度下非单调链接函数的(1+ε)近似HAC，并证明了在任意维度下这类算法的不可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非单调链接函数（如质心和Ward距离）在高效并行算法上的缺失问题。

Method: 基于结构结果，提出了一种高效的NC算法，用于在低维度下进行(1+ε)近似HAC。

Result: 证明了在低维度下，这类链接函数的HAC层次高度最多为poly(logn)，且NC算法存在；但在任意维度下，这类算法不太可能存在。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在低维度下，一类非单调链接函数（包括质心和Ward距离）的高效NC算法存在，但在任意维度下，这类算法的存在性不太可能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is an extensively studied and
widely used method for hierarchical clustering in $\mathbb{R}^k$ based on
repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters according to an input linkage
function $d$. Highly parallel (i.e., NC) algorithms are known for
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC (where near-minimum rather than minimum pairs
are merged) for certain linkage functions that monotonically increase as merges
are performed. However, no such algorithms are known for many important but
non-monotone linkage functions such as centroid and Ward's linkage.
  In this work, we show that a general class of non-monotone linkage functions
-- which include centroid and Ward's distance -- admit efficient NC algorithms
for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC in low dimensions. Our algorithms are based
on a structural result which may be of independent interest: the height of the
hierarchy resulting from any constant-approximate HAC on $n$ points for this
class of linkage functions is at most $\operatorname{poly}(\log n)$ as long as
$k = O(\log \log n / \log \log \log n)$. Complementing our upper bounds, we
show that NC algorithms for HAC with these linkage functions in
\emph{arbitrary} dimensions are unlikely to exist by showing that HAC is
CC-hard when $d$ is centroid distance and $k = n$.

Abstract: Adaptive binary search trees are a fundamental data structure for organizing
hierarchical information. Their ability to dynamically adjust to access
patterns makes them particularly valuable for building responsive and efficient
networked and distributed systems.
  We present a unified framework for adaptive binary search trees with fixed
restructuring cost, analyzed under two models: the single-source model, where
the cost of querying a node is proportional to its distance from a fixed
source, and the all-to-all model, where the cost of serving a request depends
on the distance between the source and destination nodes. We propose an offline
algorithm for the single-source model and extend it to the all-to-all model.
For both models, we prove upper bounds on the cost incurred by our algorithms.
Furthermore, we show the existence of input sequences for which any offline
algorithm must incur a cost comparable to ours.
  In the online setting, we develop a general mathematical framework for
deterministic online adaptive binary search trees and propose a deterministic
online strategy for the single-source case, which naturally extends to the
all-to-all model. We also establish lower bounds on the competitive ratio of
any deterministic online algorithm, highlighting fundamental limitations of
online adaptivity.

*Noga Klein Elmalem,Rica Gonen,Erel Segal-Halevi*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper explores minimizing envy in apartment redistribution by framing it as a combinatorial optimization problem, finding it solvable in polynomial time without preexisting conditions but leaving the general case open.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of fairly redistributing apartments in a rebuilt building to minimize envy among residents, considering both new assignments and preexisting conditions.

Method: The paper reduces the apartment redistribution problem to a combinatorial optimization problem called the *Min Max Average Cycle Weight* problem, which involves assigning objects to agents to minimize the maximum average weight of directed cycles in an envy graph.

Result: The study shows that while the problem reduces to maximum-weight matching (and thus polynomial-time solvability) when starting from a clean slate, this is not the case when preexisting conditions are considered.

Conclusion: The problem of fairly redistributing apartments to minimize envy among residents remains an open question in the general case, especially when accounting for preexisting conditions like residents' satisfaction with their original apartments.

Abstract: When an old apartment building is demolished and rebuilt, how can we fairly
redistribute the new apartments to minimize envy among residents? We reduce
this question to a combinatorial optimization problem called the *Min Max
Average Cycle Weight* problem. In that problem we seek to assign objects to
agents in a way that minimizes the maximum average weight of directed cycles in
an associated envy graph. While this problem reduces to maximum-weight matching
when starting from a clean slate (achieving polynomial-time solvability), we
show that this is not the case when we account for preexisting conditions, such
as residents' satisfaction with their original apartments. Whether the problem
is polynomial-time solvable in the general case remains an intriguing open
problem.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Winnow2算法的新方法，首次显著改进了学习k-term DNF公式的效率，将时间复杂度降至poly(n)⋅2^Õ(√k)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自1992年Blum和Rudich提出算法以来，虽有多种算法能达到类似的运行时间，但尚未有显著改进。本文旨在通过新方法和技术突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用Winnow2算法在增强的特征空间上学习线性阈值函数，结合了[BR92]中的技术强化和多种新工具（如低权重线性阈值函数的属性高效学习算法、junta测试中的相关变量查找技术）及分析成分（极值多项式和噪声算子）。

Result: 新算法将学习k-term DNF公式的时间复杂度从poly(n,2^k)提升至poly(n)⋅2^Õ(√k)，实现了显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的算法，显著提高了学习k-term DNF公式的效率，这是自Blum和Rudich [BR92]以来的首次改进。

Abstract: In 1992 Blum and Rudich [BR92] gave an algorithm that uses membership and
equivalence queries to learn $k$-term DNF formulas over $\{0,1\}^n$ in time
$\textsf{poly}(n,2^k)$, improving on the naive $O(n^k)$ running time that can
be achieved without membership queries [Val84]. Since then, many alternative
algorithms [Bsh95, Kus97, Bsh97, BBB+00] have been given which also achieve
runtime $\textsf{poly}(n,2^k)$.
  We give an algorithm that uses membership and equivalence queries to learn
$k$-term DNF formulas in time $\textsf{poly}(n) \cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k})}$.
This is the first improvement for this problem since the original work of Blum
and Rudich [BR92].
  Our approach employs the Winnow2 algorithm for learning linear threshold
functions over an enhanced feature space which is adaptively constructed using
membership queries. It combines a strengthened version of a technique that
effectively reduces the length of DNF terms from the original work of [BR92]
with a range of additional algorithmic tools (attribute-efficient learning
algorithms for low-weight linear threshold functions and techniques for finding
relevant variables from junta testing) and analytic ingredients (extremal
polynomials and noise operators) that are novel in the context of query-based
DNF learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Gomory-Hu树构建算法时间复杂度较高（nm^{1+o(1)}），本文旨在提出一种几乎最优的确定性算法（m^{1+o(1)}时间），填补这一领域的空白。

Method: 通过两个新颖的组件：1) 从全对最小割问题到单源最小割问题的确定性减少，仅引入次多项式开销；2) 确定性几乎线性时间单源最小割算法。

Result: 首次实现了几乎最优的m^{1+o(1)}时间确定性算法，适用于构建Gomory-Hu树及解决k-边连通分量等更简单问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种几乎最优的确定性算法，用于构建Gomory-Hu树，解决了长期以来该问题的时间复杂度瓶颈。

Abstract: Given an $m$-edge, undirected, weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$, a Gomory-Hu tree
$T$ (Gomory and Hu, 1961) is a tree over the vertex set $V$ such that all-pairs
mincuts in $G$ are preserved exactly in $T$.
  In this article, we give the first almost-optimal $m^{1+o(1)}$-time
deterministic algorithm for constructing a Gomory-Hu tree. Prior to our work,
the best deterministic algorithm for this problem dated back to the original
algorithm of Gomory and Hu that runs in $nm^{1+o(1)}$ time (using current
maxflow algorithms). In fact, this is the first almost-linear time
deterministic algorithm for even simpler problems, such as finding the
$k$-edge-connected components of a graph.
  Our new result hinges on two separate and novel components that each
introduce a distinct set of de-randomization tools of independent interest:
  - a deterministic reduction from the all-pairs mincuts problem to the
single-souce mincuts problem incurring only subpolynomial overhead, and
  - a deterministic almost-linear time algorithm for the single-source mincuts
problem.

Abstract: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in
entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization,
volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and
interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have
gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant
challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and
high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we
introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.
Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D
Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.
This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to
changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer
functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality
images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare
it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event
estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space
radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly
enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while
maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D
reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and
historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the
immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which
remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we
draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use
unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for
understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we
extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel
framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo
collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the
same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance
field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language
feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the
multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,
we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance
language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively
compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,
to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark
dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained
photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling
applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries,
architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

Conclusion: ChoreoMuse通过其扩散框架和MotionTune音乐编码器，成功实现了高质量、风格可控的舞蹈视频生成，适用于多种音乐风格和舞者特性，展现了在创意应用中的广泛潜力。

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography
generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer
characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance
videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography
styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To
address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that
uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries
between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints
imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports
style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical
genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to
handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel
music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the
generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the
input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match
both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that
measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments
confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style
adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of
creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page:

Abstract: Gaussian splatting techniques have shown promising results in novel view
synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high
reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of
primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of
geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a
neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information
around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric
representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture
features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this
disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail
reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using

Motivation: 传统注塑模具设计依赖专家经验，耗时且成本高。该研究旨在开发一种无需专家干预的方法，通过智能算法自动确定最佳注射点位置，从而降低成本并提高效率。

Method: 论文首先通过计算离散模型中每个三角形面的质心来确定模型的质心，以确保熔融塑料在模具腔填充时的均匀分布。随后，两个子算法智能评估几何形状和最佳注射点位置：第一个子算法基于二维节点积分生成几何矩阵，第二个子算法将节点矩阵和相关圆形区域沿脱模方向正交投影到零件表面。最佳注射点位置通过最小化与第一个算法结果的质心距离来确定。

Result: 通过六个复杂几何案例的流变学模拟验证，该方法实现了熔融塑料的均匀分布，并在填充阶段实现了最小压力损失。验证结果表明，该方法超越了现有技术水平，为数字双胞胎应用提供了灵活的选择。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种创新的方法，通过智能模型和几何算法确定注塑零件的注射点位置，有效减少了专家干预需求，降低了成本，并适用于多种设计环境和虚拟双胞胎系统。

Abstract: This article presents an innovative methodology for locating injection points
in injection-molded parts using intelligent models with geometric algorithms
for discrete topologies. The first algorithm calculates the center of mass of
the discrete model based on the center of mass of each triangular facet in the
system, ensuring uniform molten plastic distribution during mold cavity
filling. Two sub-algorithms intelligently evaluate the geometry and optimal
injection point location. The first sub-algorithm generates a geometric matrix
based on a two-dimensional nodal quadrature adapted to the part's bounding box.
The second sub-algorithm projects the nodal matrix and associated circular
areas orthogonally on the part's surface along the demolding direction. The
optimal injection point location is determined by minimizing the distance to
the center of mass from the first algorithm's result. This novel methodology
has been validated through rheological simulations in six case studies with
complex geometries. The results demonstrate uniform and homogeneous molten
plastic distribution with minimal pressure loss during the filling phase.
Importantly, this methodology does not require expert intervention, reducing
time and costs associated with manual injection mold feed system design. It is
also adaptable to various design environments and virtual twin systems, not
tied to specific CAD software. The validated results surpass the state of the
art, offering an agile alternative for digital twin applications in new product
design environments, reducing dependence on experts, facilitating designer
training, and ultimately cutting costs
