Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个多模态数据集，用于支持基于可穿戴惯性测量单元（IMU）的运动质量评估和机器学习模型开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发稳健的传感器分类模型需要大规模多样化的数据集，但现有数据集的收集成本高且耗时。

Method: 通过19名参与者记录同步的IMU和光学标记动作捕捉数据，提供原始和处理后的数据、OpenSim模型、逆向动力学结果及可视化工具。

Result: 数据集支持机器学习模型开发，用于自动运动评估、步态分析、时间活动分割和生物力学参数估计。

Conclusion: 该资源旨在加速机器学习驱动的人类运动分析研究，并提供代码以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BF-PIP是一种零样本行人意图预测方法，通过处理连续视频片段和上下文信息，显著提升了预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖于帧序列的监督学习且需大量重新训练，难以适应新场景。BF-PIP旨在通过零样本方法解决这一问题。

Method: BF-PIP是一种基于Gemini 2.5 Pro的零样本方法，直接从富含JAAD元数据的连续视频片段中推断行人意图，并结合边界框注释和自车速度的多模态提示。

Result: BF-PIP在无需额外训练的情况下，预测准确率达到73%，比GPT-4V基线方法高18%。

Conclusion: BF-PIP通过结合连续视频片段和上下文线索，显著提升了行人意图预测的准确性，为智能交通系统提供了无需重新训练的敏捷感知模块。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

### [3] [VoluMe -- Authentic 3D Video Calls from Live Gaussian Splat Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21311)
*Martin de La Gorce,Charlie Hewitt,Tibor Takacs,Robert Gerdisch,Zafiirah Hosenie,Givi Meishvili,Marek Kowalski,Thomas J. Cashman,Antonio Criminisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单个2D网络摄像头实时预测3D高斯重建的方法，实现了高质量且真实的3D视频会议，无需复杂硬件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟3D会议相比标准2D视频通话能增强共在感和参与度，但现有3D表示方法依赖复杂硬件或固定外观，不适合视频会议应用。因此，需要一种既能实时运行又高质量的3D表示方法。

Method: 提出了一种实时从单个2D网络摄像头预测3D高斯重建的方法，通过独立处理每一帧视频并引入稳定性损失，确保重建结果既忠实于输入视频，又在时间上保持稳定。

Result: 该方法在视觉质量和稳定性指标上优于现有方法，并在仅使用标准2D摄像头和显示器的情况下成功应用于实时一对一3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了从单个2D网络摄像头实时预测3D高斯重建，不仅实时且真实，还能忠实于输入视频。通过独立处理每一帧视频，重建结果在视觉质量和稳定性方面均优于现有方法，展示了在仅使用标准2D摄像头和显示器的情况下进行一对一3D会议的可能性。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

*Danglu Yang,Liang Zhang,Zihao Yue,Liangyu Chen,Yichen Xu,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态图表编辑范式Chart$	ext{M}^3$，通过视觉和语言结合提升编辑精度，微调MLLMs效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖自然语言指令，模糊性高，难以支持细粒度图表编辑。

Method: 引入多模态图表编辑新范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器，构建Chart$	ext{M}^3$基准和训练集Chart$	ext{M}^3$-Train。

Result: 基准揭示了当前MLLMs的局限性，微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 论文提出了Chart$	ext{M}^3$基准和多模态监督的重要性，微调MLLMs在数据集上显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究使用DCGAN和WGANGP生成牙科全景X光片，解决了数据稀缺问题。模型在细节和清晰度之间存在权衡，为未来牙科GAN应用提供了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题，探索生成对抗网络（GAN）在合成牙科全景X光片中的应用。

Method: 研究使用了深度卷积生成对抗网络（DCGAN）和Wasserstein损失函数与梯度惩罚（WGANGP），在2322张不同质量的牙科全景X光片上进行训练。预处理和数据清理步骤旨在标准化输入同时保留解剖变异性。探索了四种候选模型，通过改变批评器迭代次数、特征深度和训练前的去噪处理。

Result: 生成的X光片在解剖可视化和真实性方面表现中等，部分图像因伪影而质量下降。未经去噪数据训练的模型在细节（如下颌管和小梁骨）上表现更好，而去噪数据训练的模型在整体图像清晰度和锐度上更优。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来在牙科成像中基于GAN的方法奠定了基础，展示了在细节保留和图像清晰度之间的权衡。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

### [6] [On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21246)
*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于HMLNs的解释框架，用于增强图像描述模型中深度神经网络的可解释性，通过量化训练数据中影响标题生成的关键示例，为模型解释提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在多模态任务（如图像描述）中取得了显著进展，但其如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示以生成有意义标题的解释仍是一个挑战。标准性能评估方法通常依赖于与人工编写标题的比较，无法深入揭示这种整合机制。

Method: 论文使用HMLNs结合符号规则和实值函数，通过学习训练实例的HMLN分布并推断在生成样本条件下的分布变化，从而识别影响标题生成的关键训练示例。

Result: 通过在多个最先进的图像描述模型上进行的实验，论文展示了所提解释框架的可解释性，并允许从可解释性维度对这些模型进行比较。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLNs）的新型解释框架，能够量化训练数据中哪些示例对生成特定标题提供了更丰富的信息，从而增强了深度神经网络在图像描述任务中的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种半监督时空动作定位方法，通过双引导网络提升伪边界框选择效果，性能优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习在图像分类中已展现出潜力，但在时空动作定位中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入双引导网络，结合帧级分类和边界框预测，以增强动作类别在帧和边界框之间的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA数据集上评估，模型性能显著优于基于图像的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的双引导网络在半监督时空动作定位中显著提升了模型性能，尤其在标注数据有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

*Christopher Indris,Raiyan Rahman,Goetz Bramesfeld,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过分块增强技术比较了三种目标检测器在野生动物追踪中的性能，发现在计算资源有限的情况下，简单模型也能高效完成小目标检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空中野生动物追踪对保护工作至关重要，但面临技术挑战：有人驾驶飞机成本高、风险大且干扰性强；自主无人机计算能力有限，难以支持复杂的机载AI系统。小目标检测本身就是一个具有挑战性的计算机视觉子领域，且需兼顾计算效率。

Method: 本文通过应用分块增强技术对数据集进行处理，并在不同设置下研究了三种架构不同的常见目标检测器的性能。通过调整分块方法的超参数与检测精度进行对比研究。

Result: 每个模型在至少一种分块配置下达到了至少93%的mAP@IoU=0.5。统计分析深入探讨了各种因素的影响，并表明更快速、更简单的模型在此任务中与计算需求更高的模型效果相当，且在有限的分块尺度下表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在计算资源有限的情况下，使用简单的模型也能有效完成空中野生动物追踪的小目标检测任务，这为无人机的实际部署提供了可行性。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

### [9] [HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261)
*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LDM的新方法，通过ERP卷积填充和PanoDiT架构减少环境贴图的失真和伪影，实验证明其在质量和准确性上与现有最优方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的ERP表示在环境贴图估计中存在极点和边界的失真问题，影响了光照反射表面的真实感。本文旨在通过改进的模型架构和填充技术解决这些问题。

Method: 论文采用了潜在扩散模型（LDM）作为基础框架，提出了ERP卷积填充技术以减少边界伪影，并设计了全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）来优化ERP格式下的扩散网络。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的方法在标准基准测试中表现优异，生成的环境贴图在图像质量和光照准确性上与现有最优方法相当，尽管PanoDiT在图像质量上有所妥协。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视角图像估计高动态范围（HDR）环境贴图，并通过改进的ERP卷积填充和全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）减少了传统ERP表示中的失真和伪影。尽管PanoDiT在图像质量和合理性方面有所牺牲，但实验表明，该方法在图像质量和光照准确性上均与现有最优方法竞争。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了六种CLIP-based模型在胸部X光分类中的公平性和鲁棒性，发现年龄差异导致性能差距，其他属性表现较公平。模型依赖虚假相关性，且可视化技术评估存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP-based模型在自然图像-文本领域表现优异，但其在医疗任务（尤其是放射学）中的公平性和鲁棒性尚未充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本研究评估了六种广泛使用的CLIP-based模型，在三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14和NEATX）上进行胸部X光分类任务。评估内容包括模型在六种条件下的公平性，以及基于年龄、性别和种族的患者亚组分析。此外，还通过评估有无胸腔引流管的气胸病例来测试模型对捷径学习的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型在不同年龄患者间存在性能差距，但在性别和种族上表现较为公平。所有模型在没有胸腔引流管的图像上表现较差，表明依赖虚假相关性。敏感属性可从嵌入中分类，但PCA未显示此类模式。

Conclusion: 研究表明，CLIP-based模型在不同年龄患者间存在性能差异，但在其他属性上表现较为公平。所有模型在没有胸腔引流管的图像上表现较差，表明存在对虚假相关性的依赖。敏感属性可以从嵌入中分类，但PCA未显示此类模式，揭示了评估模型时可视化技术的局限性。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code
is available at https://github.com/TheoSourget/clip_cxr_fairness

TL;DR: GLCP框架通过全局和局部连通性保护的结合，显著提升了管状结构分割的准确性和连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局拓扑结构的约束，而忽略了局部不连续区域，导致分割结果不理想。

Method: 提出了一个全局到局部连通性保护（GLCP）框架，包括交互式多头分割（IMS）模块和基于双注意力的轻量级细化（DAR）模块。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上的实验表明，GLCP在管状结构分割中实现了更高的准确性和连续性。

Conclusion: GLCP框架通过全局和局部连通性保护的结合，显著提升了管状结构分割的准确性和连续性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at
https://github.com/FeixiangZhou/GLCP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过添加修饰语测试VLMs处理违反Grice准则的能力，发现其表现下降，揭示了模型局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉语言模型（VLMs）是否能够像人类一样处理违反Grice会话准则的情况，以揭示其认知能力的局限性。

Method: 研究通过在VQA v2.0数据集的人类 crafted 问题中添加修饰语，分析GPT-4o、Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Gemini-1.5-Flash三种先进VLMs的响应。

Result: VLMs在面对修饰问题时表现一致下降，表明其在处理复杂会话时的局限性。

Conclusion: 初步结果表明，VLMs在应对违反Grice会话准则的修饰问题时表现下降，这为理解VLMs的局限性提供了新方向。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出深度学习MRI重建框架，结合初始重建、深度配准和Transformer增强，显著提升重建质量和速度，适用于临床。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间长导致成本增加和患者不适，现有方法需要耗时配准先前的扫描。

Method: 提出了一种由初始重建网络、深度配准模型和基于Transformer的增强网络组成的深度学习MRI重建框架。

Result: 在纵向T1加权MRI数据集上验证了方法的优越性（p < 0.05），并在下游脑分割任务中提高了准确性和体积一致性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的新型MRI重建框架，显著提高了重建质量并减少了总重建时间，适用于实时临床应用。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Motivation: 现有方法在构建BEV表示时忽略了环境上下文信息，导致对物理世界特征的感知不全面。

Method: 提出了一种多任务学习框架CoP，包括生成密集占据地面真值（LDO）、体素高度引导采样（VHS）策略和全局-局部协作特征融合（CFF）模块。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，CoP达到了49.5% mAP和59.2% NDS的性能，优于现有视觉框架。

Conclusion: CoP框架通过多任务学习和特征融合，显著提升了基于视觉的鸟瞰图3D物体检测性能，证明了其在空间表示和特征细化方面的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time
field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in
conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and

Motivation: 解决领域泛化语义分割中因域偏移导致的模型性能下降问题，现有方法忽视潜在域先验，导致结果不理想。

Method: PDAF包含三个模块：潜在先验提取器（LPE）预测域偏移，域补偿模块（DCM）调整特征表示，扩散先验估计器（DPE）通过扩散过程估计潜在域先验。

Conclusion: PDAF通过引入潜在域先验和扩散建模，显著提升了语义分割模型在未见领域的泛化能力，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

Motivation: 从2D俯视图生成沉浸式360度室内全景图在虚拟现实、室内设计、房地产和机器人技术中有广泛应用，但由于缺乏明确的3D结构且需要几何一致性和照片级真实感，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: Top2Pano 是一种端到端模型，通过估计体积占用率推断3D结构，并使用体积渲染生成粗略的颜色和深度全景图，然后通过基于 ControlNet 的扩散模型细化阶段增强真实感和结构保真度。

Conclusion: Top2Pano 展示了在将俯视图与沉浸式室内合成相结合方面的潜力，能够有效重建几何结构、遮挡和空间布局。

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

Motivation: 解决现有基于MLLM的方法需要指令跟随数据且评估耗时、训练困难的问题，提升文本到图像生成的自动评估效率。

Method: 提出了LLaVA-Reward模型，直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，并通过SkipCA模块增强视觉与文本表示的双向交互。支持多种偏好数据微调。

Result: LLaVA-Reward在文本图像对齐、保真度/伪影、安全性和整体排名四个评估视角上表现优异，生成与人类评分一致的自动评估结果。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward通过引入Skip-connection Cross Attention模块和多视角评估，显著提升了文本到图像生成的自动评估效率和质量，优于传统和基于MLLM的方法。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

TL;DR: ReGATE is an adaptive token pruning method for MLLM training, using a teacher-student framework to reduce computational cost by 41% while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational cost of training MLLMs increases with token count, and existing efficiency methods focus on inference with limited training benefits. ReGATE addresses this gap by optimizing token usage during training.

Method: ReGATE uses a teacher-student framework with a frozen reference LLM as the teacher to compute per-token reference losses, combined with an EMA of the student's difficulty scores for adaptive token pruning.

Result: ReGATE accelerates training up to 2x faster, uses only 35% of tokens, and reduces total token count by over 41%, while matching or surpassing baseline performance.

Conclusion: ReGATE significantly reduces computational overhead while matching or surpassing baseline performance on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating MLLM training.

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

Motivation: 传统地图构建模型仅提供确定性点估计，无法捕捉现实世界环境中的不确定性和固有模糊性（如遮挡和缺失车道标记）。

Method: MapDiffusion采用扩散范式，通过迭代优化随机初始化的查询，生成多个可能的地图样本，从而学习向量化地图的完整分布。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，MapDiffusion在在线地图构建中达到最先进性能，单样本性能提升5%，且多样本聚合进一步提升了ROC曲线性能。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整的地图分布，增强了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，为自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策提供了支持。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Conclusion: DuCiSC框架通过双重跨图像语义一致性学习，有效解决了半监督医学图像分割中的特征不一致问题，并在多个数据集上展示了优于现有方法的分割效果。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces RVI and ALG techniques to improve VLN by focusing on visual transitions and semantic layouts, achieving better performance than current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN agents struggle with overly detailed scene representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, leading to behaviors that violate linguistic commands. This paper aims to enhance linguistic grounding and navigation decisions by addressing these issues.

Method: The paper proposes a navigation policy using Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques to focus on visual transitions and semantic layouts, and Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) for fine-grained semantic matching between situational memories and linguistic commands.

Result: The proposed navigation policy shows superior performance on VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Our navigation policy, incorporating RVI and ALG techniques, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks, demonstrating superior performance in VLN.

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 论文提出的自监督数据集蒸馏方法通过创新参数化技术和稳定数据增强，显著提升了蒸馏效率和跨架构泛化能力。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新型的光场表示方法（ESI）和角度-时间交互网络（ATINet），在低光照场景下显著提升了目标跟踪性能，并在多目标跟踪任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

Conclusion: DAC框架通过结合CLIP和多模态大型语言模型（MLLM），显著提升了开放集3D物体检索的性能，平均mAP提高了10.01%，并在基于图像和跨数据集的设置中验证了其泛化能力。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频异常检测方法分为两类：基于DNN的方法侧重时间定位，基于LLM的方法侧重语义理解，但缺乏同时支持两者的模型和数据集。因此，需要整合两种任务并建立新的基准。

Method: 提出了GtS（Glance then Scrutinize）框架，这是一种基于文本提示的无训练方法，通过粗定位和细粒度解释两阶段实现异常检测。同时设计了JeAUG指标，联合评估语义解释和时间精度。

Result: VAGU基准测试集成了异常类别标注、语义解释、精确时间定位和视频问答，GtS框架和JeAUG指标在实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: VAGU（Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding）基准测试和GtS（Glance then Scrutinize）框架的提出，以及JeAUG评估指标的引入，显著提升了视频异常检测的综合性能，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Conclusion: 本文提出的Chain-of-Cooking模型在生成连贯且语义一致的烹饪过程图像方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

TL;DR: CS-DFD框架通过UVS和CGR模块协同缓解梯度冲突，提升深度伪造检测的域内准确性和跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度伪造检测中，联合训练原始数据和在线合成的伪造图像可能导致性能下降，这与常见观点相矛盾，即更多源域数据应提高检测准确性。研究发现这是由于反向传播中的梯度冲突导致的。

Method: 提出Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD)框架，包含两个模块：Update Vector Search (UVS)模块通过极值优化问题寻找唯一更新向量，以最大化每种数据类型的损失减少；Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR)模块通过Conflict Descent Loss惩罚梯度方向不一致，引导学习对齐且无冲突的表示。

Result: 实验表明，CS-DFD在多个深度伪造检测基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，包括域内检测准确性和跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: CS-DFD框架通过UVS和CGR模块协同作用，有效缓解了梯度冲突问题，在多个深度伪造检测基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，包括域内检测准确性和跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: 本文系统性地综述了太阳传感器建模和校准算法的现有研究，分析了研究空白，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的在线高精地图构建方法忽视了地图元素固有的空间和语义关系，限制了其准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一个端到端框架RelMap，包含Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior（通过可学习的类感知关系编码器显式编码地图元素间的相对位置依赖）和MoE-based Semantic Prior（基于预测的类别概率将特征路由到特定类别的专家，细化实例特征解码）。

Conclusion: RelMap通过引入Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior和MoE-based Semantic Prior，有效提升了在线高精地图构建的准确性和泛化能力，在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

Conclusion: LinDeps提出了一种基于线性依赖性分析的后剪枝方法，显著提升了CNN模型的压缩率同时保持性能，尤其在资源受限环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

TL;DR: TARS是一种token-adaptive preference策略，通过min-max优化减少MLLMs的幻觉，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DPO策略在处理幻觉相关偏好时存在过度拟合和分布刚性，导致视觉信息的基础不足。

Method: 提出了TARS，一种token-adaptive preference策略，将DPO重新表述为min-max优化问题，最大化token级分布偏移并最小化偏好损失。

Result: TARS在多个幻觉基准测试中表现优异，仅需4.8k偏好样本且无需专家反馈，将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4。

Conclusion: TARS通过提出一种token-adaptive preference策略，成功解决了MLLMs在视觉语言推理中的幻觉问题，显著降低了幻觉率，并在多个关键指标上表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部老化处理和潜在扩散精炼器，实现了面部老化过程的精细化控制，满足了身份保持、高保真图像和自然老化进程的关键标准。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的自监督跟踪框架SSTrack通过解耦的时空一致性训练框架和实例对比损失，成功减少了对手动标注框的依赖，并在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有的自监督跟踪方法。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Result: DeepLabv3在iPS细胞集落分割任务中表现优于大型基础模型，无需结构修改。

Conclusion: 在特定生物医学应用中，适当调整的简单模型可能比复杂的大型模型提供更强的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

TL;DR: EMIT通过难度感知GRPO优化MLLMs，提升工业异常检测性能，实验显示平均提升7.77%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉-语言推理方面表现强大，但在IAD中缺乏领域适应性，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出了EMIT框架，通过难度感知的组相对策略优化（GRPO）增强MLLMs，包括响应重采样策略和优势重加权机制。

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT相比基础模型（InternVL3-8B）在七项任务中平均提升7.77%。

Conclusion: EMIT显著提升了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在工业异常检测（IAD）中的性能，平均提高了7.77%。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的上下文感知修复方法缺乏对遮罩区域的精细控制，导致语义不一致或视觉不真实。

Method: 提出了GuidPaint框架，通过在去噪过程中引入分类器引导，结合随机和确定性采样，实现对中间生成内容的精确控制。

Conclusion: GuidPaint通过引入分类器引导，在无需额外训练的情况下，实现了对遮罩区域的精细控制，显著提升了语义一致性和视觉真实性，并在定量和定性评估中优于现有方法。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于补丁的方法在生成高分辨率图像时存在补丁级分布偏移和单调性问题，限制了生成图像的质量。

Method: 提出了自适应路径追踪（APT）框架，结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度技术，以解决补丁级分布偏移和增加的补丁单调性问题。

Conclusion: APT框架通过结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度，有效解决了基于补丁方法中的分布偏移和单调性问题，生成了更清晰、更精细的高分辨率图像，同时提高了推理速度。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

Motivation: 解决现有去标识化方法无法同时保留医学语义和灵活调整隐私级别的问题，同时处理医学基础模型中可能残留的身份信息。

Method: 分步框架包括身份阻断（调整隐私级别）和医学语义补偿（利用预训练的医学基础模型提取特征），并引入基于最小描述长度原则的特征解耦策略。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中，该方法表现优于现有方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的分步框架，通过身份阻断和医学语义补偿，结合特征解耦策略，有效解决了医学图像去标识化中的隐私保护与医学语义保留问题，并在多个数据集和下游任务中展示了卓越性能。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

Conclusion: 本研究通过系统性地消融分析，揭示了DETR、DDETR和DINO模型中关键组件对性能的影响，为优化模型透明度和效率提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

Conclusion: SAMITE模型通过引入原型记忆库和位置提示生成器，有效解决了目标遮挡和干扰问题，并在六个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at
https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.

Conclusion: MAGE框架通过创新的对齐机制和训练策略，显著提升了多模态模型的性能，并在多个评估基准上表现出色。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

Result: AdvRF在广泛使用的细粒度和粗粒度数据集上表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过对抗性重建反馈框架，成功学习到类别无关的差异表示，显著提升了细粒度图像检索的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

Motivation: 针对遥感等专业领域标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，提出一种无需标注监督的少样本强化学习框架（RLVR），以提升模型在卫星图像任务中的推理能力。

Method: 采用基于策略梯度的优化方法，结合轻量级规则（如二进制或IoU-based奖励），在最少一个示例的情况下对齐模型输出，适应卫星图像任务。

Result: 实验表明，仅需一个示例即可显著提升基础模型性能，128个示例的性能甚至超过基于数千标注样本训练的模型。尽管极端单样本设置可能导致轻微过拟合，但该方法在多样任务中表现出鲁棒的泛化能力和高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据稀缺领域提供了一种实用方案：从紧凑的视觉语言模型开始，通过少量可验证奖励的案例，利用RLVR进行训练，实现了领域专用模型的低成本高效开发。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems

TL;DR: MoR-ViT通过动态递归机制优化ViT，减少70%参数并加速2.5倍，同时保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准ViT架构存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出了MoR-ViT框架，首次引入令牌级动态递归机制，使每个令牌能自适应决定其处理深度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和迁移基准测试中，MoR-ViT实现了最先进的准确率，并显著优于DynamicViT和TinyViT等基线。

Conclusion: MoR-ViT通过动态递归机制显著提升了ViT的效率，实现了参数减少70%和推理加速2.5倍，同时保持了领先的准确率。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: AU-LLM首次将LLM应用于微表情AU检测，通过EFP融合视觉特征，在CASME II和SAMM数据集上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情动作单元（AUs）检测是情感计算中的关键挑战，而LLM在细粒度、低强度领域的应用尚未探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入AU-LLM框架，利用Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)通过MLP融合中层次（局部纹理）和高层次（全局语义）视觉特征，生成信息密集的token，以支持LLM进行精细推理。

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上，AU-LLM通过LOSO和跨域协议评估，实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM框架通过结合LLM和微表情检测，在CASME II和SAMM数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，验证了LLM在微表情分析中的潜力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGCoOp是一种多语义引导的上下文优化框架，通过并行上下文向量和LLM生成的类别描述提升少样本泛化能力，实验显示其在11个数据集上显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在新类别泛化上表现不佳，常因过拟合或遗忘通用知识。同时，提升泛化的方法往往伴随复杂架构或高计算开销。MSGCoOp旨在解决这些问题。

Conclusion: MSGCoOp通过引入多语义引导的上下文优化框架，显著提升了少样本泛化能力，同时保持了计算效率。该方法在11个基准数据集上表现出色，特别是在基础到新类别的泛化任务中，平均谐波均值提高了1.10%。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Conclusion: 该模型通过引入不确定性感知机制，显著提升了医学图像与文本预训练的性能，并在多个下游任务中实现了最先进的表现。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: HunyuanWorld 1.0 通过结合全景世界代理、网格导出能力和解耦对象表示，成功生成了沉浸式、可探索和交互式的3D场景，并在多个应用中展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,
physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Conclusion: 论文强调了迫切需要开发能够反映现实环境中这些越狱攻击易复制性的上下文感知防御机制。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有方法引入复杂模块、架构定制设计和过多参数，损害了效率和适用性，因此需要一种更简单、更通用的跨架构知识蒸馏方法。

Method: 提出了一种冗余抑制蒸馏（RSD）损失，包括跨架构不变性最大化和特征去相关目标，并设计了一个轻量级模块来解耦RSD目标与学生内部表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k基准测试上优于OFA方法，且参数开销仅为后者的一小部分。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种简单而有效的跨架构知识蒸馏方法，通过冗余信息抑制框架实现知识转移，证明了其在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k基准测试上的优越性，并展示了其作为跨架构蒸馏领域强基线的潜力。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD模型在利用光流和深度信息时，未能充分考虑它们在不同场景中的不等贡献，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出了选择性跨模态融合框架（SMFNet），包含像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM），以优化光流和深度信息的融合。

Result: 在RDVS和DVisal数据集上，SMFNet优于19种现有模型，并在合成深度视频数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性跨模态融合框架和像素级选择性融合策略，有效利用了光流和深度信息，显著提升了RGB-D视频显著性物体检测的性能，并在多个数据集上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

Conclusion: Vid-TTA 框架通过自我监督的辅助任务和动态损失平衡机制，显著提升了视频编辑的时间一致性和模型对多样化文本描述的鲁棒性，同时保持了低计算开销。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

Conclusion: 通过提出双模型框架和CLIP感知指向集成模块，以及辅助任务对象中心预测头，显著提高了在YouRefIt数据集上的表现，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，如风格分类F1提升8.4%，ArtPedia上的captioning BLEU@1提升7.1。定性分析显示其能解释视觉主题、推断历史背景。

Conclusion: ArtSeek不仅适用于视觉艺术，还可推广至其他需要外部知识的领域，支持可扩展的多模态AI研究。数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available
at https://github.com/cilabuniba/artseek.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SwinECAT模型，结合Swin和ECA注意力机制，用于9类眼底疾病分类，在公开数据集上达到最高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼底图像分析面临小病灶区域和疾病间差异细微的挑战，导致模型预测准确率下降和过拟合问题。

Method: 结合Swin Transformer的Shifted Window Attention和轻量级ECA Attention机制，提出SwinECAT模型，用于捕捉眼底图像的局部空间结构和长距离依赖关系。

Result: 在包含16,140张眼底图像的EDID数据集上，SwinECAT实现了88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏观F1分数0.90，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT模型在眼底疾病分类任务中表现出色，显著优于基线模型，达到了当前公开数据集上的最高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMAT-1M是首个百万规模多模态代理调优数据集，通过四阶段数据引擎构建，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补多模态领域缺乏大规模高质量代理调优数据集的空白，以释放多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建MMAT-1M数据集，包括数据筛选、GPT-4o生成理性、反思优化和单轮对话压缩。

Result: InternVL2.5-8B-RR模型在八个公共基准测试中平均提升2.7%，在Dyn-VQA基准测试中提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M数据集显著提升了多模态大语言模型在推理和工具使用方面的性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

TL;DR: LMAC-Net通过多模态注意力一致性机制，解决了长期动作质量评估中多模态协作和时间动态建模的难题，实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模多模态线索（如音乐）和跟踪长时间序列中的关键性能变化方面存在不足。

Method: 提出LMAC-Net，引入多模态注意力一致性机制，通过局部查询编码模块捕获时间语义和跨模态关系，并采用两级评分机制。

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上的实验表明，LMAC-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net通过多模态注意力一致性机制显著提升了长期动作质量评估的准确性，尤其在艺术体育项目中表现优异。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

Motivation: 现有的数据自由量化方法在生成合成图像时，由于单类别提示的多义性问题导致性能下降，且合成图像与量化模型泛化性之间的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出 mixup-class prompt，一种基于 mixup 的文本提示策略，通过在文本提示层面融合多个类别标签来生成多样且稳健的合成数据。

Result: 在卷积神经网络和视觉变换器上，mixup-class prompt 方法显著优于现有最先进的数据自由量化方法（如 GenQ），并在极低比特量化（如 W2A4）中实现了新的最先进精度。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt 策略通过融合多个类别标签生成多样且稳健的合成数据，显著提升了量化模型的泛化能力和优化稳定性，尤其在极低比特量化场景下实现了新的最先进精度。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

Motivation: 现有阴影去除方法依赖阴影掩码，但在实际场景中难以获取。探索内在图像线索（如局部对比信息）虽为替代方案，但在复杂场景中其固有模糊性成为关键限制。

Method: 提出了Adaptive Gated Dual-Branch Attention（AGBA）机制和diffusion-based Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network（FCFN），前者动态过滤和重新加权对比先验，后者利用高频和对比线索引导生成过程。

Conclusion: 本文提出的AGBA机制和FCFN网络在无需阴影掩码的情况下，通过动态过滤和重新加权对比先验，以及利用高频和对比线索引导生成过程，实现了与基于掩码方法相媲美的阴影去除效果。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个新颖的弱监督语义分割框架，通过结合CNN和ViT的师生框架，以及知识转移损失和后处理技术，有效解决了共现问题，提升了伪掩码质量。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R展示了在不依赖精确姿态信息的情况下，仍能显著超越现有方法的性能，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，早期检测至关重要。心电图（ECG）是识别心血管疾病的关键工具，但人工解读耗时且需专业知识。现有研究多关注数字信号自动解读，而实际临床中ECG数据多以图像形式存储，因此需开发针对图像分类的解决方案。

Method: 采用ConvNeXt架构作为模型主干，结合预处理管道减少视觉噪声，并采用两阶段微调策略：先在合成和外部ECG图像数据集上微调以学习领域特征，再在目标数据集上微调以增强疾病识别能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的深度学习框架在自动分类心电图图像方面表现出色，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法在生成符合攻击者意图的内容时面临挑战，且计算成本高，因此需要一种更高效且灵活的攻击方法。

Method: 提出了ZIUM，一种零次意图感知对抗攻击方法，允许灵活定制目标攻击图像以反映攻击者意图，并支持无需进一步优化的零次对抗攻击。

Result: 在各种机器未学习场景下的评估显示，ZIUM能成功根据用户意图提示定制内容，攻击成功率优于现有方法，且零次攻击显著减少了攻击时间。

Conclusion: ZIUM是一种有效且高效的方法，能够在无需额外优化的情况下，对未学习模型进行零次攻击，显著提高了攻击成功率并减少了攻击时间。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型所有者的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用或复制。

Method: 通过染色（水印）和锁定技术直接修改模型的少量权重，染色用于嵌入秘密行为以识别模型，锁定则使模型在未插入秘密触发器时无法使用。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种计算机视觉模型上均有效，且对模型性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的方法来保护和锁定计算机视觉模型，通过直接修改少量模型权重实现，对模型性能影响极小，且无需微调或重新训练。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature

discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

TL;DR: ViHallu通过视觉变异图像和视觉指令构建，有效减少LVLMs的幻觉现象，提升视觉-语义对齐能力，实验验证其有效性并发布相关数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）常出现幻觉现象，即生成的文本与视觉内容不一致，现有以文本为中心的幻觉缓解方法在细粒度视觉理解场景中效果有限。

Method: ViHallu框架通过生成可控视觉变异的图像（视觉变异图像）和构建视觉指令，增强模型对细粒度视觉内容的理解，从而优化视觉-语义对齐。

Result: ViHallu在多个基准测试中显著提升了模型的细粒度视觉理解能力，并减少了幻觉倾向。同时发布了专为幻觉缓解和视觉-语义对齐设计的ViHallu-Instruction数据集。

Conclusion: ViHallu通过视觉变异图像生成和视觉指令构建，显著提升了视觉-语义对齐能力，有效减少了大型视觉语言模型的幻觉现象，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

TL;DR: 密集音频-视觉模型在多语言低资源环境中表现优异，密集token路由是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证密集音频-视觉模型在低资源、多语言混杂和嘈杂环境中的表现，是否与英语高资源环境一致。

Method: 使用多语言Vaani项目子集，比较了三种对比目标：(i)全局平均池损失（CLIP风格），(ii)密集最大-平均token匹配（DenseAV风格），(iii)简单混合方法。

Result: 密集目标在音频-视觉检索中相对全局池化提升59% R@1，且能生成清晰的零样本定位热图。

Conclusion: 密集token路由不仅在英语高资源语料库中有效，在低资源、多语言混杂和嘈杂环境中同样表现出色，且更加关键。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Motivation: 随着AI在关键领域的广泛应用，理解其决策过程变得尤为重要。本文致力于为点云分类算法生成易于人类理解的解释，以辅助分析和决策。

Method: 提出了一种基于点云分割模型的XAI方法，利用新颖的点移位机制引入扰动，生成显著图。该方法通过分割模型确保生成的解释易于人类理解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的显著图比传统聚类方法更具可解释性，能有效展示分类模型的决策依据。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于分割的可解释人工智能（XAI）方法，用于点云分类的神经网络。通过新颖的点移位机制生成易于人类理解的显著图，相比传统聚类方法能产生更有意义的解释。

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

Method: 作者提出了 LCN-4，一个配备了位置感知特征聚类模块的网络，该模块能有效编码和整合空间特征融合、特征聚类和隐性特征定位，显著减少总体损失。此外，还提出了通用的网格位置编码补偿和频域位置嵌入技术。

Result: 在三个具有代表性的细粒度少样本基准测试中，LCN-4 显著优于基于 ConvNet-4 的最先进方法，并与大多数基于 ResNet12 的方法表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: LCN-4 在性能上显著优于基于 ConvNet-4 的最先进方法，并与大多数基于 ResNet12 的方法表现相当或更优，验证了作者的猜想。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

Conclusion: Ov3R框架通过结合CLIP语义信息直接参与3D重建过程，实现了全局一致的几何结构和细粒度语义对齐，在密集3D重建和开放词汇3D分割任务中达到了最先进的性能，推动了实时、语义感知的空间AI发展。

Abstract: We present Ov3R, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic 3D
reconstruction from RGB video streams, designed to advance Spatial AI. The
system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and
open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time,

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

Motivation: 解决自回归建模在图像生成中存在的视觉保真度低、输出扭曲及复杂指令遵循困难等问题。

Method: 框架包括语义图像标记器、统一的自回归模型（适用于语言和图像）以及用于图像生成的离线扩散解码器（X-Omni）。

Result: X-Omni在图像生成任务中达到最先进性能，使用7B语言模型生成高美学质量的图像，并展现出强大的指令遵循和长文本渲染能力。

Conclusion: X-Omni框架通过强化学习有效减少了自回归建模中的伪影，显著提升了生成质量，实现了图像与语言生成的无缝集成。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

TL;DR: StepAL 是一种专为手术步骤识别设计的主动学习框架，通过结合步骤感知特征和熵加权聚类，显著减少了标注需求并提高了识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法针对图像或短视频片段优化，但对于手术步骤识别来说，由于长未修剪手术视频中的步骤间依赖关系，这些方法不适用。

Method: StepAL 集成了一个步骤感知的特征表示，利用伪标签捕捉每个视频中预测步骤的分布，并结合熵加权聚类策略。

Result: 在两个白内障手术数据集（Cataract-1k 和 Cataract-101）上的实验表明，StepAL 始终优于现有的主动学习方法，用更少的标注视频实现了更高的步骤识别准确率。

Conclusion: StepAL 提供了一种有效的方法，用于高效的手术视频分析，减少了开发计算机辅助手术系统时的标注负担。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

Motivation: 现有FSVOS数据集和方法主要关注静态对象类别，忽视了视频中的丰富时间动态，限制了其在需要运动理解的场景中的应用。因此，研究团队旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究团队引入了MOVE数据集，专门针对运动引导的FSVOS设计，并评估了6种最新方法在2种实验设置下的表现。基于分析结果，提出了DMA方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前方法在运动引导的FSVOS任务上表现不佳，而提出的DMA方法在少镜头运动理解方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个名为DMA（Decoupled Motion Appearance Network）的基线方法，用于解决运动引导的少镜头视频对象分割（FSVOS）问题，并在实验中展示了其优越性能，为未来研究方向奠定了基础。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

Motivation: 解决CLIP在多语言数据训练中的两大挑战：缺乏非英语数据的处理方法和多语言训练导致的英语性能下降。

Method: 提出了MetaCLIP 2训练方法，通过最小必要改动处理多语言数据挑战，实现英语与非英语数据的互惠。

Result: 在零样本ImageNet分类中，MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14超越了其英语专用版本0.8%，并在多语言基准测试中创下新纪录。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2通过全球规模的数据训练，成功克服了多语言数据的诅咒，不仅在英语任务上超越了其英语专用版本，还在多语言基准测试中取得了新的最先进成果。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

Motivation: 现代AI应用处理高度结构化数据时，现有模糊测试工具和输入生成器通常针对特定输入类型手工制作，生成的无效输入导致效率低下和泛化能力差。

Method: 开发并评估了GRAphRef框架，该框架将结构化输入映射为图，应用邻居相似性引导的变异，并通过约束细化阶段修复无效输入。研究在八个真实世界的网格处理AI系统中进行了验证性研究。

Result: GRAphRef在结构有效性、语义保存和性能开销方面优于AFL、MeshAttack、Saffron及两个消融变体。

Conclusion: GRAphRef框架通过基于图的表示和约束驱动的变异策略，显著提高了测试输入的结构有效性和语义保存能力，证明了其在结构化数据领域的通用性和高效性。

Abstract: [Context] Modern AI applications increasingly process highly structured data,
such as 3D meshes and point clouds, where test input generation must preserve
both structural and semantic validity. However, existing fuzzing tools and
input generators are typically handcrafted for specific input types and often
generate invalid inputs that are subsequently discarded, leading to
inefficiency and poor generalizability. [Objective] This study investigates
whether test inputs for structured domains can be unified through a graph-based
representation, enabling general, reusable mutation strategies while enforcing
structural constraints. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in
enhancing input validity and semantic preservation across eight AI systems.
[Method] We develop and evaluate GRAphRef, a graph-based test input generation
framework that supports constraint-based mutation and refinement. GRAphRef maps
structured inputs to graphs, applies neighbor-similarity-guided mutations, and
uses a constraint-refinement phase to repair invalid inputs. We will conduct a
confirmatory study across eight real-world mesh-processing AI systems,
comparing GRAphRef with AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and two ablated variants.
Evaluation metrics include structural validity, semantic preservation (via
prediction consistency), and performance overhead. Experimental data is derived
from ShapeNetCore mesh seeds and model outputs from systems like MeshCNN and
HodgeNet. Statistical analysis and component latency breakdowns will be used to
assess each hypothesis.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI工具在软件工程中开发者采用率不均的问题，及其对生产力、管理期望和开发者未来角色的影响。

Method: 通过对27个团队的54名开发者进行配对访谈（每团队一名频繁使用者和一名不频繁使用者），分析了使用差异的主要原因。

Result: 使用差异主要源于开发者对工具的认知（合作者 vs. 功能）、参与方式（实验性 vs. 保守）以及遇到挑战时的应对策略（适应坚持 vs. 快速放弃）。

Conclusion: 研究发现，广泛的组织期望在没有足够学习支持的情况下快速获得生产力提升，导致了‘生产力压力悖论’，反而削弱了推动采用的生产力效益。

Abstract: Despite the widespread availability of generative AI tools in software
engineering, developer adoption remains uneven. This unevenness is problematic
because it hampers productivity efforts, frustrates management's expectations,
and creates uncertainty around the future roles of developers. Through paired
interviews with 54 developers across 27 teams -- one frequent and one
infrequent user per team -- we demonstrate that differences in usage result
primarily from how developers perceive the tool (as a collaborator vs.
feature), their engagement approach (experimental vs. conservative), and how
they respond when encountering challenges (with adaptive persistence vs. quick
abandonment). Our findings imply that widespread organizational expectations
for rapid productivity gains without sufficient investment in learning support
creates a "Productivity Pressure Paradox," undermining the very productivity
benefits that motivate adoption.

Motivation: 并发系统中的bug往往在罕见条件下才显现，难以复现，需要一种系统化的方法来放大这些难以捉摸的bug的出现率。

Method: 将系统视为黑盒，通过重复试验执行训练预测模型，估计特定输入配置触发bug的概率，并比较了多种基于模型的搜索技术与随机抽样基线。

Result: 在17个代表性并发bug的数据集上，回归模型集成方法显著提高了bug的出现率，通常比随机抽样高出一个数量级。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于模型引导搜索的方法，显著提高了并发系统中难以复现的bug的出现率，且无需修改系统内部架构。

Abstract: Bugs, especially those in concurrent systems, are often hard to reproduce
because they manifest only under rare conditions. Testers frequently encounter
failures that occur only under specific inputs, even when occurring with low
probability. We propose an approach to systematically amplify the occurrence of
such elusive bugs. We treat the system under test as a black-box and use
repeated trial executions to train a predictive model that estimates the
probability of a given input configuration triggering a bug. We evaluate this
approach on a dataset of 17 representative concurrency bugs spanning diverse
categories. Several model-based search techniques are compared against a
brute-force random sampling baseline. Our results show that an ensemble of
regression models can significantly increase bug occurrence rates across nearly
all scenarios, often achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement over random
sampling. The contributions of this work include: (i) a novel formulation of
bug-amplification as a rare-event regression problem; (ii) an empirical
evaluation of multiple techniques for amplifying bug occurrence, demonstrating
the effectiveness of model-guided search; and (iii) a practical, non-invasive
testing framework that helps practitioners expose hidden concurrency faults
without altering the internal system architecture.

Method: 分析了94,994个至少有一个被接受编辑的Python相关答案，评估编辑对六个关键质量维度的影响。

Result: 编辑既有积极也有消极影响：53.3%的编辑提升了语义相关性，但38.1%降低了相关性；9%的代码从不可执行变为可执行，但14.7%的代码变为不可解析；32.3%的编辑增加了代码复杂性；20.5%的编辑引入了安全问题；51.0%的编辑优化了性能，但执行时间总体增加；49.7%的编辑降低了可读性。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了协作编辑在技术问答平台中的不一致效果，强调了编辑对软件可维护性、安全性和效率的复杂影响，为未来改进协作编辑系统提供了见解。

Abstract: High-quality answers in technical Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow (SO) are
crucial as they directly influence software development practices. Poor-quality
answers can introduce inefficiencies, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, and
thus increase maintenance costs and technical debt in production software. To
improve content quality, SO allows collaborative editing, where users revise
answers to enhance clarity, correctness, and formatting. Several studies have
examined rejected edits and identified the causes of rejection. However, prior
research has not systematically assessed whether accepted edits enhance key
quality dimensions. While one study investigated the impact of edits on C/C++
vulnerabilities, broader quality aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we
analyze 94,994 Python-related answers that have at least one accepted edit to
determine whether edits improve (1) semantic relevance, (2) code usability, (3)
code complexity, (4) security vulnerabilities, (5) code optimization, and (6)
readability. Our findings show both positive and negative effects of edits.
While 53.3% of edits improve how well answers match questions, 38.1% make them
less relevant. Some previously broken code (9%) becomes executable, yet working
code (14.7%) turns non-parsable after edits. Many edits increase complexity
(32.3%), making code harder to maintain. Instead of fixing security issues,
20.5% of edits introduce additional issues. Even though 51.0% of edits optimize
performance, execution time still increases overall. Readability also suffers,
as 49.7% of edits make code harder to read. This study highlights the
inconsistencies in editing outcomes and provides insights into how edits impact
software maintainability, security, and efficiency that might caution users and
moderators and help future improvements in collaborative editing systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MAAD框架通过多代理系统自动化软件架构设计，生成全面架构和评估报告，优于现有基线，且GPT-4o表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件架构设计过程耗时、依赖人工且设计选项有限，尤其是在敏捷开发压力下。LLM代理在其他SE任务中表现优异，但在架构设计中的应用仍不足。

Method: 提出MAAD框架，利用知识驱动的多代理系统（MAS）进行架构设计，包含四个专业代理（分析师、建模师、设计师和评估师）协作完成需求解析和架构蓝图生成。

Result: MAAD在案例研究和对比实验中优于MetaGPT，生成更全面的架构组件和结构化评估报告。工业架构师的反馈进一步验证了其实用性。GPT-4o在三种LLM中表现最佳。

Conclusion: MAAD框架通过多代理系统在软件架构设计领域展现出显著优势，特别是在生成全面架构组件和结构化评估报告方面。同时，GPT-4o在架构设计中的表现优于其他LLM，凸显了LLM选择的重要性。

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A dual-LLM system is proposed to generate and verify compiler tests, showing LLMs' potential despite challenges like hallucinations and trust issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing but realistic expectations of LLMs in software and test development highlight the need for verifying their correctness and addressing issues like hallucinations and lack of explainability.

Method: The paper proposes a dual-LLM system (generative and discriminative LLMs) and experiments with various LLMs of differing parameter counts to generate a large volume of compiler tests, evaluated using ten detailed metrics.

Result: Experimental results show that LLMs can effectively generate and verify compiler tests, with performance varying based on the model's parameter count.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate promising potential for generating and automatically verifying quality compiler tests, as evidenced by the experimental results with a dual-LLM system.

Abstract: The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development
has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently
have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness
of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have
been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet.
Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems
without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to
explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their
results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply
LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a
discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation
of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs
possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten
carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through
our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to
generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.

TL;DR: HLSDebugger通过生成大规模标注数据集和编码器-解码器模型，显著提升HLS代码的自动化调试性能，尤其在错误修正上远超GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HLS代码调试对新手和缺乏硬件知识的软件工程师来说极具挑战性，而现有LLM在应用时面临高质量电路数据稀缺、硬件逻辑错误调试复杂以及缺乏可靠测试用例等问题。

Method: HLSDebugger采用编码器-解码器结构，通过同一模型执行错误定位、错误类型预测和错误修正。

Result: HLSDebugger在错误识别和修正上表现优异，修正能力超过GPT-4三倍以上。

Conclusion: HLSDebugger显著提升了HLS代码的自动化调试能力，尤其是在错误定位和修正方面超越了GPT-4等先进LLM模型。

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件开发面临伦理挑战，影响项目可持续性。当前的行为准则监测方法存在局限性。

Method: 通过定义基于贡献者公约的伦理指标，并利用提示工程指导LLM输出，开发了一种分类方法。

Result: 提出了一种有效的伦理行为分类方法，可用于评估OSS非编码贡献的伦理质量。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的方法来评估开源软件（OSS）项目中非编码贡献的伦理质量，填补了当前伦理行为监测方法的不足。

Abstract: The development of Open-Source Software (OSS) is not only a technical
challenge, but also a social one due to the diverse mixture of contributors. To
this aim, social-coding platforms, such as GitHub, provide the infrastructure
needed to host and develop the code, but also the support for enabling the
community's collaboration, which is driven by non-coding contributions, such as
issues (i.e., change proposals or bug reports) or comments to existing
contributions. As with any other social endeavor, this development process
faces ethical challenges, which may put at risk the project's sustainability.
To foster a productive and positive environment, OSS projects are increasingly
deploying codes of conduct, which define rules to ensure a respectful and
inclusive participatory environment, with the Contributor Covenant being the
main model to follow. However, monitoring and enforcing these codes of conduct
is a challenging task, due to the limitations of current approaches. In this
paper, we propose an approach to classify the ethical quality of non-coding
contributions in OSS projects by relying on Large Language Models (LLM), a
promising technology for text classification tasks. We defined a set of ethical
metrics based on the Contributor Covenant and developed a classification
approach to assess ethical behavior in OSS non-coding contributions, using
prompt engineering to guide the model's output.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于多视角特征的开源软件维护风险预测方法，通过大规模数据集和AFT生存分析验证了其优越性，并在实际生态系统中进行了应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件维护风险对现代软件供应链的质量、安全和韧性构成重大威胁，现有方法存在操作定义模糊、可解释性有限及数据集规模不足等问题。

Method: 研究引入了基于明确存档状态和项目文档语义分析的'维护停止'概念，构建了一个包含115,466个GitHub仓库的大规模纵向数据集，并提出了一个集成的多视角特征框架。

Result: AFT生存分析显示C指数高达0.846，显著优于仅依赖表面特征的模型，特征消融和SHAP分析进一步验证了方法的有效性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究为开源软件维护风险的预测提供了一个可扩展且可解释的基础，支持大规模开源生态系统中的可重复风险管理。

Abstract: The maintenance risks of open source software (OSS) projects pose significant
threats to the quality, security, and resilience of modern software supply
chains. While prior research has proposed diverse approaches for predicting OSS
maintenance risk -- leveraging signals ranging from surface features (e.g.,
stars, commits) to social network analyses and behavioral patterns -- existing
methods often suffer from ambiguous operational definitions, limited
interpretability, and datasets of insufficient scale or generalizability. In
this work, we introduce ``maintenance cessation'', grounded in both explicit
archival status and rigorous semantic analysis of project documentation.
Building on this foundation, we curate a large-scale, longitudinal dataset of
115,466 GitHub repositories -- encompassing 57,733 confirmed cessation events
-- complemented by comprehensive, timeline-based behavioral features. We
propose an integrated, multi-perspective feature framework for predicting
maintenance cessation, systematically combining user-centric features,
maintainer-centric features and project evolution features. AFT survival
analysis demonstrates a high C-index (0.846), substantially outperforming
models relying only on surface features. Feature ablation and SHAP analysis
further confirm the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach.
Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by deploying a GBSA classifier
in the openEuler ecosystem for proactive package risk screening. Our work
establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for maintenance-risk
prediction, enabling reproducible risk management across large-scale open
source ecosystems.

Motivation: 随着LLM在代码生成中的广泛应用，维护学术诚信和招聘公平性需要强大的AI生成代码检测系统。

Method: 从CodeNet数据集中生成多种编程语言的AI生成代码样本，使用六种不同LLM和三种提示，涵盖三种关键使用场景。

Result: 创建了包含121,271个AI生成和32,148个人工编写代码片段的MultiAIGCD数据集，并评估了三种最先进的检测模型在不同测试场景中的性能。

Conclusion: MultiAIGCD数据集和基准测试为AI生成代码检测提供了重要资源，支持学术诚信和招聘公平性的研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three
state-of-the-art AI-generated code detection models and assess their
performance in various test scenarios such as cross-model and cross-language.
We share our dataset and codes to support research in this field.

Motivation: 随着AI生成代码的普及，软件开发正在经历根本性转变，但快速采用与有限的概念理解之间存在脱节，这促使了对这一新兴范式的探究。

Method: 通过意图视角和历史分析，定义了vibe编码作为一种软件开发范式，其中人类与生成式AI通过自然语言对话共同创造软件工件。

Result: 研究表明，vibe编码通过重新分配人类与机器之间的认知劳动，改变了软件开发过程中的专业知识分布，从传统领域（如设计或技术实现）转向协作编排。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个研究议程，涵盖以人为中心、技术为中心和组织为中心的方向，以指导未来对这一新兴范式的研究。

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

TL;DR: DeepGo是一个预测性灰盒模糊测试工具，通过路径转换模型和强化学习优化路径选择，显著提升DGF效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DGF技术主要依赖启发式算法，缺乏对未执行路径的预见性，导致难以处理复杂约束路径。

Method: 提出了路径转换模型和虚拟集成环境（VEE），并结合强化学习（RLF）模型生成最优路径转换序列。

Result: DeepGo能够更高效地到达目标站点，解决了传统DGF在复杂路径上的效率问题。

Conclusion: DeepGo通过结合历史和预测信息，优化了DGF的路径选择，显著提高了到达目标站点的效率和精确度。

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

TL;DR: 研究探索预训练代码语言模型检测跨语言错误的潜力，发现微调后性能显著提升，小型模型表现更优，且跨语言错误与单语言错误不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言编程在项目中日益普遍，但跨语言错误（CLBs）难以通过单语言错误检测工具发现，因此探索预训练代码语言模型在CLB检测中的潜力。

Method: 开发了CLCFinder工具，构建了一个包含三种编程语言组合和九种交互类型的跨语言错误数据集，并对13种CodeLMs进行了微调和性能评估。

Result: 微调后的CodeLMs性能显著提升，UniXcoder-base的F1得分最高（0.7407）。小型微调模型表现优于大型模型，且增加微调数据集规模显著提升性能，但更长的令牌序列不一定改善模型表现。

Conclusion: 预训练的代码语言模型（CodeLMs）在跨语言错误检测中表现出潜力，尤其是经过微调后性能显著提升，其中UniXcoder-base表现最佳。此外，小型微调模型表现优于大型模型，且跨语言错误与单语言错误存在明显差异。

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SpGEMM因不规则内存访问模式导致数据移动成为瓶颈，现有研究多集中于SpMV，缺乏对SpGEMM的优化。

Method: 提出了一种分层聚类方法，结合行重排序和簇级计算，设计了新的行聚类矩阵格式和访问模式。

Result: 分层聚类平均加速SpGEMM 1.39倍，预处理成本低于单次SpGEMM的20倍。

Conclusion: 分层聚类方法通过结合行重排序和簇级计算，显著提升了SpGEMM的性能，平均加速1.39倍，且预处理成本较低。

Abstract: Sparse matrix-sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a key kernel in many
scientific applications and graph workloads. Unfortunately, SpGEMM is
bottlenecked by data movement due to its irregular memory access patterns.
Significant work has been devoted to developing row reordering schemes towards
improving locality in sparse operations, but prior studies mostly focus on the
case of sparse-matrix vector multiplication (SpMV).
  In this paper, we address these issues with hierarchical clustering for
SpGEMM that leverages both row reordering and cluster-wise computation to
improve reuse in the second input (B) matrix with a novel row-clustered matrix
format and access pattern in the first input (A) matrix. We find that
hierarchical clustering can speed up SpGEMM by 1.39x on average with low
preprocessing cost (less than 20x the cost of a single SpGEMM on about 90% of
inputs). Furthermore, we decouple the reordering algorithm from the clustered
matrix format so they can be applied as independent optimizations.
  Additionally, this paper sheds light on the role of both row reordering and
clustering independently and together for SpGEMM with a comprehensive empirical
study of the effect of 10 different reordering algorithms and 3 clustering
schemes on SpGEMM performance on a suite of 110 matrices. We find that
reordering based on graph partitioning provides better SpGEMM performance than
existing alternatives at the cost of high preprocessing time. The evaluation
demonstrates that the proposed hierarchical clustering method achieves greater
average speedup compared to other reordering schemes with similar preprocessing
times.

Motivation: 为简化GlideinWMS的开发、测试及新成员培训流程，设计了一种类似系统的容器化工作区。

Method: 构建了基于三个核心容器的系统：单节点集群、GlideinWMS工厂和调度器前端，支持可选组件扩展，并评估了不同容器运行时的易用性和性能。

Result: 工作区成功集成到开发环境中，支持离线开发与测试，显著提升了学生和开发者的实践体验。

Conclusion: GlideinWMS工作区通过简化开发、测试和培训流程，显著提升了开发效率和团队成员的入职体验。

Abstract: GlideinWMS is a workload manager provisioning resources for many experiments,
including CMS and DUNE. The software is distributed both as native packages and
specialized production containers. Following an approach used in other
communities like web development, we built our workspaces, system-like
containers to ease development and testing. Developers can change the source
tree or check out a different branch and quickly reconfigure the services to
see the effect of their changes. In this paper, we will talk about what
differentiates workspaces from other containers. We will describe our base
system, composed of three containers: a one-node cluster including a compute
element and a batch system, a GlideinWMS Factory controlling pilot jobs, and a
scheduler and Frontend to submit jobs and provision resources. Additional
containers can be used for optional components. This system can easily run on a
laptop, and we will share our evaluation of different container runtimes, with
an eye for ease of use and performance. Finally, we will talk about our
experience as developers and with students. The GlideinWMS workspaces are
easily integrated with IDEs like VS Code, simplifying debugging and allowing
development and testing of the system even when offline. They simplified the
training and onboarding of new team members and summer interns. And they were
useful in workshops where students could have first-hand experience with the
mechanisms and components that, in production, run millions of jobs.

Motivation: 传统资源基准测试过程繁琐且耗时，亟需一种自动化工具来优化资源选择，以提升作业完成速度、硬件利用率和降低成本。

Method: 开发了GlideinBenchmark这一新型Web应用，结合GlideinWMS Factory控制基准测试的执行，并通过HEPCloud的Decision Engine等调度器优化资源分配。

Result: GlideinBenchmark能够自动执行基准测试，并通过收集的数据支持资源的优化选择，实验证明其能有效评估工作流性能。

Conclusion: GlideinBenchmark通过利用GlideinWMS的pilot基础设施，成功实现了资源的自动化基准测试和优化选择，显著提升了资源利用效率并降低了成本。

Abstract: Choosing the right resource can speed up job completion, better utilize the
available hardware, and visibly reduce costs, especially when renting computers
in the cloud. This was demonstrated in earlier studies on HEPCloud. However,
the benchmarking of the resources proved to be a laborious and time-consuming
process. This paper presents GlideinBenchmark, a new Web application leveraging
the pilot infrastructure of GlideinWMS to benchmark resources, and it shows how
to use the data collected and published by GlideinBenchmark to automate the
optimal selection of resources. An experiment can select the benchmark or the
set of benchmarks that most closely evaluate the performance of its workflows.
GlideinBenchmark, with the help of the GlideinWMS Factory, controls the
benchmark execution. Finally, a scheduler like HEPCloud's Decision Engine can
use the results to optimize resource provisioning.

Conclusion: B-skiplist在保持传统skiplist简单性的同时，显著提升了缓存局部性和性能，在多线程环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Skiplists are widely used for in-memory indexing in many key-value stores,
such as RocksDB and LevelDB, due to their ease of implementation and simple
concurrency control mechanisms. However, traditional skiplists suffer from poor
cache locality, as they store only a single element per node, leaving
performance on the table. Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to
maximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential.
In this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache
locality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional
skiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions
include a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a
corresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128
threads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher
throughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations,
including Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java
ConcurrentSkipListMap. Furthermore, we find that the B-skiplist achieves
competitive (0.9x-1.7x) throughput on point workloads compared to
state-of-the-art cache-optimized tree-based indices (e.g., Masstree). For a
more complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of
skiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between
3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between
0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads
with inserts.

TL;DR: CSM编程模型通过协作状态机机制，显著提升了Cloud-Edge-IoT应用的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编程模型难以有效管理Cloud-Edge-IoT应用的动态和状态特性，需要一种新的模型来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出了协作状态机（CSM）编程模型，包括状态机协作机制、状态封装、动作和服务调用集成以及高级数据模型，并开发了运行时系统。

Result: 在压力测试中吞吐量提升12倍，监控系统用例中每张图像处理时间减少2.3倍，智能工厂用例总处理时间减少55倍。

Conclusion: CSM编程模型通过其协作状态机机制，有效解决了Cloud-Edge-IoT应用中动态和状态管理的复杂性，显著提升了处理性能和生产力。

Abstract: The development of Cloud-Edge-IoT applications requires robust programming
models. Existing models often struggle to manage the dynamic and stateful
nature of these applications effectively. This paper introduces the
Collaborative State Machines (CSM) programming model to address these
complexities. CSM facilitates the development of reactive, event-driven, and
stateful applications targeting the Cloud-Edge-IoT continuum. Applications
built with CSM are composed of state machines that collaborate autonomously and
can be distributed across different layers of the continuum. Key features of
CSM include (i) a sophisticated collaboration mechanism among state machines
utilizing events and persistent data; (ii) encapsulation of state through the
inherent state of state machines and persistent data; (iii) integration of
actions and service invocations within states and state transitions, thereby
decoupling complex application logic from compute and data processing services;
and (iv) an advanced data model that supports the processing of local, static,
and persistent data with defined scope and lifetime. In addition to introducing
the CSM programming model, we present a runtime system and a comprehensive
evaluation of our approach. This evaluation is based on three use cases: a
stress test on a large-scale infrastructure, a surveillance system application,
and a complex smart factory scenario, all deployed on the Grid'5000 testbed.
Our results demonstrate a 12x increase in throughput through novel language
features in the stress test. Compared to Serverless Workflow, a
state-of-the-art baseline system, we show a 2.3x improvement in processing time
per processed image in a surveillance system use case, a 55x reduction in total
processing time for a smart factory use case, and an overall improvement in
productivity across these use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少大规模分布式内存问题中的通信成本，特别是全局同步成本，是提高性能的关键。

Method: 评估BCGSI+P-1S和BCGSI+P-2S在分布式内存系统上的性能，并与其它低同步BCGS变体进行比较。

Result: BCGSI+P-1S和BCGSI+P-2S分别实现了高达4倍和2倍的速度提升，且稳定性优于其他同同步成本的变体。

Conclusion: BCGSI+P-1S和BCGSI+P-2S因其在分布式内存系统中计算经济QR分解时的优越稳定性，被推荐为最佳实践选择。

Abstract: Numerous applications, such as Krylov subspace solvers, make extensive use of
the block classical Gram-Schmidt (BCGS) algorithm and its reorthogonalized
variants for orthogonalizing a set of vectors. For large-scale problems in
distributed memory settings, the communication cost, particularly the global
synchronization cost, is a major performance bottleneck. In recent years, many
low-synchronization BCGS variants have been proposed in an effort to reduce the
number of synchronization points. The work [E. Carson, Y. Ma, arXiv preprint
2411.07077] recently proposed stable one-synchronization and
two-synchronization variants of BCGS, i.e., BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S. In this
work, we evaluate the performance of BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S on a distributed
memory system compared to other well-known low-synchronization BCGS variants.
In comparison to the classical reorthogonalized BCGS algorithm (BCGSI+),
numerical experiments demonstrate that BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S can achieve up
to 4 times and 2 times speedups, respectively, and perform similarly to other
(less stable) one-synchronization and two-synchronization variants. BCGSI+P-1S
and BCGSI+P-2S are therefore recommended as the best choice in practice for
computing an economic QR factorization on distributed memory systems due to
their superior stability when compared to other variants with the same
synchronization cost.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于DRL的AI代理，用于优化5G小区DTX/DRX配置，在节能和QoS之间实现平衡，模拟结果显示节能效果显著且QoS影响极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中的小区DTX/DRX技术通过周期性聚合用户数据传输以实现节能，但会增加数据包延迟。如何在节能和QoS之间实现最优平衡是一个复杂问题，需要针对不同网络和流量条件进行动态配置。

Method: 论文采用深度Q网络（DQN）与上下文赌博机（CB）模型相结合的深度强化学习框架，设计了一种平滑逼近理论最优但不连续奖励函数的算法，以训练AI代理在不同网络和流量条件下选择最佳的小区DTX/DRX配置。

Result: 模拟结果显示，相比未使用小区DTX/DRX的情况，该方法在不同流量负载场景下可实现高达45%的节能效果，同时QoS退化始终控制在约1%以内。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的AI代理，用于优化5G网络中的小区DTX/DRX配置，以在节能和服务质量（QoS）之间实现最佳平衡。通过模拟验证，该方法在保持QoS退化不超过1%的同时，可实现高达45%的节能效果。

Abstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX)
is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain
technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given
duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time
can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down
more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably
the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is
allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally
balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic
maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of
service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for
different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort
to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve
it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a
deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward
function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but
discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always
tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network
and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when
cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving
depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than
~1% QoS degradation.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于SS-NN和TL的EDFA增益谱预测方法，通过两阶段训练和协方差匹配提升精度，实验证明其高效且适应多厂商环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络向多厂商解决方案发展，精确建模EDFA增益谱对优化光网络性能至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：无监督预训练（噪声增强测量）和监督微调（自定义加权MSE损失）。通过迁移学习技术支持同质和异质模型适应，并引入协方差匹配损失解决异质TL中的特征不匹配问题。

Result: 在COSMOS和Open Ireland测试床的26个EDFA上验证，该方法显著减少测量需求，平均绝对误差更低，误差分布优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于半监督自归一化神经网络（SS-NN）和迁移学习（TL）的架构显著提高了EDFA增益谱预测的准确性，减少了测量需求，并在多厂商网络环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the gain spectrum in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers
(EDFAs) is essential for optimizing optical network performance, particularly
as networks evolve toward multi-vendor solutions. In this work, we propose a
generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture based on a Semi-Supervised
Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) that leverages internal EDFA features -
such as VOA input or output power and attenuation, to improve gain spectrum
prediction. Our SS-NN model employs a two-phase training strategy comprising
unsupervised pre-training with noise-augmented measurements and supervised
fine-tuning with a custom weighted MSE loss. Furthermore, we extend the
framework with transfer learning (TL) techniques that enable both homogeneous
(same-feature space) and heterogeneous (different-feature sets) model
adaptation across booster, preamplifier, and ILA EDFAs. To address feature
mismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to
align second-order feature statistics between source and target domains.
Extensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland
testbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
number of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean
absolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.

TL;DR: RRTO 是一种透明卸载系统，通过记录/重放机制减少 RPC 调用，显著降低延迟和能耗，无需代码修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的移动设备上部署 ML 应用面临挑战，现有透明卸载方法因频繁的 RPC 导致高延迟，而非透明方法需要侵入式代码修改。

Method: RRTO 引入了记录/重放机制，利用 ML 模型中的静态操作符序列消除重复的 RPC。通过集成新颖的操作符序列搜索算法，可靠地识别这一序列。

Result: 评估显示，RRTO 在每次推理延迟和能耗上比现有透明方法减少高达 98%，性能与非透明方法相当。

Conclusion: RRTO 是一种高性能透明卸载系统，专为 MEC 推理设计，无需修改源代码即可实现与非透明方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Deploying Machine Learning (ML) applications on resource-constrained mobile
devices remains challenging due to limited computational resources and poor
platform compatibility. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers
offloading-based inference paradigm using GPU servers, existing approaches are
divided into non-transparent and transparent methods, with the latter
necessitating modifications to the source code. Non-transparent offloading
achieves high performance but requires intrusive code modification, limiting
compatibility with diverse applications. Transparent offloading, in contrast,
offers wide compatibility but introduces significant transmission delays due to
per-operator remote procedure calls (RPCs). To overcome this limitation, we
propose RRTO, the first high-performance transparent offloading system tailored
for MEC inference. RRTO introduces a record/replay mechanism that leverages the
static operator sequence in ML models to eliminate repetitive RPCs. To reliably
identify this sequence, RRTO integrates a novel Operator Sequence Search
algorithm that detects repeated patterns, filters initialization noise, and
accelerates matching via a two-level strategy. Evaluation demonstrates that
RRTO achieves substantial reductions of up to 98% in both per-inference latency
and energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art transparent methods and
yields results comparable to non-transparent approaches, all without
necessitating any source code modification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明推理过程阻碍了人类监督与协作潜力，现有可解释AI方法难以建立真正的共生协作。

Method: 引入了SynLang（共生语法语言）作为透明人机协作的正式协议，包括TRACE和TRACE_FE两种机制，并结合信心量化和上下文继承。

Result: 通过实际人机对话验证了框架的有效性，展示了AI对结构化推理协议的适应及成功的元认知干预。

Conclusion: 通过双级透明度和结构化沟通，SynLang与共生认识论共同实现了增强人类智能、保持人类能动性并在协作决策中维护伦理责任的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

Method: 论文展示了LLMs支持Synthea模块创建的四种方式：生成疾病概况、从疾病概况生成疾病模块、评估现有Synthea模块以及优化现有模块。引入了渐进式优化的概念。

Result: LLMs在Synthea模块创建中显示出潜力，但也面临挑战，如需要人工监督、严格的测试和验证以及LLM生成内容可能存在的准确性问题。

Conclusion: 论文总结了LLMs在Synthea模块开发中的潜力，并提出了未来研究和发展的建议，以充分发挥LLM辅助合成数据创建的优势。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

Motivation: 当前LLM部署中推理服务与持续再训练分离导致资源利用效率低下和适应新数据延迟的问题。

Method: LeMix整合了离线分析、执行预测机制和运行时调度，根据工作负载特征和系统条件动态调整资源分配。

Result: LeMix相比传统分离式部署，吞吐量提升最高3.53倍，推理损失降低最高0.61倍，响应时间SLO达成率提升最高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix通过联合管理LLM推理与训练工作负载，显著提升了资源利用率和服务响应质量，为生产环境中LLM的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

Method: NPO引入了一种可测量、可监督且在结构化反馈下可减少的对齐损失形式化方法，并提出了元对齐作为监控过程的保真度。实现包括场景评分、阈值调整、策略验证和结构化反馈摄入。

Result: 在随机反馈下，NPO展示了对齐损失和监控保真度的加性收敛，并在超大规模部署中显示出可测量的价值。

Conclusion: NPO提供了一个紧凑、可检查的架构，用于持续对齐监控，帮助在动态环境中将理论对齐保证与实际可靠性联系起来。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

### [123] [Can You Trust an LLM with Your Life-Changing Decision? An Investigation into AI High-Stakes Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21132)
*Joshua Adrian Cahyono,Saran Subramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在提供高风险建议时存在谄媚和过度自信问题，但通过实验证明询问澄清问题和激活引导可提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地被用于高风险生活建议，但缺乏标准保障措施以防止自信但误导性的回答，存在谄媚和过度自信的风险。

Method: 通过三个实验进行研究：(1)多项选择评估模型对用户压力的稳定性；(2)使用新型安全分类法和LLM法官进行自由回答分析；(3)通过操纵“高风险”激活向量进行机制解释性实验。

Result: 结果显示，某些模型表现出谄媚行为，而其他模型（如o4-mini）保持稳健。表现最佳的模型通过频繁询问澄清问题实现高安全分数，而非提供处方性建议。此外，通过激活引导可直接控制模型的谨慎性，为安全对齐提供了新途径。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要多方面的基准测试来确保大型语言模型在影响生活的决策中值得信赖。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

*Arman Eisenkolb-Vaithyanathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种新的Sudoku难度指标，并构建了一个通用评级系统，能够跨网站一致分类Sudoku谜题的难度，实验结果显示其与四个网站的标注难度高度吻合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在回答“不同Sudoku网站上的Sudoku难度评级是如何构成的？”这一问题，并试图建立一个跨网站的一致性难度评级系统。

Method: 论文采用两种方法：1) 将Sudoku谜题转化为对应的可满足性（SAT）问题，并从中提取SAT子句长度分布作为第一个难度指标；2) 模拟人类解谜者，通过在一个称为Nishio的回溯算法中交织四种流行的Sudoku策略，并计算策略应用的次数作为第二个难度指标。使用这两个指标，作者分析了五个流行网站上的1000多个Sudoku谜题。

Result: 通过Spearman等级相关系数评估，作者发现提出的指标与四个网站标注的难度级别存在强相关性。基于这两个指标，作者构建了一个简单的无监督分类器，能够将谜题分类为三个通用难度级别。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个通用的Sudoku难度评级系统，能够将不同网站上的Sudoku谜题和难度级别分类为三个类别：Universal Easy、Universal Medium和Universal Hard，从而实现了跨网站的一致性难度映射。实验结果表明，对于五个Sudoku网站中的四个，该通用分类与网站标注的难度级别吻合良好。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并可靠地控制大型语言模型的有害行为。

Method: 通过学习55个有害子概念的线性探针，构建了一个低秩的有害性子空间，并测试了从模型内部消融整个子空间以及在子空间的主导方向上进行引导和消融的效果。

Result: 主导方向引导可以在几乎消除有害性的同时，仅轻微降低模型的实用性。

Conclusion: 多维框架和概念子空间为理解和控制大型语言模型的有害行为提供了可扩展的视角，并为社区提供了审计和强化未来语言模型的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应可解释AI框架（AXTF），利用生理信号动态调整解释，以增强高风险环境中的人机信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景（如应急响应）中，现有可解释AI（XAI）方法通常提供统一解释且依赖显式反馈机制，难以满足高压力环境的需求。

Method: 论文提出了一个概念框架，利用生理和行为信号（如EEG、ECG和眼动追踪）推断用户状态，并基于多目标个性化信任估计模型动态调整解释特征。

Result: AXTF通过隐式反馈和个性化信任估计模型，实现了对解释的动态调整，从而促进了人与AI协作中的快速信任。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种自适应可解释性信任框架（AXTF），通过非侵入性方式实时响应用户的认知和情感状态，以增强高风险环境中人与AI之间的快速信任。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

*Zhihao Peng,Liuxin Bao,Shengyuan Liu,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出自适应LLM集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性机制优化医疗决策支持能力，实验证明其效果优于现有方法（如GPT-4）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作方法缺乏明确的组件选择规则，且依赖预定义的LLM集群，导致部分LLMs在医疗决策支持场景中表现不佳，影响了协作效果。

Method: 论文提出了两种机制：1）自多样性——通过计算LLM内部成对输出的模糊匹配值作为自多样性值，优先选择高自多样性值的LLMs作为集群组件；2）跨一致性——测量最高自多样性LLM与其他LLMs的跨一致性值，逐步屏蔽一致性最低的LLM以避免输出不一致。

Result: 在两个专科医疗数据集（NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health）上的实验显示，该方法在所有学科中均达到或超过公开官方及格分数，尤其在妇产科领域以65.47%的准确率优于GPT-4的56.12%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗决策支持中的能力。实验证明该方法在专科医疗数据集上表现优异，甚至在某些学科上超过了GPT-4的表现。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式能源在主动配电网中的渗透率增加，但新集成的ADN运营商缺乏专业知识和技能，依赖人工专家成本高且耗时，因此需要智能、灵活的调度解决方案。

Method: 将ADN调度问题分解为多个阶段，设计多LLM协作架构，包括信息提取器、问题建模器和代码编程器，并为每个LLM代理开发定制优化技术。

Result: 通过全面的测试案例验证了所提架构和方法的有效性，用户可通过自然语言查询快速生成调度策略，消除技术障碍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了ADN调度的准确性和可靠性，为缺乏专业知识的运营商提供了高效、用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub仓库的README文件内容不完整可能影响其潜力的发挥，本研究旨在通过自动分类README文件内容来提升其采纳和使用率。

Method: 研究采用了三种编码器型LLMs（BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa），并基于包含4226个README文件片段的黄金标准数据集进行微调。此外，还探索了参数高效微调技术（PEFT）如LoRA的使用。

Result: 该方法在整体F1分数上达到了0.98，优于现有最先进方法，同时PEFT技术提供了经济高效的替代方案。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了利用LLMs（如BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa）对GitHub README文件进行自动分类的潜力，为改进GitHub仓库的识别和使用提供了自动化工具。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

Result: 通过在三数据集、六种大型语言模型和五种偏见类型上的一系列综合实验，证明该框架在揭示复杂偏见模式方面具有显著更高的能力和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的结合知识图谱和辅助大型语言模型的新框架，显著提高了揭示医学大型语言模型中复杂偏见模式的能力和可扩展性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Conclusion: 本文讨论了由AI代理驱动的Agentic Web的潜力、社会风险及治理问题，并提出了开发开放、安全和智能生态系统的研究方向。

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

TL;DR: 该论文研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在解释问题时的组合能力，通过生成不同难度的数据集并实验评估，发现LLMs在系统性和组合性解释问题上表现不佳，性能随复杂度增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional.

Method: Generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Conduct experiments with models of different sizes using various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning.

Result: Performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于LLM的编码助手通过生成澄清问题，显著提高了代码生成的准确性和帮助性，优于基准编码助手。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

*Aryan Raj,Astitva Veer Garg,Anitha D*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结构化相关性评估框架，通过改进文档评估、平衡内外知识整合和处理不可回答查询，显著降低了检索增强语言模型的幻觉率并提升了可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强语言模型（RALM）在减少事实错误方面面临重大挑战，特别是在文档相关性评估和知识整合方面。

Method: 我们采用了一个多维评分系统，结合语义匹配和来源可靠性，利用基于嵌入的相关性评分和混合质量文档的合成训练数据。

Result: 初步评估显示幻觉率显著降低，推理过程透明度提高。

Conclusion: 尽管在准确区分可信信息和平衡系统延迟与全面性方面仍存在挑战，但这项工作在提升检索增强语言模型（RALM）可靠性方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

TL;DR: Trans-ACT通过交易分析原则增强多智能体系统的心理真实性，实验验证其能提升交互深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统缺乏对人类行为认知复杂性的模拟，Trans-ACT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: Trans-ACT将Parent、Adult和Child三种自我状态嵌入智能体的认知架构中，利用情境特定记忆生成响应，并根据生活脚本选择最终行为。

Result: 实验模拟（Stupid游戏场景）表明，基于认知和TA原则的智能体能产生更深层次的情境感知交互。

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为多智能体系统引入了基于交易分析的心理动力学，展示了在冲突解决、教育支持和高级社会心理学研究中的潜在应用。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

TL;DR: AI工具（尤其是交互式使用）在复杂标注任务中显著提升速度和准确性，节省时间，标注者技能是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI检索增强生成（RAG）工具在复杂信息提取和标注任务中的有效性，以解决现实世界中信息异构且不完整的挑战。

Method: 采用随机任务分配的受试者内设计，比较了两种AI使用条件（"naive"和"interactive"）与纯人工基线的表现。任务涉及对全球系统重要性银行（GSIBs）的公开披露文档进行复杂标注。

Result: AI工具将任务执行速度提升高达10倍，并提高了准确性，交互式条件表现更优。预计全任务可节省268小时。标注者的AI工具使用技能影响任务性能。

Conclusion: 使用AI工具（尤其是交互式条件）在信息提取和数据标注任务中显著提高了效率和准确性，节省了大量时间，同时标注者的技能（包括领域知识和AI工具使用能力）是影响性能的关键因素。

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理面临需求波动、库存不平衡和牛鞭效应等挑战，传统方法难以应对动态市场条件，而现有的机器学习技术又存在计算复杂性和训练效率等问题。

Method: 研究引入了一种结合LNN的动态特征提取和XGBoost的全局优化能力的混合模型，以减轻牛鞭效应并提高累积盈利能力。

Result: 该模型通过LNN和XGBoost的协同作用，旨在满足供应链管理中适应性和效率的双重需求。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种混合LNN和XGBoost模型，用于优化多级供应链中的订购策略，填补了现有方法在动态和高效供应链管理中的关键空白。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种主动信息收集的任务范式，通过强化微调策略训练大语言模型识别上下文缺失并主动提问，显著提升了模型的协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在面对不完整或未明确提示时往往表现被动，无法主动收集缺失信息，这限制了高质量解决方案的生成。

Method: 研究设计了一个可扩展的框架，生成部分指定的现实任务，掩盖关键信息并模拟真实的模糊性，核心创新是通过强化微调策略奖励那些能引出真正新信息的提问。

Result: 实验表明，经过训练的Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估指标上显著优于o3-mini模型18%，人类评估中其澄清问题和最终提纲的偏好率分别为42%和28%。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了主动澄清在提升大语言模型从被动文本生成器转变为真正协作思维伙伴中的价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量方法，能更准确地预测LLM在问答任务中的表现，优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任大型语言模型的输出对模型对齐至关重要。现有方法（如语义熵）主要通过设置阈值来衡量语义等价关系，但缺乏对语义关系连续性的捕捉。

Method: 通过开发一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量方法，该方法捕捉语义关系的连续性，并验证了其满足三个基本性质。

Result: 实验表明，提出的Shapley不确定性在问答和其他数据集中比类似基线方法更准确地预测模型表现。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量方法，该方法能更准确地预测大型语言模型在问答任务中的表现，相比现有基线方法具有优势。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

TL;DR: Assistax是一个开源基准，利用JAX加速和多智能体强化学习，解决辅助机器人任务中的挑战，比传统方法快370倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏基准在强化学习研究中占主导地位，但它们往往无法直接应用于现实世界的具身交互场景，因此需要多样化基准以应对辅助机器人任务中的复杂性。

Method: 使用JAX的硬件加速进行物理模拟，通过多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练多样化的伙伴智能体。

Result: Assistax在向量化训练运行中比CPU替代方案快370倍，并为流行的连续控制RL和MARL算法提供了可靠的基线。

Conclusion: Assistax被确立为一个实用的基准，用于推动辅助机器人领域的强化学习研究。

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

Abstract: Current evaluations of LLMs in the government domain primarily focus on
safety considerations in specific scenarios, while the assessment of the
models' own core capabilities, particularly domain relevance, remains
insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.
This work aims to enhance the capability evaluation framework for large models
in the government domain, providing an effective tool for relevant research and
practice. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: Evo-DKD是一种双解码器框架，结合结构化和非结构化知识，通过动态门控机制实现自主本体演化，实验证明其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决本体和知识图谱手动维护的高成本问题，利用LLMs的非结构化知识优势，同时克服其结构化一致性不足的挑战。

Method: 提出Evo-DKD框架，采用双解码器设计：一个生成候选本体编辑，另一个生成自然语言解释。通过动态注意力门控机制协调两个解码流，并在单流模式下模拟双解码行为。

Result: 实验表明，Evo-DKD在本体更新精度和下游任务性能上均优于仅使用结构化或非结构化解码的基线方法。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD提出了一种结合符号和神经推理的新范式，用于可持续的本体演化，通过双解码器设计和动态门控机制，有效结合了结构化和非结构化知识的优势。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究利用LLM驱动的框架，在低数据条件下实现了准确的红外光谱分析，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外光谱虽能快速、无损地测量化学和材料特性，但其高维度和重叠的光谱带对传统化学计量学方法构成挑战。大型语言模型（LLMs）因其泛化和推理能力，为自动化复杂科学工作流程提供了潜力，但在红外光谱分析中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究提出了一种集成了结构化文献知识库、自动光谱预处理、特征提取和多任务推理的统一管道框架。通过查询同行评审的红外光谱出版物，该框架选择科学验证过的例程，将光谱转换为低维特征集，并输入到少样本提示模板中进行分类、回归和异常检测。

Result: 在多种材料（如印泥墨水、中草药、普洱茶、陈皮和废水COD数据集）上，多轮LLM推理的表现优于单轮推理，并在低数据情况下与机器学习及深度学习模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入一个端到端的大型语言模型驱动框架，成功解决了在低数据条件下实现准确、自动化的红外光谱解释的挑战。该框架在多任务推理中表现优异，尤其在低数据情况下，其性能与机器学习及深度学习模型相当或更优。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

### [150] [Large Language Models for Supply Chain Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21502)
*David Simchi-Levi,Konstantina Mellou,Ishai Menache,Jeevan Pathuri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs通过自动化和数据驱动的方式，显著提升了供应链管理的决策效率和生产力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管计算和信息技术进步使得供应链决策更加自动化和数据驱动，但商业规划者和高管仍需花费大量时间理解技术推荐、分析场景和更新模型，这显著拖慢了决策速度。

Method: 应用大型语言模型（LLMs）来理解和解释供应链工具的推荐结果，分析不同场景并回答假设性问题，以及更新数学模型以反映当前商业环境。

Result: LLMs的应用成功解决了上述三个挑战，显著减少了决策时间并提高了生产力。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型（LLMs）能够显著提升供应链管理的决策效率，将决策时间从数天或数周缩短至几分钟或几小时，同时大幅提高规划者和高管的生产力与影响力。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉-语言任务中取得了显著进展，但其在视觉不可回答问题时的诚实行为尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 作者定义了四种代表性的视觉不可回答问题类型，并构建了包含12k+样本的MoHoBench基准。通过多阶段过滤和人工验证确保数据质量，评估了28种流行MLLMs的诚实行为。

Result: 实验结果表明：（1）大多数模型在必要时无法适当拒绝回答；（2）MLLMs的诚实行为不仅与语言建模相关，还受视觉信息影响。作者提出的对齐方法为未来研究提供了基础。

Conclusion: 本文提出了第一个系统性评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）诚实行为的方法，并构建了大规模基准MoHoBench。通过实验，作者发现大多数模型在视觉不可回答问题时表现不佳，且诚实行为受到视觉信息的显著影响。作者还提出了初步的对齐方法，为未来可信赖的MLLMs研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Result: 提出了一套精确的标准，用于判断神经网络是否学习和使用了'世界模型'，并确保该模型不是数据或任务的平凡结果。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个明确的定义和标准，以判断神经网络是否学习和使用了'世界模型'，为实验研究提供了共同的语言基础。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in reasoning, generalization,
and zero-shot learning. These strengths open new frontiers in wireless
communications, where increasing complexity and dynamics demand intelligent and
adaptive solutions. This article explores the role of LLMs in transforming
wireless systems across three key directions: adapting pretrained LLMs for core
communication tasks, developing wireless-specific foundation models to balance
versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning
and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case
studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional
methods. Finally, we outline open challenges and research opportunities,
including multimodal fusion, collaboration with lightweight models, and
self-improving capabilities, charting a path toward intelligent, adaptive, and
autonomous wireless networks of the future.

Motivation: 当前AI解释通常关注导致特定输出的内部机制，这种解释方式对非专家用户不友好。为了促进以人为中心的AI解释视角，需要关注个体偏好和解释的上下文环境。

Method: 提出了一种智能体的世界观模型，该模型作为其与同一用户先前互动的个人和动态记忆，基于此智能体可以估计其知识中哪些部分对用户最有可能是新信息。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种个性化的AI解释方法，通过智能体根据用户偏好和上下文动态调整解释内容，以提高非专家用户的理解和接受度。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Method: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）和知识图谱的检索增强生成（SafeDriveRAG）方法，并引入多尺度子图检索算法以提高信息检索效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，SafeDriveRAG在五种主流视觉语言模型上显著提升了性能，尤其在交通意外、极端案例和交通安全常识任务中分别提升了4.73%、8.79%和14.57%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了SafeDrive228K基准和SafeDriveRAG方法，显著提升了视觉语言模型在交通安全关键任务中的表现，证明了其在自动驾驶系统中的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Motivation: 解决音频-视觉多任务增量学习中如何保留旧任务知识并促进新任务学习的挑战。

Method: PHP方法包含三个阶段：浅层阶段设计了任务共享模态聚合适配器；中层阶段提出了任务特定模态共享动态生成适配器；深层阶段引入了任务特定模态独立提示。

Result: PHP在不同顺序的四个任务（AVE、AVVP、AVS和AVQA）上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PHP方法通过三个阶段的设计，有效平衡了知识共享与任务特异性，在多个音频-视觉任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Conclusion: 论文探讨了贝叶斯统计在当前具身智能系统中未被广泛应用的现状，并指出了贝叶斯方法在扩展这些系统以实现真正的开放物理世界具身智能方面的潜力。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 团队中引入可读性决策的代理能提升协作性能，优于仅使用标准最优行为的代理团队。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

Method: 提出了自我意识安全增强（SASA）技术，通过将中间层的语义表征投影到早期的安全导向层，无需微调即可增强安全性识别。

Result: 实验表明，SASA在各种数据集和任务中显著提高了LVLMs的安全性，且对实用性影响较小。

Conclusion: SASA技术通过利用大视觉语言模型的内在语义理解能力，显著提升了模型的安全性，同时对实用性影响最小。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full

Conclusion: BellNet提出了一种新的动态规划方法，通过将策略迭代展开并截断为可学习的参数模型，有效减少了计算复杂度，并在网格环境中初步验证了其优于传统方法的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Conclusion: GDAIP框架通过整合图注意力网络和最小最大熵域适应方法，成功解决了跨数据集场景下的个体脑区分割问题，展现出拓扑合理的边界、强跨会话一致性及功能组织反映能力。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI, has driven significant advancements in high-risk
sectors like healthcare and finance. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
architecture, combining language models (LLMs) with search engines, is
particularly notable for its ability to generate responses from document
corpora. Despite its potential, the reliability of RAG systems in critical
contexts remains a concern, with issues such as hallucinations persisting. This
study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We
propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge
annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed
citations, and abstentions. Inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI)
method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical
guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our
contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems
evaluation protocols in industrial applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的观测数据通常来自不同环境，具有异质性因果关系，现有方法仅使用单一因果机制。

Method: 结合高斯混合模型和神经网络的拟合能力，利用混合条件变分自编码器的概率界限作为因果决策标准。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，MCVCI和MCVCC方法表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCVCI和MCVCC方法在模拟和真实数据上表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

<details>

Motivation: FlowGRPO等方法因需要在MDP中采样和优化所有去噪步骤而效率低下，MixGRPO旨在通过混合采样策略优化这一过程。

Method: MixGRPO通过混合随机微分方程（SDE）和常微分方程（ODE）采样策略，引入滑动窗口机制，限制采样随机性在窗口内，减少优化开销。MixGRPO-Flash进一步支持高阶求解器，提升训练效率。

Conclusion: MixGRPO和MixGRPO-Flash在人类偏好对齐的图像生成任务中表现出色，显著提升了效率和性能，训练时间分别减少了50%和71%。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

Conclusion: DualSG通过将大语言模型作为语义引导模块，而非独立预测器，成功结合了数值预测和语义引导，显著提升了多元时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

<details>

Motivation: 在多智能体环境中，有效的交互依赖于理解其他智能体的信念和意图。传统目标识别研究将观察者视为被动推理者，而主动目标识别（AGR）则侧重于策略性地收集信息以减少不确定性。

Method: 采用概率框架，提出了一种结合联合信念更新机制和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）算法的集成解决方案，使观察者能够高效规划并推断行动者的隐藏目标，无需领域特定知识。

Result: 在基于网格的领域中进行的全面实证评估表明，联合信念更新显著优于被动目标识别，且领域无关的MCTS表现与领域特定的贪婪基线相当。

Conclusion: 本文提出的联合信念更新机制与蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）算法相结合的解决方案，为多智能体环境中的目标推断提供了一个实用且鲁棒的框架，推动了该领域向更具交互性和适应性的方向发展。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Conclusion: MultiEditor通过双分支潜在扩散框架有效解决了自动驾驶系统中多模态感知数据的编辑问题，显著提升了视觉和几何保真度、编辑可控性及跨模态一致性，并增强了感知模型对稀有类别车辆的检测准确性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种强大的神经符号方法，结合了图神经网络（GNNs）和关系贝叶斯网络（RBNs）的优势，为图数据提供了一种新的学习和推理框架。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种不依赖大型语言模型（LLM）提示的零样本人类活动识别（HAR）方法，通过自然语言建模传感器数据和活动，利用其嵌入进行零样本分类，解决了现有方法在隐私、外部服务依赖和预测一致性方面的风险。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PHAX是一个结合论证和可解释性的框架，旨在为公共卫生AI系统提供透明、个性化的解释，增强不同利益相关者的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释AI方法在适应多样化健康利益相关者（如临床医生、政策制定者和公众）方面缺乏结构和适应性。

Method: PHAX是一个多层架构，结合了可废止推理、自适应自然语言技术和用户建模，生成上下文感知、针对特定受众的论证。

Result: PHAX通过用例（如医学术语简化、医患沟通和政策论证）展示了其适用性，论证链和个性化简化决策提高了可解释性和信任。

Conclusion: PHAX框架通过结合形式推理方法和沟通需求，为公共卫生领域提供了透明、以人为中心的AI解决方案，增强了可解释性和信任。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理训练和推理技术在推理设计、无效奖励和视觉噪声方面存在不足，UI-AGILE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1) 提出了Continuous Reward函数以激励高精度定位；2) 设计了'Simple Thinking'奖励以平衡规划、速度和定位准确性；3) 采用了Cropping-based Resampling策略以缓解稀疏奖励问题并提升复杂任务学习效果。推理阶段引入了Decomposed Grounding with Selection方法，通过将图像分解为更小部分来提升高分辨率显示下的定位准确性。

Result: UI-AGILE在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中比最佳基线提升了23%的定位准确性。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE框架显著提升了GUI代理的训练和推理性能，在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中达到了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

TL;DR: UserBench基准评估LLM代理在模糊目标下的协作能力，发现现有模型在用户意图对齐和偏好揭示方面表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在模糊、动态或间接表达目标下的协作能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入UserBench基准，模拟用户逐步揭示偏好的多轮交互，评估代理的主动澄清意图和工具使用能力。

Result: 评估显示，LLM代理在任务完成与用户意图对齐之间存在显著差距，高级模型仅能揭示不到30%的用户偏好。

Conclusion: UserBench提供了一个交互式环境，用于衡量和提升LLM代理在模糊、动态目标下的协作能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Steiner Orientation 问题在结构参数化复杂度下表现出高复杂性，多项参数化算法被提出并证明其最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 Steiner Orientation 问题在结构参数化复杂度框架下的复杂性，以揭示其在标准度量（如树宽度）下的难解性，并为实际应用提供理论指导。

Method: 通过结构参数化复杂度分析，研究了 Steiner Orientation 在不同参数（如树宽度、顶点覆盖数、边数）下的复杂性。提出了多项算法，包括基于顶点覆盖数的 XP 算法和基于边数的指数时间算法。

Result: (1) 证明 Steiner Orientation 在树宽度为 2、路径宽度为 3 等情况下是 NP 完全的；(2) 提出基于顶点覆盖数的 XP 算法，并证明其时间复杂度的最优性；(3) 基于边数的参数化分析，展示了最优的指数时间算法。

Conclusion: Steiner Orientation 问题在结构参数化复杂度视角下表现出较高的复杂性，尤其是在树宽度、路径宽度等标准度量下。尽管存在一些参数化算法（如基于顶点覆盖数的 XP 算法），但问题的时间复杂度下限表明其本质上是难解的。

Abstract: We consider the \textsc{Steiner Orientation} problem, where we are given as
input a mixed graph $G=(V,E,A)$ and a set of $k$ demand pairs $(s_i,t_i)$,
$i\in[k]$. The goal is to orient the undirected edges of $G$ in a way that the
resulting directed graph has a directed path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ for all
$i\in[k]$. We adopt the point of view of structural parameterized complexity
and investigate the complexity of \textsc{Steiner Orientation} for standard
measures, such as treewidth. Our results indicate that \textsc{Steiner
Orientation} is a surprisingly hard problem from this point of view. In
particular, our main contributions are the following: (1) We show that
\textsc{Steiner Orientation} is NP-complete on instances where the underlying
graph has feedback vertex number 2, treewidth 2, pathwidth 3, and vertex
integrity 6; (2) We present an XP algorithm parameterized by vertex cover
number $\mathrm{vc}$ of complexity $n^{\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{vc}^2)}$.
Furthermore, we show that this running time is essentially optimal by proving
that a running time of $n^{o(\mathrm{vc}^2)}$ would refute the ETH; (3) We
consider parameterizations by the number of undirected or directed edges ($|E|$
or $|A|$) and we observe that the trivial $2^{|E|}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time
algorithm for the former parameter is optimal under the SETH. Complementing
this, we show that the problem admits a
$2^{\mathcal{O}(|A|)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm. In addition to the
above, we consider the complexity of \textsc{Steiner Orientation} parameterized
by $\mathrm{tw}+k$ (FPT), distance to clique (FPT), and $\mathrm{vc}+k$ (FPT
with a polynomial kernel).

TL;DR: 论文提出确定性及随机化算法，实现在线$(1 + o(1))\Delta$边着色，突破贪婪算法限制，匹配已知不可能性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于对Vizing定理在线版本中边着色问题的改进需求，特别是针对高$\Delta$值的情况，以验证Bar-Noy等人的猜想。

Method: 研究方法包括提出一种确定性在线算法和一种随机化算法，分别适用于不同范围的$\Delta$值。

Result: 研究结果表明，对于$\Delta = \omega(\log n)$的图，确定性算法可以实现在线$(1 + o(1))\Delta$边着色；而对于$\Delta = \omega(\sqrt{\log n})$的图，随机化算法也能达到相同的效果。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是，通过确定性和随机化算法，可以在线实现$(1 + o(1))\Delta$边着色，突破了贪婪算法的限制，并匹配了[BNMN IPL'92]的不可能性结果。

Abstract: Vizing's theorem guarantees that every graph with maximum degree $\Delta$
admits an edge coloring using $\Delta + 1$ colors. In online settings - where
edges arrive one at a time and must be colored immediately - a simple greedy
algorithm uses at most $2\Delta - 1$ colors. Over thirty years ago, Bar-Noy,
Motwani, and Naor [IPL'92] proved that this guarantee is optimal among
deterministic algorithms when $\Delta = O(\log n)$, and among randomized
algorithms when $\Delta = O(\sqrt{\log n})$. While deterministic improvements
seemed out of reach, they conjectured that for graphs with $\Delta =
\omega(\log n)$, randomized algorithms can achieve $(1 + o(1))\Delta$ edge
coloring. This conjecture was recently resolved in the affirmative: a $(1 +
o(1))\Delta$-coloring is achievable online using randomization for all graphs
with $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$ [BSVW STOC'24].
  Our results go further, uncovering two findings not predicted by the original
conjecture. First, we give a deterministic online algorithm achieving $(1 +
o(1))\Delta$-colorings for all $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$. Second, we give a
randomized algorithm achieving $(1 + o(1))\Delta$-colorings already when
$\Delta = \omega(\sqrt{\log n})$. Our results establish sharp thresholds for
when greedy can be surpassed, and near-optimal guarantees can be achieved -
matching the impossibility results of [BNMN IPL'92], both deterministically and
randomly.

Conclusion: 本文通过设计独立于任何次线性模型的算法，并在流式和查询模型中高效获取样本，同时建立了查询和流式模型中的首个下界，几乎解决了所有次线性模型中的问题复杂度。

Abstract: The degree distribution of a graph $G=(V,E)$, $|V|=n$, $|E|=m$ is one of the
most fundamental objects of study in the analysis of graphs as it embodies
relationship among entities. In particular, an important derived distribution
from degree distribution is the complementary cumulative degree histogram
(ccdh). The ccdh is a fundamental summary of graph structure, capturing, for
each threshold $d$, the number of vertices with degree at least $d$. For
approximating ccdh, we consider the $(\varepsilon_D,\varepsilon_R)$-BiCriteria
Multiplicative Approximation, which allows for controlled multiplicative slack
in both the domain and the range. The exact complexity of the problem was not
known and had been posed as an open problem in WOLA 2019 [Sublinear.info,
Problem 98].
  In this work, we first design an algorithm that can approximate ccdh if a
suitable vertex sample and an edge sample can be obtained and thus, the
algorithm is independent of any sublinear model. Next, we show that in the
streaming and query models, these samples can be obtained efficiently. On the
other end, we establish the first lower bounds for this problem in both query
and streaming models, and (almost) settle the complexity of the problem across
both the sublinear models.

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate
dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as
delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction.
In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated
tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded
air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,
transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes
within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile
sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials
or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material
fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric
model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately
predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the
fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,
demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile
feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading
conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of
simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for
versatile robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的扩散去噪辅助陀螺罗盘方法显著提高了低成本陀螺仪的罗盘精度，为自主平台导航系统提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe
navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide
accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a
process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using
low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where
external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly
addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size,
weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements
severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we
propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a
diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading
estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals
before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing.
Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our
proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to
model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven
approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring
accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate
low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a powerful approach for
controlling highly dynamic robotic systems, as it accounts for system dynamics
and optimizes control inputs at each step. However, its high computational
complexity makes implementation on resource-constrained microcontrollers
impractical. While recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of Model
Predictive Control (MPC) with linearized dynamics on microcontrollers, applying
full NMPC remains a significant challenge. This work presents an efficient
solution for generating and deploying NMPC on microcontrollers (NMPCM) to
control quadrotor UAVs. The proposed method optimizes computational efficiency
while maintaining high control accuracy. Simulations in Gazebo/ROS and
real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach,

adaptively manage energy and time constraints, we introduce an extended Monte
Carlo Tree Search approach that strategically optimizes both modality selection
and viewpoint sequencing. Combined with an improved bimodal vehicle motion
planner, we present a complete bimodal energy- and time-aware exploration
system. Extensive simulations and deployment on a customized real-world
platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

Motivation: 探索穿戴者在学习使用机器人腿时，感知身体图像与实际步态改善的协同进化关系。

Method: 通过测量步态表现和感知身体图像（使用SCoMo指标），基于扩展至穿戴者-机器人系统的人类运动学习理论进行实验。

Result: 实验证实运动学习改善了身体和感知的步态模式，但感知与实际运动间存在持续差异，可能源于穿戴者缺乏对假肢的直接感觉和控制。

Conclusion: 研究发现，增强对可穿戴机器人的人体感知和频繁校准身体图像感知对于有效训练下肢可穿戴机器人及开发更具身性的辅助技术至关重要。

Abstract: Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human
motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability,
and perception of their own bodies. We measured gait performance and perceived
body images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each
training session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot
systems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking
with a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more
certain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor
learning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal,
indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into
their sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination.
However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained,
likely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis
from wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training
sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that
enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequent calibrating
perception of body image are essential for effective training with lower limb
wearable robots and for developing more embodied assistive technologies.

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在1dB信噪比下平均角度误差为4度，95%的情况下误差在5度内。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的声源定位策略在嘈杂环境中显著优于现有技术，实现了平均4度的角度误差，并在1dB信噪比下达到95%的5度内准确率。

Abstract: This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a
microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous
close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy
is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate
a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from
interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source
localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound
from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios.
Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within
5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly
superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何利用软体机器人的非线性动力学特性，通过物理储层计算框架嵌入和控制多个行为，揭示了未训练吸引子的存在及其对具身认知研究的潜在影响。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be
utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical
reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such
physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to
compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own
behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and
embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called
a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the
environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different
attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis
reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the
system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the
intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its
interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC
remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential
to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully
addressed to date.

TL;DR: 提出基于Decision Transformer的无人机轨迹规划器，用RTG参数动态调整安全与效率权衡，仿真和实际实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多项式规划器需专家调参且难以达到理想权衡，而强化学习规划器未显式解决安全与效率的权衡。

Method: 采用Decision Transformer框架，引入Return-to-Go（RTG）作为温度参数，动态调整安全与效率的权衡。通过Gazebo仿真在结构化和非结构化环境中验证。

Result: 实验表明，该规划器能通过RTG动态调整权衡，并在不同RTG设置下优于基线方法，生成更安全或更高效的轨迹。

Conclusion: 论文提出的基于Decision Transformer的轨迹规划器通过单一参数RTG动态调整安全与效率的权衡，在仿真和实际实验中均验证了其可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多楼层室内探索是一个开放的研究领域，现有的学习方法大多局限于2D环境。

Method: 提出了一种学习集成的拓扑探索器LITE，通过将环境分解为楼层-楼梯拓扑结构，并结合基于YOLO11的实例分割模型和有限状态机实现楼层间过渡。还实现了基于注意力的2D探索策略。

Result: 在HM3D和MP3D数据集上的实验表明，LITE的2D探索策略在探索效率上显著优于所有基线方法，并且在多个3D多楼层环境中兼容多种2D探索方法。

Conclusion: LITE框架在真实世界的四足机器人上验证了其强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open
area of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based
explorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust
environmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D
environments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological
explorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the
environment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of
learning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we
incrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based
instance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a
finite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D
exploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial
dependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global
goal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies
conducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D
exploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor
environments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D
exploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration.
Finally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot,
highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在样本效率、分布外泛化和鲁棒性方面有显著提升，并在模拟控制基准和真实世界导航实验中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文通过将逆强化学习中的策略替换为基于规划的代理，实现了从仅观察演示中端到端交互式学习规划器的方法，显著提高了样本效率、分布外泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,
out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes
evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation
experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

Conclusion: UniDomain 通过从机器人操作演示中预训练 PDDL 领域，并在在线机器人任务规划中应用，显著提升了任务成功率和计划最优性。

Abstract: Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires reasoning over
implicit constraints from language and vision. While LLMs and VLMs offer strong
priors, they struggle with long-horizon structure and symbolic grounding.
Existing methods that combine LLMs with symbolic planning often rely on
handcrafted or narrow domains, limiting generalization. We propose UniDomain, a
framework that pre-trains a PDDL domain from robot manipulation demonstrations
and applies it for online robotic task planning. It extracts atomic domains
from 12,393 manipulation videos to form a unified domain with 3137 operators,
2875 predicates, and 16481 causal edges. Given a target class of tasks, it
retrieves relevant atomics from the unified domain and systematically fuses
them into high-quality meta-domains to support compositional generalization in
planning. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show that UniDomain solves
complex, unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner, achieving up to 58% higher task
success and 160% improvement in plan optimality over state-of-the-art LLM and
LLM-PDDL baselines.

research areas still under-explored.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for
extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility
beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from
both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as
limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant
technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features
two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end
planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the
challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established
a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper
describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research
problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and
heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among
top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication
and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and
reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的场景-对象可靠性评估框架和姿态优化策略显著提高了动态环境下的SLAM定位精度和系统鲁棒性，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a vital role in
real-time localization for autonomous systems. However, traditional SLAM
methods, which assume a static environment, often suffer from significant
localization drift in dynamic scenarios. While recent advancements have
improved SLAM performance in such environments, these systems still struggle
with localization drift, particularly due to abrupt viewpoint changes and
poorly characterized moving objects. In this paper, we propose a novel
scene-object-based reliability assessment framework that comprehensively
evaluates SLAM stability through both current frame quality metrics and scene
changes relative to reliable reference frames. Furthermore, to tackle the lack
of error correction mechanisms in existing systems when pose estimation becomes
unreliable, we employ a pose refinement strategy that leverages information
from reliable frames to optimize camera pose estimation, effectively mitigating
the adverse effects of dynamic interference. Extensive experiments on the TUM
RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements
in localization accuracy and system robustness under challenging dynamic
scenarios.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于最小边RRT?算法的高效约束搜索方法和分布式模型预测控制策略，用于多无人机在障碍物密集环境中的可靠通信网络部署和运动协调，确保了无碰撞和持续的视线连接。

Abstract: A reliable communication network is essential for multiple UAVs operating
within obstacle-cluttered environments, where limited communication due to
obstructions often occurs. A common solution is to deploy intermediate UAVs to
relay information via a multi-hop network, which introduces two challenges: (i)
how to design the structure of multihop networks; and (ii) how to maintain
connectivity during collaborative motion. To this end, this work first proposes
an efficient constrained search method based on the minimumedge RRT? algorithm,
to find a spanning-tree topology that requires a less number of UAVs for the
deployment task. Then, to achieve this deployment, a distributed model
predictive control strategy is proposed for the online motion coordination. It
explicitly incorporates not only the inter-UAV and UAVobstacle distance
constraints, but also the line-of-sight (LOS) connectivity constraint. These
constraints are well-known to be nonlinear and often tackled by various
approximations. In contrast, this work provides a theoretical guarantee that
all agent trajectories are ensured to be collision-free with a teamwise LOS
connectivity at all time. Numerous simulations are performed in 3D valley-like
environments, while hardware experiments validate its dynamic adaptation when
the deployment position changes online.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,
real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials
remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various
benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid
objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address
mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.
  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation
Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.
MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both
elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge
inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires
effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as
the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and
demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,
highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by
deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot
robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that
MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving
deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos at

Abstract: Scientific testing techniques are essential for ensuring the safe operation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), with high-risk, highly interactive scenarios
being a primary focus. To address the limitations of existing testing methods,
such as their heavy reliance on high-quality test data, weak interaction
capabilities, and low adversarial robustness, this paper proposes ExamPPO, an
interactive adversarial testing framework that enables scenario-adaptive and
intensity-controllable evaluation of autonomous vehicles. The framework models
the Surrounding Vehicle (SV) as an intelligent examiner, equipped with a
multi-head attention-enhanced policy network, enabling context-sensitive and
sustained behavioral interventions. A scalar confrontation factor is introduced
to modulate the intensity of adversarial behaviors, allowing continuous,
fine-grained adjustment of test difficulty. Coupled with structured evaluation
metrics, ExamPPO systematically probes AV's robustness across diverse scenarios
and strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios and AV
strategies demonstrate that ExamPPO can effectively modulate adversarial
behavior, expose decision-making weaknesses in tested AVs, and generalize
across heterogeneous environments, thereby offering a unified and reproducible
solution for evaluating the safety and intelligence of autonomous
decision-making systems.

Abstract: Testing and evaluating automated driving systems (ADS) in interactions with
vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as cyclists, are essential for improving the
safety of VRUs, but often lack realism. This paper presents and validates a
coupled in-the-loop test environment that integrates a Cyclist-in-the Loop test
bench with a Vehicle-in-the-Loop test bench via a virtual environment (VE)
developed in Unreal Engine 5. The setup enables closed-loop, bidirectional
interaction between a real human cyclist and a real automated vehicle under
safe and controllable conditions. The automated vehicle reacts to cyclist
gestures via stimulated camera input, while the cyclist, riding a stationary
bicycle, perceives and reacts to the vehicle in the VE in real time. Validation
experiments are conducted using a real automated shuttle bus with a
track-and-follow function, performing three test maneuvers - straight-line
driving with stop, circular track driving, and double lane change - on a
proving ground and in the coupled in-the-loop test environment. The performance
is evaluated by comparing the resulting vehicle trajectories in both
environments. Additionally, the introduced latencies of individual components
in the test setup are measured. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach and highlight its strengths and limitations for realistic ADS
evaluation.

Abstract: One major recurring challenge in deploying manipulation robots is determining
the optimal placement of manipulators to maximize performance. This challenge
is exacerbated in complex, cluttered agricultural environments of high-value
crops, such as flowers, fruits, and vegetables, that could greatly benefit from
robotic systems tailored to their specific requirements. However, the design of
such systems remains a challenging, intuition-driven process, limiting the
affordability and adoption of robotics-based automation by domain experts like
farmers. To address this challenge, we propose a four-part design optimization
methodology for automating the development of task-specific robotic systems.
This framework includes (a) a robot design model, (b) task and environment
representations for simulation, (c) task-specific performance metrics, and (d)
optimization algorithms for refining configurations. We demonstrate our
framework by optimizing a dual-arm robotic system for pepper harvesting using
two off-the-shelf redundant manipulators. To enhance performance, we introduce
novel task metrics that leverage self-motion manifolds to characterize
manipulator redundancy comprehensively. Our results show that our framework
achieves simultaneous improvements in reachability success rates and
improvements in dexterity. Specifically, our approach improves reachability
success by at least 14\% over baseline methods and achieves over 30\%
improvement in dexterity based on our task-specific metric.

Abstract: Redundant manipulators are well understood to offer infinite joint
configurations for achieving a desired end-effector pose. The multiplicity of
inverse kinematics (IK) solutions allows for the simultaneous solving of
auxiliary tasks like avoiding joint limits or obstacles. However, the most
widely used IK solvers are numerical gradient-based iterative methods that
inherently return a locally optimal solution. In this work, we explore the
computation of self-motion manifolds (SMMs), which represent the set of all
joint configurations that solve the inverse kinematics problem for redundant
manipulators. Thus, SMMs are global IK solutions for redundant manipulators. We
focus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE
formulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE
integrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in
otherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by
one degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator. Furthermore,
recognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we
propose methods for searching for these separate SMM components. Our
formulations and algorithms compute accurate SMM solutions without requiring
additional IK refinement, and we extend our methods to prismatic joint systems
-- an area not covered in current SMM literature. This manuscript presents the
derivation of these methods and several examples that show how the methods work
and their limitations.

Abstract: Retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a minimally invasive microsurgical
procedure for treating retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a leading cause of vision
impairment. However, the small size and fragility of retinal veins, coupled
with the need for high-precision, tremor-free needle manipulation, create
significant technical challenges. These limitations highlight the need for
robotic assistance to improve accuracy and stability. This study presents an
automated robotic system with a top-down microscope and B-scan optical
coherence tomography (OCT) imaging for precise depth sensing. Deep
learning-based models enable real-time needle navigation, contact detection,
and vein puncture recognition, using a chicken embryo model as a surrogate for
human retinal veins. The system autonomously detects needle position and
puncture events with 85% accuracy. The experiments demonstrate notable
reductions in navigation and puncture times compared to manual methods. Our
results demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced imaging and deep
learning to automate microsurgical tasks, providing a pathway for safer and
more reliable RVC procedures with enhanced precision and reproducibility.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) combined with reduced-order template models
has emerged as a powerful tool for trajectory optimization in dynamic legged
locomotion. However, loco-manipulation tasks performed by legged robots
introduce additional complexity, necessitating computationally efficient MPC
algorithms capable of handling high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) models. This letter
presents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored
for loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic
manipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the
quadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples
locomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with
a full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control.
This decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in
a receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories
generated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear
whole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque
commands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control
architecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware
experiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg
4-DoF Kinova arm. Given that the Kinova arm dynamics are non-negligible
relative to the Go2 base, the proposed NMPC framework demonstrates robust
stability in performing diverse loco-manipulation tasks, effectively handling
external disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrain.

Conclusion: Mass-Spring Net框架通过直接从运动数据学习材料参数，有效模拟了复杂布料的空间变化特性，避免了FEM模拟中的膜锁定问题，并在训练速度、重建精度和泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial
variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing,
padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite
element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such
methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that
makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,
called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model
that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion
observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown
material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a
novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to
accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data
sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.
Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method
achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy,
and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: 3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to
deconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However,
current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring
considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a
novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing
for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart
of BANG is "Generative Exploded Dynamics", which creates a smooth sequence of
exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while
preserving their geometric and semantic coherence.
  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned
for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing
precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal
attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG
enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface
regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This
interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling
2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.
  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry,
associating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating
component-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG
offers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for
easy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation
from imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on
creation that resonates with human intuition.
