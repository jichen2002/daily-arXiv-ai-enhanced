Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at

TL;DR: 研究引入TRIG-Bench和TRIGScore填补图像生成模型多维度权衡研究的空白，提出DTM可视化模型能力权衡，并通过实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成模型在多维度（如质量、对齐、多样性、鲁棒性）上的权衡研究不足，主要由于缺乏细粒度量化数据集和单一评估指标的局限性。

Method: 研究引入了TRIG-Bench数据集和TRIGScore评估方法，提出了Relation Recognition System以生成Dimension Trade-off Map（DTM），并评估了14种模型在T2I和I2I任务上的表现。

Result: 实验证明DTM能够全面展示生成模型在不同维度上的权衡，且通过细调DTM可以缓解模型在特定维度上的弱点。

Conclusion: 通过TRIG-Bench和TRIGScore的引入，以及DTM的提出，研究不仅填补了图像生成模型在多维度权衡研究上的空白，还展示了如何通过细调DTM来提升模型性能。

Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation
often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and
robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have
rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained
quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for
multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in
Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,
Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains
40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we
develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various
dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I
and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to
generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among
model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently
provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for
each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's
dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to
enhance overall performance. Code is available at:

essential to feed the ever-growing global population. However, these sectors
face considerable challenges, including climate variability, resource
limitations, and the need for sustainable management. Addressing these issues
requires efficient, accurate, and scalable technological solutions,

### [4] [Color as the Impetus: Transforming Few-Shot Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22136)
*Chaofei Qi,Zhitai Liu,Jianbin Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过模拟人类色彩感知机制，提出ColorSense Learner和Distiller框架，显著提升小样本学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有元学习方法忽视色彩信息这一直观视觉特征，而人类色彩感知对元学习有重要作用。

Method: 提出ColorSense Learner框架，利用通道间特征提取和交互学习，结合ColorSense Distiller（基于知识蒸馏的元蒸馏器），增强网络的小样本学习能力。

Result: 在11个小样本基准测试中，方法表现出优异的泛化能力、鲁棒性和跨域性能。

Conclusion: ColorSense Learner和ColorSense Distiller通过模拟人类色彩感知机制，显著提升了小样本学习的性能，展现出极强的泛化能力、鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to
their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative
viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms.
We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that
capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By
strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels,
our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing
discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive
visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly
neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation
across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel
interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger
inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on
knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher
knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've
conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on
eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our
methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and
transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the
perspective of color perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 深度学习在儿童脑肿瘤分割中表现良好，尤其是对全肿瘤和T2高信号区域，但在增强肿瘤和囊性成分上仍需改进。研究支持简化MRI协议和自动化的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童脑肿瘤（PBTs）是儿童中最常见的实体恶性肿瘤，具有多样的组织学、分子亚型和影像特征，诊断和治疗面临挑战。基于深度学习的分割方法为肿瘤描绘提供了有前景的工具，但其在异质性PBT亚型和不同MRI协议中的性能尚不确定。

Method: 研究使用了一个回顾性单中心队列，包含174名患有高、低级别胶质瘤（HGG、LGG）、髓母细胞瘤（MB）、室管膜瘤等罕见亚型的儿童患者。MRI序列包括T1、T1增强（T1-C）、T2和FLAIR。手动标注了四个肿瘤亚区域：全肿瘤（WT）、T2高信号（T2H）、增强肿瘤（ET）和囊性成分（CC）。训练并测试了3D nnU-Net模型（121/53分割），使用Dice相似系数（DSC）评估分割性能，并与标注者内和标注者间变异性进行比较。

Result: 模型在全肿瘤（WT）和T2高信号（T2H）区域表现出色（平均DSC：0.85），与人类标注者变异性相当（平均DSC：0.86）。增强肿瘤（ET）分割中等准确（平均DSC：0.75），而囊性成分（CC）性能较差。分割准确性因肿瘤类型、MRI序列组合和位置而异。值得注意的是，仅使用T1、T1-C和T2序列的结果与完整协议几乎相当。

Conclusion: 深度学习（DL）在儿童脑肿瘤（PBTs）分割中具有可行性，尤其是在T2高信号（T2H）和全肿瘤（WT）区域表现出色。然而，增强肿瘤（ET）和囊性成分（CC）的分割仍存在挑战，需要进一步优化。这些发现支持简化协议和自动化的潜力，以提升体积评估并优化儿童神经肿瘤工作流程。

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,
encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and
outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade
gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation
offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across
heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A
retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,
medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI
sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual
annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),
T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D
nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation
performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared
against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust
performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator
variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean
DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by
tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2
alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL
is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and
CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings
support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance
volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

*Christian Ellis,Maggie Wigness,Craig Lennon,Lance Fiondella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 无监督地形分割方法Frontier-Seg，利用DINOv2和时间一致性处理，适用于非结构化环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖标注数据且在非结构化环境中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 利用DINOv2提取超像素级特征，并通过聚类和时间一致性处理实现分割。

Result: 在RUGD和RELLIS-3D等数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Frontier-Seg通过无监督方法实现了地形分割的时间一致性，适用于非结构化环境，无需人工标注。

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven
by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on
costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep
models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in
unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and
semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot
approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but
typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical
property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this
gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised
segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters
superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model
backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames
to identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human
supervision. We evaluate Frontier-Seg on a diverse set of benchmark
datasets-including RUGD and RELLIS-3D-demonstrating its ability to perform
unsupervised segmentation across unstructured off-road environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmartCLIP通过模块化对齐视觉与文本表示，解决了CLIP的信息错位和表示纠缠问题，提升了多任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本数据集上存在信息错位和表示纠缠问题，限制了其在某些下游任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 基于理论条件构建了一个框架，确保模型不仅能保留跨模态语义信息，还能解耦视觉表示以捕捉细粒度文本概念。随后提出了SmartCLIP方法，模块化地对齐相关表示。

Result: SmartCLIP在多个任务中表现优于现有方法，验证了其处理信息错位和支持识别理论的能力。

Conclusion: 论文提出的SmartCLIP方法通过模块化方式识别和对齐最相关的视觉与文本表示，有效解决了信息错位和表示纠缠问题，并在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

*Faisal Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOG-CNN模型结合手工和深度学习特征，在视网膜疾病筛查中表现出高效性和可解释性，适合临床部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视网膜疾病诊断依赖人工解读，耗时耗力，因此需要一种自动化和可解释的临床决策支持框架。

Method: 提出了一种基于HOG-CNN的混合特征提取模型，结合了手工的HOG特征和深度CNN特征，用于视网膜图像的自动分析。

Result: 在APTOS 2019、ORIGA和IC-AMD三个公开数据集上，HOG-CNN表现出色，尤其在DR分类和AMD诊断中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HOG-CNN模型通过结合手工特征和深度学习特征，展现出在视网膜疾病筛查中的高效性和可解释性，适合在资源有限的临床环境中部署。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

Abstract: Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected
around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort
required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to
considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels
into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model
yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial,
temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate
and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to
consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a
diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a
dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017
through 2024.

*Ziyi Wang,Peiming Li,Hong Liu,Zhichao Deng,Can Wang,Jun Liu,Junsong Yuan,Mengyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACTIVE是针对机器人视角的大规模动作识别数据集，提出了ACTIVE-PC方法解决远距离动作识别问题，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动作识别基准无法满足自然人机交互（N-HRI）的复杂需求，如数据、模态、任务类别及环境多样性不足。为应对这些挑战，开发了ACTIVE数据集。

Method: 提出了ACTIVE-PC方法，包括多级邻域采样（Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling）、分层识别器（Layered Recognizers）、弹性椭圆查询（Elastic Ellipse Query）以及精确解耦人类动作的运动干扰。

Result: ACTIVE数据集包含30个复合动作类别、80名参与者和46,868个标注视频实例，覆盖RGB和点云模态。ACTIVE-PC在实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: ACTIVE-PC方法通过多级邻域采样、分层识别器和弹性椭圆查询等技术，有效解决了远距离人机交互中的动作识别问题，实验证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our
code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出LAMA算法及其神经网络实现LAMA-Net，证明其收敛性并展示在稀疏视图CT中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是提供LAMA的完整收敛性证明，并展示其所有积累点必须是问题的Clarke稳定点，同时验证LAMA-Net的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种可学习的变分模型，结合图像和测量域的特征与互补信息进行图像重建。通过引入学习交替最小化算法（LAMA），在近端交替框架中整合残差学习架构，解决了双块非凸非光滑优化问题。

Result: LAMA直接产生了一个高度可解释的神经网络架构LAMA-Net，其收敛性带来了出色的稳定性和鲁棒性。整合初始生成网络（iLAMA-Net）进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net 在稀疏视图计算机断层扫描基准数据集上表现出色，展示了其稳定性、鲁棒性以及通过整合初始生成网络（iLAMA-Net）进一步提升性能的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and
leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for
image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating
minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual
learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our
goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show
that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke
stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable
neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the
results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property
of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work.
We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by
integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which
we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several
experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular
benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

TL;DR: 提出协作域适应框架（CDA），结合ViT和CNN，通过三阶段训练解决LLD检测中的小样本和域异质性问题，实验表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的LLD检测方法受限于样本量小和域异质性（如成像协议、扫描硬件差异），影响模型泛化能力。

Method: CDA框架结合Vision Transformer（ViT）和卷积神经网络（CNN），分三阶段训练：源数据监督训练、目标特征自监督适应及无标签目标数据协作训练。

Result: CDA在实验中显著优于当前最先进的无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的协作域适应（CDA）框架在多站点T1加权MRI数据上表现优于现有无监督域适应方法，为晚期抑郁症（LLD）的准确检测提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖理想视角输入，限制了在真实场景中的应用，因此需要一种能处理不理想视角的框架。

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）层增强预训练模型，引入高斯适配器模块提升几何一致性，并提出高斯对齐方法以渲染准确的目标视角。

Result: 在Google Scanned Objects和OmniObject3D数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效处理不理想视角输入。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架通过预训练模型、高斯适配器模块和新的训练策略，成功实现了在不理想视角下进行3D高斯渲染，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup
for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and
renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable
views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios
involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free
feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors
learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained
model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a
Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians
derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to
render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new
training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of
favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google
Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate
the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Method: DeltaVLM采用端到端架构，包括微调的双时相视觉编码器、带交叉语义关系测量（CSRM）机制的视觉差异感知模块，以及指令引导的Q-former。

Result: DeltaVLM在ChangeChat-105k数据集上训练，实验表明其在单轮描述和多轮交互式变化分析中均优于现有多模态大语言模型和遥感视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: DeltaVLM通过结合双时相视觉编码器、视觉差异感知模块和指令引导的Q-former，实现了在遥感图像变化分析中的最先进性能，支持单轮和多轮交互式分析。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite
imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods
typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their
ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we
introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that
combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to
enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal
remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a
large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid
rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change
captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question
answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM
features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to
capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a
cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and
(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant
difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual
instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large
language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize
efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that
DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning
and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal
large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset
and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统需要区分熟悉和陌生的面孔，这是实现人工通用智能（AGI）的关键能力。GFD 任务结合了传统人脸识别和广义类别发现（GCD），但面临高基数和细粒度 ID 的挑战。

Method: FaceGCD 通过轻量级、分层的前缀动态构建实例特定的特征提取器，这些前缀由 HyperNetwork 根据输入图像自适应生成。

Result: FaceGCD 在 GFD 任务中表现显著优于现有方法，包括 ArcFace 基线。

Conclusion: FaceGCD 在 GFD 任务中显著优于现有 GCD 方法和 ArcFace 基线，实现了最先进的性能，推动了开放世界人脸识别的进展。

Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a
critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper
introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face
recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized
category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled
known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen
IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high
cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD
approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method
that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using
lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a
HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned
on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle
identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms
existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face
recognition.

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with
large video datasets, video dataset distillation aims to capture spatial and
temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on
the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data.
We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video

essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30

but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注基于时间感知的原子交互和群体层次情感，缺乏对个体、群体和事件层次情感的细粒度综合分析。

Method: 采用多模态Swin-Transformer和S3Attention架构，结合场景、群体成员及上下文信息，联合预测个体、群体和事件层次的情感。

Result: GEMS能有效预测离散和连续情感（包括效价和唤醒度），以及个体、群体和事件层次的情感感知。

Conclusion: GEMS框架在VGAF-GEMS基准测试中表现优异，为多情感层次的综合分析提供了新思路，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

Motivation: 暴露视觉语言模型（VLMs）在频率域中细微、结构化扰动下的关键漏洞，以理解其对自动图像标注和DeepFake检测任务的影响。

Method: 设计了针对性的频率域图像变换，系统地调整VLM在频率扰动下的输出，并在五种最先进的VLM（包括Qwen2/2.5和BLIP模型）上验证了方法的通用性。

Result: 实验表明，VLM对基于频率的线索敏感，其判断可能与语义内容不完全一致，且视觉不可察觉的空间频率变换暴露了VLM的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在频率域中的脆弱性，挑战了其在自动图像标注和真实性检测任务中的可靠性，强调了构建鲁棒多模态感知系统的必要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for
visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection.
In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to
subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we
highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake
detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image
transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM
outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We
demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five
state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP
models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that
VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align
with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial
frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated
image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under
realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs,
underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

Motivation: 解决掩码自编码器（MAE）在训练中依赖掩码策略及在分布外数据上性能下降的问题。

Method: 结合隐式神经表示与掩码图像建模，MINR通过学习连续函数来表示图像，从而实现对不同掩码策略的鲁棒重建。

Result: MINR不仅在域内场景中优于MAE，还在分布外设置中表现更佳，同时降低了模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR框架作为一种鲁棒且高效的自监督学习替代方案，展现了其在多种应用中的潜力，尤其是在处理分布外数据时的优越性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, caused by frequency aliasing between fine repetitive
structures and a camera sensor's sampling process, have been a significant
obstacle in various real-world applications, such as consumer photography and
industrial defect inspection. With the advancements in deep learning
algorithms, numerous studies-predominantly based on convolutional neural
networks-have suggested various solutions to address this issue. Despite these
efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts
due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns,
primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures
limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e
patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring
images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns.
It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block
(MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large
Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and
Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together,
these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact
suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers
competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low
computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution
for real-world applications. Project page:

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs'
surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are
primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only
support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise
annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation
prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To
address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce
UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across
both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the
well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by
providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and
LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.
These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including
segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and
novel view synthesis (NVS). Our dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method using conditional flow matching captures uncertainty in medical image segmentation better than current diffusion-based approaches, providing reliable uncertainty maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current diffusion-based approaches in accurately capturing uncertainty due to their stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities.

Method: Leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based generative model, to learn exact densities and produce accurate segmentation samples.

Result: Achieves competitive segmentation accuracy and generates uncertainty maps that offer deeper insights into segmentation reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed method using conditional flow matching effectively captures aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation, providing reliable uncertainty maps that mirror inter-annotator differences.

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair
data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for
continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this
vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework
leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four
complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative
descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this
pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset
enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further
propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by
incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised
signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable
improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data
scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding
tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models
trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data
than ours. All code, data, and models are available at

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,
sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light
conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation
due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume
stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred
environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach
that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion
data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,
we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap
between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.
Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines
pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect
labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose
estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without
requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the
potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain
adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data
collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in
autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture
geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion
Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for
improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to
model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel
framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models
under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our
approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph
representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.
Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the
latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology
(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world
global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset
demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving
improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower
Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast
generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing
its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes

Conclusion: EDTR方法通过有效利用扩散先验，显著提升了任务性能与视觉质量，适用于多种复杂退化场景下的任务驱动图像恢复。

Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address
performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.
Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images
are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for
restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most
powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help
generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details
remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address
this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior
to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging
useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from
pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we
employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant
details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our
method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing
task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex
degradations.

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models
the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods
rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or
meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with
complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining
flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be
represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework
that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived
from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach
includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution
that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by
masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure
camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization
in zero-shot settings. Code and datasets are available at our project page:

Conclusion: SSGformer通过结合光谱分解和分组注意力机制，在多天气图像恢复中表现出色，有效处理了多样化和复杂的天气退化模式。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low
visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such
as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and
limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing
enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation
conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors
effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional
diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a
degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level
using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous
degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a
novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet
backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature
refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further
propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss
function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and
feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with
superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared
with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently

To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized
treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging
modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and
diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed
long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated
recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify
data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for
long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through
high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic
performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven
adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by
training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data
while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our
class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception
branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features
while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house
long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: COOkeD通过结合封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探测分类器的预测，实现了卓越的OOD检测性能，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

Conclusion: 本文提出的深度伪造检测算法在电子KYC系统中表现出色，能够全面检测面部交换和面部重现，并对图像退化具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically
designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the
reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to
develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping
and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address
these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates
the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity
vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive
detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to
processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to
be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the
registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that
employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both
detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our
experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face
swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various
forms of unseen image degradation. Our source code is publicly available

Motivation: 现有基于反向传播的方法由于计算成本高和梯度爆炸风险，难以实现完整的梯度反向传播，导致结果不理想。

Method: 采用轨迹保留的少步扩散模型构建更短的基于快捷方式的去噪链，优化该链以提升基础模型的微调效率和效果。

Result: ShortFT 在多种奖励函数上均能有效应用，显著提升对齐性能并超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT) 通过利用更短的去噪链显著提高了扩散模型与奖励函数对齐的效率和效果，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward
functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the
denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the
computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the
lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete
gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning
strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we
employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,
which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a
shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this
chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the
foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be
effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving
alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

Motivation: 多模态任务的复杂性和多样性导致现有模型在不同领域和难度下表现不稳定，需要改进。

Method: 采用多阶段渐进课程强化学习（PCuRL）框架，包括在线难度软加权机制和动态长度奖励机制。

Result: VL-Cogito在数学、科学、逻辑和通用理解等多模态基准测试中一致匹配或超越现有模型。

Conclusion: VL-Cogito通过PCuRL框架在多模态推理任务中表现出色，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决数据驱动的轨迹预测在罕见长尾场景中表现不佳的问题，传统方法通过修改模型架构，而本研究则通过优化训练过程来挖掘模型潜力。

Method: 提出了GALTraj框架，利用生成式主动学习和可控扩散模型主动识别并增强训练中的长尾样本。

Result: 在多个轨迹数据集（WOMD、Argoverse2）和主流模型（QCNet、MTR）上验证，GALTraj显著提升了长尾样本的性能，并提高了常见样本的准确性。

Conclusion: GALTraj通过改进训练过程而非模型架构，成功提升了自动驾驶系统在长尾场景下的轨迹预测性能，同时也在常见场景中表现出色。

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of
autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail
scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as
using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to
unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce
Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first
method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory
prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and
augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In
our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve
tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware
generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate
trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike
prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the
first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in
trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,
Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method
significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on
head samples.

Motivation: 时尚设计是一个复杂的创意过程，结合了视觉和文本表达。设计师通过草图传达想法，定义空间结构和设计元素，并通过文本描述捕捉材料、纹理和风格细节。

Method: LOTS利用全局描述与配对的局部草图+文本信息进行条件化，并引入了一种新颖的基于步骤的合并策略进行扩散适应。首先，模块化对中心表示将草图和文本编码到共享潜在空间中，同时保留独立的局部特征；然后，扩散对指导阶段通过扩散模型的多步去噪过程中的基于注意力的指导，整合了局部和全局条件。

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security
concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to
the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload
identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our
approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object
detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams,
deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be
specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality,
addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse
environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation
strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and
fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under
conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting
lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones
from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time
performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the
specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that
collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR
channels.

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual
points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods
typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale
annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local
transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global
structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a
graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for
realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics
from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation.
Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency
between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological
structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph.
Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our
framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to
consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various
models.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe
vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as
generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This
research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational
tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we
leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a
rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score
errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we
introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring
re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art
and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find
to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used
datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show
near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others,
highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation
models in anomaly detection.

Method: 该方法结合了可微分物理和图形学，无需对应点或大量监督数据，仅依赖图像的颜色特征、梯度和轮廓，以及网格的不可扩展性约束。

Result: 所提方法在重建速度上比现有最佳无监督SfT快400倍，且在生成细节和处理遮挡时表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种无监督的Shape-from-Template方法，通过仅使用图像观察（颜色特征、梯度和轮廓）以及网格不可扩展性约束，实现了比现有最佳无监督SfT方法快400倍的重建速度，并在处理细节和严重遮挡时表现更优。

Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the
3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template.
Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the
texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos
in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe
occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In
contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by
incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring
huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised
or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to
deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients
and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at
a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover,
when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method
outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing
prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a
fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known
algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite
their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences
originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture
of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,
event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a
unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point
correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By
formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a
constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence
relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D
points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its
general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing
modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can
even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the
effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we
show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent
approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and
motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at

Motivation: 现有的视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）在处理复杂和细粒度视觉信息时面临高训练和推理成本、视觉细节提取困难以及跨模态桥接挑战。

Method: 提出了一个名为MoCHA的新型视觉框架，整合了四种视觉主干网络（CLIP、SigLIP、DINOv2和ConvNeXt）以提取互补的视觉特征，并配备了稀疏专家混合连接器（MoECs）模块和分层组注意力（HGA）机制。

Result: MoCHA在Phi2-2.7B和Vicuna-7B上训练，性能优于现有开源模型。例如，在POPE上减少幻觉提升3.25%，在MME上提升153分。

Conclusion: MoCHA通过整合多种视觉主干网络和稀疏专家混合连接器（MoECs）模块，以及分层组注意力（HGA）机制，显著提升了视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）的性能，并在多个基准测试中超越了现有开源模型。消融研究进一步验证了MoECs和HGA的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

Motivation: 现有模型未能充分利用人类在导航时潜意识传达的视觉线索，因此研究使用人体姿态进行轨迹预测的益处。

Method: 提出了`Social-pose'，一种基于注意力的姿态编码器，能够有效捕捉场景中所有人的姿态及其社会关系。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多种预测架构（LSTM、GAN、MLP、Transformer）上均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 使用人体姿态（2D和3D）进行轨迹预测比仅使用笛卡尔空间位置更有效，特别是在机器人导航场景中。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for
autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to
fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when
navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human
trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space
locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder
that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social
relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction
architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over
all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians
and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the
advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses
and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRecover直接从中间特征恢复语义内容，无需图像重建，性能优越，并提出噪声保护方法减轻泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLMs）在分割DNN配置中的部署增加，中间特征的语义信息泄露风险上升。现有方法生成的图像模糊且语义不明确，因此需要直接解决语义泄露问题。

Method: 提出CapRecover框架，直接从中间特征恢复语义内容（如标签或标题），并评估其在多个数据集和模型上的表现。此外，提出了一种基于随机噪声的保护方法。

Result: CapRecover在CIFAR-10上达到92.71%的Top-1标签准确率，在COCO2017上生成的标题ROUGE-L得分达0.52。分析表明，深层卷积层比浅层编码更多语义信息。噪声保护方法有效防止语义泄露。

Conclusion: CapRecover提出了一种有效的跨模态反演框架，直接从中间特征中恢复高级语义内容，无需图像重建，并通过实验验证了其性能。同时，提出了一种简单但有效的保护方法，通过添加随机噪声来减轻语义泄露风险。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

increasingly challenging, exposing the limitations of current detection
techniques. In this paper, we present HOLA, our solution to the Video-Level
Deepfake Detection track of 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. Inspired by
the success of large-scale pre-training in the general domain, we first scale
audio-visual self-supervised pre-training in the multimodal video-level
deepfake detection, which leverages our self-built dataset of 1.81M samples,
thereby leading to a unified two-stage framework. To be specific, HOLA features
an iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual
interactions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under
the local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware
cross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised
singal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive
experiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation

Remarkably, our HOLA ranks 1st, outperforming the second by 0.0476 AUC on the

Abstract: Feature matching is a cornerstone task in computer vision, essential for
applications such as image retrieval, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, and
SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching,
exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep
learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth
images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language
interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and
descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate
intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps.
Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free
strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially
improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight
modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors
for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds,
attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions
like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal
applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language
tasks, underscore the evolution of feature matching to handle increasingly
diverse data interactions.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical
challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and
tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled
with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.
The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven
segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these
advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods
for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and
future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information
(past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from
the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation
mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In
doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to
the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also
discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and
trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error
accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for
future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the
field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of
VOST through the lens of foundation models.

Motivation: 深度神经网络容易受到特洛伊（后门）攻击，现有触发反演方法通常在特定假设下搜索全像素空间，无法保证估计的触发器不仅仅是翻转模型输出的对抗性扰动。

Method: 结合扩散生成器和目标分类器的引导，通过迭代生成与模型内部表示对齐的候选触发器。

Result: DISTIL在BackdoorBench数据集上实现了高达7.1%的准确率提升，并在特洛伊目标检测模型扫描中提高了9.4%，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DISTIL提出了一种无需数据、零样本触发的反演策略，通过限制搜索空间并避免对触发器外观的强假设，显著提高了触发器重建的准确性，为可靠的防御后门攻击提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious
concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A
common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious
"shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.
Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under
specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more
than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose
a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search
space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we
incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;
through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the
internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical
evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach
reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned
models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to
7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on
trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction
for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong
prior assumptions about triggers. The code is available at

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal
aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and
rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged
wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD
simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,
geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been
proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a
few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to
estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to
common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep
learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective
geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a
dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are
extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are
obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,
as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately
estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to
different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added
during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic
to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the
proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic
parameter estimation in clinical practice.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习和双层优化显著提升了AI生成人脸检测的性能，并在未见过的生成器上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on
synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to
emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we
pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of
linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable
image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of
artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative
weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of
manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.
In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate
goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains
fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian
mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight
two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in
both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong
generalization to unseen generators.

Method: DepR是一个深度引导的单视角场景重建框架，通过将实例级扩散整合到组合范式中，生成单个对象并将其组合成连贯的3D布局。它利用深度信息在训练和推理过程中编码形状先验，并通过深度引导的DDIM采样和布局优化增强重建与输入图像的对齐。

Result: DepR在有限的合成数据上训练，但在合成和真实数据集上均表现出色，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DepR在单视角场景重建中实现了最先进的性能，并在合成和真实数据集上展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework
that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm.
Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates
individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout.
Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation
during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric
information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference.
Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode
shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM
sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the
reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic
data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong
generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有基于自然语言的文本到代码生成方法难以捕捉空间布局和视觉设计意图，而实际UI开发通常是多模态的，需要从视觉草图或模型开始。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，结合视觉语言模型（VLM）检测UI组件，构建层次化布局，并通过自适应提示合成生成HTML/CSS代码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在布局准确性、结构连贯性和代码正确性上达到最先进水平，并通过扩展的数据引擎生成大规模图像-代码对，进一步优化了开源VLM。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种模块化多智能体框架，通过三个阶段（grounding、planning、generation）实现UI到代码的生成，显著提升了布局准确性、结构连贯性和代码正确性。

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available

Conclusion: TR-PTS通过联合优化参数和token选择，显著提升了计算效率和模型性能，在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but
are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating
only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are
task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads
to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we
propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven
framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most
informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining
parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically
preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing
computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS
enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We
evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%,
respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

Conclusion: OmniAVS和OISA的提出显著推进了Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation（RAVS）领域，特别是在多模态信息整合和深度理解推理方面。OISA在OmniAVS上的表现优于现有方法，并在其他相关任务中取得了竞争性结果。

Abstract: Referring audio-visual segmentation (RAVS) has recently seen significant
advancements, yet challenges remain in integrating multimodal information and
deeply understanding and reasoning about audiovisual content. To extend the
boundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose
Omnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset
containing 2,098 videos and 59,458 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS
stands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions
that flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on
understanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the
inclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,
we introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the
challenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of
audiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and
perform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA
outperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on
other related tasks.

### [70] [Settling Weighted Token Swapping up to Algorithmic Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22450)
*Nicole Wein,Guanyu,Zhang*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文首次提出了加权令牌交换问题的近似算法，针对树和一般图分别给出了紧的近似比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加权令牌交换问题在未加权情况下已有广泛研究，但加权情况下的近似算法尚未有成果。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究了加权令牌交换问题，通过分析令牌权重的最小值w和最大值W，提出了针对一般图和树的近似算法。

Result: 针对一般图和树，分别提出了近似比为2+2W/w和1+W/w的算法，并证明了这些算法的紧性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了加权令牌交换问题的首个近似算法，针对树和一般图分别给出了近似比为2+2W/w和1+W/w的算法，并提供了紧的障碍结果。

Abstract: We study the weighted token swapping problem, in which we are given a graph
on $n$ vertices, $n$ weighted tokens, an initial assignment of one token to
each vertex, and a final assignment of one token to each vertex. The goal is to
find a minimum-cost sequence of swaps of adjacent tokens to reach the final
assignment from the initial assignment, where the cost is the sum over all
swaps of the sum of the weights of the two swapped tokens. Unweighted token
swapping has been extensively studied: it is NP-hard to approximate to a factor
better than $14/13$, and there is a polynomial-time 4-approximation, along with
a tight "barrier" result showing that the class of locally optimal algorithms
cannot achieve a ratio better than 4. For trees, the problem remains NP-hard to
solve exactly, and there is a polynomial-time 2-approximation, along with a
tight barrier result showing that the class of $\ell$-straying algorithms
cannot achieve a ratio better than 2. Weighted token swapping with $\{0,1\}$
weights is much harder to approximation: it is NP-hard to approximate even to a
factor of $(1-\varepsilon) \cdot \ln n$ for any constant $\varepsilon>0$.
Restricting to positive weights, no approximation algorithms are known, and the
only known lower bounds are those inherited directly from the unweighted
version. We provide the first approximation algorithms for weighted token
swapping on both trees and general graphs, along with tight barrier results.
Letting $w$ and $W$ be the minimum and maximum token weights, our approximation
ratio is $2+2W/w$ for general graphs and $1+W/w$ for trees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在并发FIFO队列中保持严格的FIFO语义会导致高争用，从而降低吞吐量。通过放松FIFO语义，允许元素重新排序，可以提高可扩展性。

Method: 提出了两种正交的设计方案：一种基于MultiQueue，另一种基于环形缓冲区。

Result: 两种设计在各种微基准测试和大规模图的广度优先搜索应用中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 两种设计的松弛并发FIFO队列在高吞吐量和可扩展性方面优于现有松弛和严格的FIFO队列。

Abstract: FIFO queues are a fundamental data structure used in a wide range of
applications. Concurrent FIFO queues allow multiple execution threads to access
the queue simultaneously. Maintaining strict FIFO semantics in concurrent
queues leads to low throughput due to high contention at the head and tail of
the queue. By relaxing the FIFO semantics to allow some reordering of elements,
it becomes possible to achieve much higher scalability. This work presents two
orthogonal designs for relaxed concurrent FIFO queues, one derived from the
MultiQueue and the other based on ring buffers. We evaluate both designs
extensively on various micro-benchmarks and a breadth-first search application
on large graphs. Both designs outperform state-of-the-art relaxed and strict
FIFO queues, achieving higher throughput and better scalability.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: XGYRO通过优化模拟集合的内存共享，显著减少CGYRO在融合等离子体模拟中的内存和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CGYRO在融合等离子体模拟中的高内存和通信开销问题，尤其是在参数扫描模拟中。

Method: 开发了XGYRO工具，通过全局缓冲区分布逻辑和优化策略，共享碰撞常数张量结构，从而降低内存消耗。

Result: XGYRO显著减少了每个模拟的内存消耗，从而降低了整体通信开销。

Conclusion: XGYRO通过将整个模拟集合作为一个HPC作业执行，显著减少了内存消耗和通信开销，提升了融合等离子体模拟的效率。

Abstract: First-principles fusion plasma simulations are both compute and memory
intensive, and CGYRO is no exception. The use of many HPC nodes to fit the
problem in the available memory thus results in significant communication
overhead, which is hard to avoid for any single simulation. That said, most
fusion studies are composed of ensembles of simulations, so we developed a new
tool, named XGYRO, that executes a whole ensemble of CGYRO simulations as a
single HPC job. By treating the ensemble as a unit, XGYRO can alter the global
buffer distribution logic and apply optimizations that are not feasible on any
single simulation, but only on the ensemble as a whole. The main saving comes
from the sharing of the collisional constant tensor structure, since its values
are typically identical between parameter-sweep simulations. This data
structure dominates the memory consumption of CGYRO simulations, so
distributing it among the whole ensemble results in drastic memory savings for
each simulation, which in turn results in overall lower communication overhead.

Conclusion: 论文提出的半监督联邦学习框架在LEO卫星网络中显著减少了处理时间和能耗，同时保持了模型准确性。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as key components of 6G
networks, with many already deployed to support large-scale Earth observation
and sensing related tasks. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising
paradigm for enabling distributed intelligence in these resource-constrained
and dynamic environments. However, achieving reliable convergence, while
minimizing both processing time and energy consumption, remains a substantial
challenge, particularly in heterogeneous and partially unlabeled satellite
networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised
federated learning framework tailored for LEO satellite networks with
hierarchical clustering aggregation. To further reduce communication overhead,
we integrate sparsification and adaptive weight quantization techniques. In
addition, we divide the FL clustering into two stages: satellite cluster
aggregation stage and Ground Stations (GSs) aggregation stage. The supervised
learning at GSs guides selected Parameter Server (PS) satellites, which in turn
support fully unlabeled satellites during the federated training process.
Extensive experiments conducted on a satellite network testbed demonstrate that
our proposal can significantly reduce processing time (up to 3x) and energy
consumption (up to 4x) compared to other comparative methods while maintaining
model accuracy.

Motivation: 现有的Caliper工具无法捕获通信数据的详细度量及MPI进程信息，限制了其在HPC分析中的应用。

Method: 在Caliper工具中引入“通信区域”这一标注，用于捕获通信数据的度量及其统计信息，以及涉及的MPI进程信息。通过AMG2023、Kripke和Laghos三个代表性应用进行验证。

Conclusion: 引入“通信区域”显著增强了Caliper工具的功能，能够揭示通信瓶颈和详细行为，展示了其在HPC分析中的实用性。

Abstract: We introduce ``communication regions'' into the widely used Caliper HPC
profiling tool. A communication region is an annotation enabling capture of
metrics about the data being communicated (including statistics of these
metrics), and metrics about the MPI processes involved in the communications,
something not previously possible in Caliper. We explore the utility of
communication regions with three representative modeling and simulation
applications, AMG2023, Kripke, and Laghos, all part of the comprehensive
Benchpark suite that includes Caliper annotations. Enhanced Caliper reveals
detailed communication behaviors. Using Caliper and Thicket in tandem, we
create new visualizations of MPI communication patterns, including halo
exchanges. Our findings reveal communication bottlenecks and detailed
behaviors, indicating significant utility of the special-regions addition to
Caliper. The comparative scaling behavior of both CPU and GPU oriented systems
are shown; we are able to look at different regions within a given application,
and see how scalability and message-traffic metrics differ.

Motivation: 边缘存储系统通过将存储和计算靠近终端用户，成为现代云网络中低延迟数据访问的关键推动者。然而，边缘服务器有限的存储容量在处理高容量和延迟敏感的数据访问请求时，尤其是在动态工作负载下，面临重大挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一种利润驱动的框架，整合了协作缓存、擦除编码和弹性存储分区三个关键机制。通过动态分区边缘服务器的存储空间为私有和公共区域，私有区域进一步根据接入点的请求率进行细分，以实现对数据位置和所有权的自适应控制。设计了数据放置和替换策略，以最大化在截止时间内完成的数据访问。

Conclusion: 本文提出的动态空间分区和弹性缓存策略在合成数据和真实世界数据（如Netflix和Spotify的跟踪数据）上进行了评估，结果显示该方法在多样化工作负载条件下，相比现有技术提高了系统整体盈利能力约5%至8%。

Abstract: Edge Storage Systems have emerged as a critical enabler of low latency data
access in modern cloud networks by bringing storage and computation closer to
end users. However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses
significant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data
access requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose
a profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are
collaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike
traditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,
allowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded
blocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and
public regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points
based on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data
locality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that
determines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data
access within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local
APs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring
servers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy
is evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify.
Experimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability
by approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied
workload conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究欺骗性指令如何改变LLMs的内部表示，与真实/中性指令相比，以理解模型何时及如何从真实转向欺骗。

Method: 通过分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct在事实验证任务中的内部表示，使用线性探针和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）来检测欺骗性指令导致的表示变化。

Result: 欺骗性指令在早期到中间层诱导显著的表示变化，且可以通过SAEs检测到特定的敏感特征。

Conclusion: 研究发现揭示了LLMs在欺骗性指令下的特征和层级特征，为检测和缓解LLMs中的欺骗行为提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

Conclusion: 本文提出，系统性不仅仅是AI可解释性的一个方面，而是一个更广泛的概念，需要通过动态理解来调整对AI模型系统性的需求。

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

Result: 在ALFWorld、PDDL和Jericho等复杂任务环境中，CoEx在规划和探索方面表现优于现有代理范式。

Conclusion: CoEx通过分层状态抽象和动态更新的世界模型，显著提升了LLM代理在复杂任务中的规划和探索能力，优于现有代理范式。

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,

from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible

and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent

TL;DR: 提出LLM-Crowdsourced评估范式，解决现有方法在评估LLMs时的局限性，实验验证其优势并揭示新发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好等问题，难以全面评估LLMs的真实能力。

Method: 提出了一种无基准的评估范式LLM-Crowdsourced，利用LLMs生成问题、独立回答并相互评估，整合了动态、透明、客观和专业四项关键评估标准。

Result: 在数学和编程领域的八个主流LLMs上进行的实验验证了该方法的优势，揭示了包括Gemini在问题设计能力上的突出表现、部分LLMs的“基于记忆的回答”行为以及评估结果的高一致性（鲁棒性）等新发现。

Conclusion: LLM-Crowdsourced 提供了一种动态、透明、客观且专业的评估范式，有效解决了现有方法在评估大语言模型（LLMs）能力时的局限性。实验验证了该方法在区分LLM性能方面的优势，并揭示了传统方法难以发现的新发现。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI预测准确性和元认知敏感性如何共同影响人类决策质量。

Method: 引入了一个理论框架来评估AI预测准确性和元认知敏感性在混合决策环境中的联合影响，并进行了行为实验验证。

Result: 研究发现，元认知敏感性更高的AI（即使预测准确性较低）能提升人类决策的整体准确性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在评估AI辅助时不仅要考虑准确性，还要考虑元认知敏感性，并优化两者以实现更优的决策结果。

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

Motivation: 为了构建通用人工智能（AGI），需要一种能够评估智能本质且涵盖多种智能行为范式的通用标准。

Method: 我们提出了一个形式化的框架，将智能定义为在给定类别样本的情况下生成同一类别样本的能力，并通过𝜖-类别智能来衡量。

Result: 提出了𝜖-类别智能的形式化框架，并概述了实证协议。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于样本保真度的通用智能标准，即𝜖-类别智能，并讨论了其在评估、安全性和泛化方面的潜在影响。

Abstract: To engineer AGI, we should first capture the essence of intelligence in a
species-agnostic form that can be evaluated, while being sufficiently general
to encompass diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior, including reinforcement
learning, generative models, classification, analogical reasoning, and
goal-directed decision-making. We propose a general criterion based on sample
fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of

Conclusion: 论文提出了NBN网络作为算法最大概率转移网络的直接理论推导，并开发了一种高效的对数线性时间复杂度的NBN计算方法。通过在OneMax和TSP问题上的应用，揭示了算法在模态和欺骗性方面的挑战，并指出了现有算法的局限性。

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

Method: 我们提出了一个多代理交互智能系统，包括三个专门代理：RecipientAgent、InquirerAgent和DepartmentAgent，通过结构化查询机制和部门特定指导规则，将非结构化患者症状转化为准确的科室推荐。

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

Conclusion: MetaAgent框架通过有限状态机自动生成多智能体系统，其性能超越其他自动设计方法，并与针对特定任务优化的人工设计系统相当。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

TL;DR: LLMs improve SPARQL query generation from natural language in manufacturing KGs when provided with schema context, enhancing accessibility and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between user-friendly natural language interfaces and the complex architecture of KGs, especially in manufacturing.

Method: Evaluated multiple strategies using LLMs as mediators to translate natural language queries into SPARQL, focusing on context-aware prompting techniques.

Result: LLMs perform better in generating correct and complete SPARQL queries when given relevant KG schema context.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly improve query generation accuracy when provided with adequate KG schema context, reducing hallucinations and democratizing access to complex manufacturing data.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

Conclusion: asp-fzn在普通ASP和部分CASP基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越了clingcon。

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

Abstract: Soft everting robots present significant advantages over traditional rigid
robots, including enhanced dexterity, improved environmental interaction, and
safe navigation in unpredictable environments. While soft everting robots have
been widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move
and deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous
work focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation
capabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads
in hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under
debris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this
work, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy
larger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what
objects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through.
Building on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of
payloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict
payload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft
everting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though
a series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and
movement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads
in a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through
circular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry
out discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m
in length.

Abstract: Wheel-legged robots integrate the agility of legs for navigating rough
terrains while harnessing the efficiency of wheels for smooth surfaces.
However, most existing designs do not fully capitalize on the benefits of both
legged and wheeled structures, which limits overall system flexibility and
efficiency. We present FLORES (reconfigured wheel-legged robot for enhanced
steering and adaptability), a novel wheel-legged robot design featuring a
distinctive front-leg configuration that sets it beyond standard design
approaches. Specifically, FLORES replaces the conventional hip-roll degree of
freedom (DoF) of the front leg with hip-yaw DoFs, and this allows for efficient
movement on flat surfaces while ensuring adaptability when navigating complex
terrains. This innovative design facilitates seamless transitions between
different locomotion modes (i.e., legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion) and
optimizes the performance across varied environments. To fully exploit FLORES's
mechanical capabilities, we develop a tailored reinforcement learning (RL)
controller that adapts the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) with a customized reward
structure optimized for our unique mechanical configuration. This framework
enables the generation of adaptive, multi-modal locomotion strategies that
facilitate smooth transitions between wheeled and legged movements.
Furthermore, our distinctive joint design enables the robot to exhibit novel
and highly efficient locomotion gaits that capitalize on the synergistic
advantages of both locomotion modes. Through comprehensive experiments, we
demonstrate FLORES's enhanced steering capabilities, improved navigation
efficiency, and versatile locomotion across various terrains. The open-source

Abstract: Existing earthmoving autonomy is largely confined to highly controlled and
well-characterized environments due to the complexity of vehicle-terrain
interaction dynamics and the partial observability of the terrain resulting
from unknown and spatially varying soil conditions. In this chapter, a a
soil-property mapping system is proposed to extend the environmental state, in
order to overcome these restrictions and facilitate development of more robust
autonomous earthmoving. A GPU accelerated elevation mapping system is extended
to incorporate a blind mapping component which traces the movement of the blade
through the terrain to displace and erode intersected soil, enabling separately
tracking undisturbed and disturbed soil. Each interaction is approximated as a
flat blade moving through a locally homogeneous soil, enabling modeling of
cutting forces using the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE). Building
upon our prior work on in situ soil-property estimation, a method is devised to
extract approximate geometric parameters of the model given the uneven terrain,
and an improved physics infused neural network (PINN) model is developed to
predict soil properties and uncertainties of these estimates. A simulation of a
compact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to
train the PINN model. Post-training, the model is leveraged online by the
mapping system to track soil property estimates spatially as separate layers in
the map, with updates being performed in a Bayesian manner. Initial experiments
show that the system accurately highlights regions requiring higher relative
interaction forces, indicating the promise of this approach in enabling
soil-aware planning for autonomous terrain shaping.

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于多模态轨迹预测的安全监控方法，通过凸优化和共形预测确保安全监控的完整性和可靠性，实验证明其在保持完整性的同时显著提高了可靠性。

Abstract: The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable
intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the
final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of
the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to
detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we
propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal
trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of
surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract
these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions,
conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure
completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and
guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To
preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor
failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS
conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess
the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with
these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible
future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show
our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness,
offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统（ADS）的安全验证需要准确估计场景参数的PDF，但传统方法存在参数独立性假设或维度灾难问题。归一化流（NF）因其灵活性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 本文提出使用归一化流（NF）来估计参数的概率密度函数（PDF），并与传统方法核密度估计（KDE）进行比较。NF通过一系列可逆和可微分映射将简单基分布转换为复杂分布，支持灵活的高维密度估计。

Conclusion: 本工作展示了归一化流（NF）在基于场景的安全评估中的潜力，并提出了未来研究方向，包括优化NF架构和训练超参数以增强其适用性。

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

Conclusion: 该框架通过两阶段轻量级设计，显著减少了网络参数和能耗，实现了实时导航，并支持从仿真到现实的零样本迁移。

Abstract: Land-air bimodal robots (LABR) are gaining attention for autonomous
navigation, combining high mobility from aerial vehicles with long endurance
from ground vehicles. However, existing LABR navigation methods are limited by
suboptimal trajectories from mapping-based approaches and the excessive
computational demands of learning-based methods. To address this, we propose a
two-stage lightweight framework that integrates global key points prediction
with local trajectory refinement to generate efficient and reachable
trajectories. In the first stage, the Global Key points Prediction Network
(GKPN) was used to generate a hybrid land-air keypoint path. The GKPN includes
a Sobel Perception Network (SPN) for improved obstacle detection and a
Lightweight Attention Planning Network (LAPN) to improves predictive ability by
capturing contextual information. In the second stage, the global path is
segmented based on predicted key points and refined using a mapping-based
planner to create smooth, collision-free trajectories. Experiments conducted on
our LABR platform show that our framework reduces network parameters by 14\%
and energy consumption during land-air transitions by 35\% compared to existing
approaches. The framework achieves real-time navigation without GPU
acceleration and enables zero-shot transfer from simulation to reality during

Abstract: Sewer pipe faults, such as leaks and blockages, can lead to severe
consequences including groundwater contamination, property damage, and service
disruption. Traditional inspection methods rely heavily on the manual review of
CCTV footage collected by mobile robots, which is inefficient and susceptible
to human error. To automate this process, we propose a novel system
incorporating explainable deep learning anomaly detection combined with
sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT). The anomaly detector processes
single image frames, providing interpretable spatial localisation of anomalies,
whilst the SPRT introduces temporal evidence aggregation, enhancing robustness
against noise over sequences of image frames. Experimental results demonstrate
improved anomaly detection performance, highlighting the benefits of the
combined spatiotemporal analysis system for reliable and robust sewer
inspection.

Abstract: Developing controllers that generalize across diverse robot morphologies
remains a significant challenge in legged locomotion. Traditional approaches
either create specialized controllers for each morphology or compromise
performance for generality. This paper introduces a two-stage teacher-student
framework that bridges this gap through policy distillation. First, we train
specialized teacher policies optimized for individual morphologies, capturing
the unique optimal control strategies for each robot design. Then, we distill
this specialized expertise into a single Transformer-based student policy
capable of controlling robots with varying leg configurations. Our experiments
across five distinct legged morphologies demonstrate that our approach
preserves morphology-specific optimal behaviors, with the Transformer
architecture achieving 94.47\% of teacher performance on training morphologies
and 72.64\% on unseen robot designs. Comparative analysis reveals that
Transformer-based architectures consistently outperform MLP baselines by
leveraging attention mechanisms to effectively model joint relationships across
different kinematic structures. We validate our approach through successful
deployment on a physical quadruped robot, demonstrating the practical viability
of our morphology-agnostic control framework. This work presents a scalable
solution for developing universal legged robot controllers that maintain
near-optimal performance while generalizing across diverse morphologies.

Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&V) of Autonomous Driving Functions
(ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous

sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a

scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces
a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of
critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an
Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it
identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of
magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE)
methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework
in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple,
distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case

Result: 实验表明RedCoder在多轮对话中诱导代码漏洞的效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RedCoder为评估代码生成系统安全性提供了可扩展且有效的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation (i.e., Code LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in AI-assisted software development and
testing. However, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to
generating vulnerable or even malicious code under adversarial settings.
Existing red-teaming approaches rely on extensive human effort, limiting their
scalability and practicality, and generally overlook the interactive nature of
real-world AI-assisted programming, which often unfolds over multiple turns. To
bridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim
models in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to
construct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates
adversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an
arsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these
prototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed,
RedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations,
dynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the
dialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple
Code LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn
red-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a
scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern
code-generation systems.

Motivation: 模糊测试中的随机性虽然有助于发现漏洞，但也显著降低了效率。定向模糊测试虽通过引导测试目标减少了随机性，但种子和变异器的随机性仍是一个挑战。

Method: RandLuzz利用LLMs的强大推理和代码生成能力，生成可到达的种子和针对特定漏洞的变异器。通过分析函数调用链或功能来指导LLMs生成种子，并使用LLMs进行漏洞分析以构建漏洞特定的变异器。

Result: RandLuzz在评估中表现优异，与四种最先进的定向模糊测试工具相比，使用RandLuzz生成的种子平均提速2.1至4.8倍，并在特定漏洞上实现了最高2.7倍的提速，甚至在60秒内暴露了8个漏洞。

Conclusion: RandLuzz通过整合大型语言模型（LLMs）和定向模糊测试，显著提高了种子和变异器的质量，从而实现了更高效的漏洞暴露。

Abstract: Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of
randomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of
fuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed
fuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,
the dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical
components, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely
tied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the
challenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to
remove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With
their strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to
generate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct
bug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which
integrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and
mutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call
chain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To
construct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,
obtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which
further help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate
RandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,
Beacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers
achieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\times$ to 4.8$\times$ compared to
using widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual
bugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\times$ speedup compared to the
second-fastest exposure. On 8 bugs, RandLuzz can even expose them within 60
seconds.

Abstract: Large-scale enterprise systems utilizing Protocol Buffers (protobuf) present
significant challenges for performance testing, particularly when targeting
intermediate business interfaces with complex nested data structures.
Traditional test data generation approaches are inadequate for handling the
intricate hierarchical and graph-like structures inherent in enterprise

that leverages Python's metaclass system for dynamic type enhancement and
statistical analysis of production logs for realistic value domain extraction.
Our approach combines automatic schema introspection, statistical value
distribution analysis, and recursive descent algorithms for handling deeply
nested structures. Experimental evaluation on three real-world enterprise
systems demonstrates up to 95\% reduction in test data preparation time and
80\% improvement in test coverage compared to existing approaches. The
framework successfully handles protobuf structures with up to 15 levels of
nesting and generates comprehensive test suites containing over 100,000 test
cases within seconds.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了Git中diff和merge算法的多个意外行为，包括病理案例、时间复杂度问题以及非确定性结果，强调了这些算法在复杂场景下的不可预测性。

Abstract: Despite being widely used, the algorithms that enable collaboration with Git
are not well understood. The diff and merge algorithms are particularly
interesting, as they could be applied in other contexts. In this thesis, I
document the main functionalities of Git: how diffs are computed, how they are
used to run merges, and how merges enable more complex operations. In the
process, I show multiple unexpected behaviors in Git, including the following:
The histogram diff algorithm has pathological cases where a single-line change
can cause the entire rest of the file to be marked as changed. The default
merge strategy (ort) can result in merges requiring exponential time in the
number of commits in the history. Merges and rebases are not commutative, and
even when merges do not result in a conflict, the result is not specified but
depends on the diff algorithm used. And finally, sometimes when two sides of a
merge add different lines at the same position, the result is not a conflict,
but a merge containing both changes after each other, in arbitrary order.

TL;DR: CodeEvo框架通过LLM代理交互和混合反馈机制合成高质量代码数据，显著提升代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动获取高质量的指令-代码对成本高且规模有限，现有方法缺乏严格的数据验证，导致合成数据质量低下。

Method: 提出了CodeEvo框架，通过Coder生成候选代码和测试用例，Reviewer生成新指令和反馈，结合编译器确定性和代理生成灵活性的混合反馈机制，实现自动质量控制。

Result: 实验表明，基于CodeEvo数据微调的模型在多种难度的代码生成基准测试中显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CodeEvo框架通过两个LLM代理的迭代交互（Coder和Reviewer）以及混合反馈机制，显著提升了代码生成模型的性能，为代码中心数据合成提供了有效的方法和深入见解。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive
and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric
synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing
code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation,
which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly
simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose
CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions
between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases
based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process
by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid
feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative
flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data
significantly outperform established baselines across code generation
benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide
insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

*Vaani Goenka,Aalok D. Thakkar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BOOP是一个结构化编程框架，通过强制形式化规范和证明阶段，改善学生编程习惯，减少试错，增强问题理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新手程序员依赖语法和测试用例驱动的编程方式，以及AI编码工具提供的语法正确但概念错误的解决方案问题。

Method: BOOP框架包括四个强制阶段：形式化规范、语言无关算法开发、实现和正确性证明。通过VS Code扩展和预处理器实施约束并识别反模式。

Result: 初步评估显示，BOOP提高了算法推理能力，减少了试错调试。学生报告了对边缘案例的更好理解和问题分解能力。教师观察到学生的基础技能比传统方法更强。

Conclusion: BOOP框架通过强制四个阶段（形式化规范、语言无关算法开发、实现和正确性证明），有效改善了学生的算法推理能力，减少了试错调试，并增强了他们对边缘案例的理解和问题分解能力。

Abstract: Novice programmers frequently adopt a syntax-specific and test-case-driven
approach, writing code first and adjusting until programs compile and test
cases pass, rather than developing correct solutions through systematic
reasoning. AI coding tools exacerbate this challenge by providing syntactically
correct but conceptually flawed solutions. In this paper, we introduce BOOP
(Blueprint, Operations, OCaml, Proof), a structured framework requiring four
mandatory phases: formal specification, language-agnostic algorithm
development, implementation, and correctness proof. This shifts focus from
``making code work'' to understanding why code is correct.
  BOOP was implemented at our institution using a VS Code extension and
preprocessor that enforces constraints and identifies counterproductive
patterns. Initial evaluation shows improved algorithmic reasoning and reduced
trial-and-error debugging. Students reported better edge case understanding and
problem decomposition, though some initially found the format verbose.
Instructors observed stronger foundational skills compared to traditional
approaches.

TL;DR: TypyBench基准评估大型语言模型在Python代码库中的类型推断能力，发现模型在复杂类型和一致性上表现不佳，为未来研究提供了新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态语言（如Python）的类型推断是软件工程中的长期挑战，大型语言模型在此领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究团队引入了TypyBench基准，包含TypeSim和TypeCheck两个新指标，评估了多种大型语言模型在50个高质量Python代码库上的类型推断表现。

Result: 大型语言模型在TypeSim上表现尚可，但在复杂嵌套类型和代码库级别的类型一致性上存在显著问题。

Conclusion: TypyBench为评估大型语言模型在Python代码库中的类型推断能力提供了一个新的基准，揭示了模型在复杂嵌套类型和类型一致性方面的不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Type inference for dynamic languages like Python is a persistent challenge in
software engineering. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
code understanding, their type inference capabilities remain underexplored. We
introduce TypyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' type inference
across entire Python repositories. TypyBench features two novel metrics:
TypeSim, which captures nuanced semantic relationships between predicted and
ground truth types, and TypeCheck, which assesses type consistency across
codebases. Our evaluation of various LLMs on a curated dataset of 50
high-quality Python repositories reveals that, although LLMs achieve decent
TypeSim scores, they struggle with complex nested types and exhibit significant
type consistency errors. These findings suggest that future research should
shift focus from improving type similarity to addressing repository-level
consistency. TypyBench provides a foundation for this new direction, offering
insights into model performance across different type complexities and usage
contexts. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs可通过科学出版物中的方法描述生成代码，性能媲美传统库，预示未来可能减少对人工维护软件包的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件包的维护成本高，依赖管理、错误修复和版本控制带来显著负担。

Method: 通过让最先进的模型（GPT-o4-mini-high、Gemini Pro 2.5、Claude Sonnet 4）实现从原始出版物中提取的多样化核心算法进行基准测试。

Result: LLMs能够基于科学出版物中的详细方法描述生成代码，性能与传统库相当。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型（LLMs）能够可靠地复现软件包功能，其性能与传统库无异，预示着向灵活、按需代码生成的范式转变，减少维护开销。

Abstract: Maintaining software packages imposes significant costs due to dependency
management, bug fixes, and versioning. We show that rich method descriptions in
scientific publications can serve as standalone specifications for modern large
language models (LLMs), enabling on-demand code generation that could supplant
human-maintained libraries. We benchmark state-of-the-art models
(GPT-o4-mini-high, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4) by tasking them with
implementing a diverse set of core algorithms drawn from original publications.
Our results demonstrate that current LLMs can reliably reproduce package
functionality with performance indistinguishable from conventional libraries.
These findings foreshadow a paradigm shift toward flexible, on-demand code
generation and away from static, human-maintained packages, which will result
in reduced maintenance overhead by leveraging published articles as sufficient
context for the automated implementation of analytical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有LLM代理（如AutoCodeRover）能够自动修复静态分析问题，但在生产环境中部署时，代理需要提供高置信度的软件工件（如补丁）及其证据。

Method: 采用基于属性的测试（PBT）和程序内部符号表达式生成输入条件、感染条件和输出条件，作为错误解释的形式。

Result: 提出的工作流程不仅支持人类开发者通过可执行的PBT生成具体输入以验证问题，还能在完全自动化的环境中用于接受或拒绝补丁。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种通过符号公式（如基于属性的测试和程序内部符号表达式）为LLM代理提供错误解释的工作流程，旨在提高代理输出的人类开发者认知度并实现完全自动化的代理工作流。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents autonomously use external tools on top of
one or more LLMs to accomplish specific tasks. Lately LLM agents for software
engineering tasks have become popular. These agents can benefit from the use of
program analysis tools working on program representations. This is demonstrated
by existing agentic AI solutions such as AutoCodeRover or SpecRover which
perform automated program repair. Specifically the goal of these works is to
use program analysis to improve the patch quality. These agents are currently
being used to automatically fix static analysis issues from the widely used
SonarQube static analyzer.
  Nevertheless, for the agents to be deployed in a production environment,
agents need to suggest software artifacts, such as patches, with evidence and
with high confidence. In this work, we provide a workflow where an agent
provides explanations of the bug in the form of symbolic formulae. The
explanations are in the form of input conditions, infection conditions and
output conditions, implemented as property based tests (PBT) and
program-internal symbolic expressions. These can help in human developer
cognition of the agent outputs as well as in achieving completely automated
agentic workflows for software. The human developer can benefit from the input
condition, represented as a PBT, to generate various concrete inputs showing a
given issue. Furthermore, since the PBTs are executable, our explanations are
executable as well. We can thus also use the explanations in a completely
automated issue resolution environment for accepting or rejecting the patches
that are suggested by patching agents such as AutoCodeRover. Finally, as
agentic AI approaches continue to develop, the program analysis driven
explanations can be provided to other LLM-based repair techniques such as
Agentless to improve their output.

Abstract: Fuzzing is widely used for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities, with various
techniques proposed to enhance its effectiveness. To combine the advantages of
multiple technologies, researchers proposed ensemble fuzzing, which integrates
multiple base fuzzers. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art ensemble
fuzzing techniques face limitations in resource scheduling and performance
evaluation, leading to unnecessary resource waste. In this paper, we propose
Legion, a novel ensemble fuzzing framework that dynamically schedules resources
during the ensemble fuzzing campaign. We designed a novel resource scheduling
algorithm based on the upper confidence bound algorithm to reduce the resource
consumption of ineffective base fuzzers. Additionally, we introduce a
multidimensional seed evaluation strategy, which considers multiple metrics to
achieve more comprehensive fine-grained performance evaluation. We implemented
Legion as a prototype tool and evaluated its effectiveness on Google's
fuzzer-test-suite as well as real-world open-source projects. Results show that
Legion outperforms existing state-of-the-art base fuzzers and ensemble fuzzing
techniques, detecting 20 vulnerabilities in real-world open-source
projects-five previously unknown and three classified as CVEs.

Motivation: 为了解决大规模折扣无限水平马尔可夫决策过程的高效求解问题，尤其是在内存受限或接近无折扣设置的情况下。

Method: Madupite依赖一类数学优化方法，支持完全分布式工作，利用现代高性能计算集群的内存存储和计算能力。

Result: Madupite能够高效计算大规模马尔可夫决策过程的精确解，即使问题超出笔记本电脑的内存容量。

Conclusion: Madupite代表了解决大规模马尔可夫决策过程的重大进展，提供了无与伦比的可扩展性和灵活性。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and benchmark madupite, a newly proposed
high-performance solver designed for large-scale discounted infinite-horizon
Markov decision processes with finite state and action spaces. After a brief
overview of the class of mathematical optimization methods on which madupite
relies, we provide details on implementation choices, technical design and
deployment. We then demonstrate its scalability and efficiency by showcasing
its performance on the solution of Markov decision processes arising from
different application areas, including epidemiology and classical control.
Madupite sets a new standard as, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only
solver capable of efficiently computing exact solutions for large-scale Markov
decision processes, even when these exceed the memory capacity of modern
laptops and operate in near-undiscounted settings. This is possible as madupite
can work in a fully distributed manner and therefore leverage the memory
storage and computation capabilities of modern high-performance computing
clusters. This key feature enables the solver to efficiently handle problems of
medium to large size in an exact manner instead of necessarily resorting to
function approximations. Moreover, madupite is unique in allowing users to
customize the solution algorithm to better exploit the specific structure of
their problem, significantly accelerating convergence especially in
large-discount factor settings. Overall, madupite represents a significant
advancement, offering unmatched scalability and flexibility in solving
large-scale Markov decision processes.

Motivation: 现有的自动程序修复（APR）工具生成的补丁可能仅满足测试用例而未真正修复底层错误（即过拟合补丁），而当前的静态APCA技术在可靠性、灵活性和透明度方面存在不足。

Method: 引入RePaCA技术，利用专用于思考任务的大型语言模型（LLMs），通过分析代码差异、推理补丁如何解决根本问题，并进行二元分类（正确或过拟合）。模型通过强化学习和组相对策略优化算法进行微调。

Result: 在标准Defects4J测试中，RePaCA达到了83.1%的准确率和84.8%的F1分数，表现出卓越的泛化能力和解释性，优于现有领先技术。

Conclusion: 该研究通过微调专用的大型语言模型（LLMs），显著提升了静态自动补丁正确性评估（APCA）的准确性、泛化能力和可解释性，展示了LLMs在该领域的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) seeks to automatically correct software bugs
without requiring human intervention. However, existing tools tend to generate
patches that satisfy test cases without fixing the underlying bug, those are
known as overfitting patches. To address this issue, Automated Patch
Correctness Assessment (APCA) attempts to identify overfitting patches
generated by APR tools. It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that no
additional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets.
Current static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility and
transparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCA
technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinking
tasks. Our model is prompted with both buggy and fixed code snippets and guided
to generate a Chain of Thought that analyses code differences, reasons about
how the patch addresses the root cause, and ultimately provides a binary
classification: correct or overfitting. To enhance these reasoning capabilities
for the APCA task specifically, the LLM is finetuned using Reinforcement
Learning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm. When evaluated
on a standard Defects4J-derived test, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 83.1% accuracy and an 84.8% F1-score. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates superior generalization capabilities when trained on different
datasets, outperforming the leading technique. This reasoning capability also
provides enhanced explainability for the patch assessment. These findings
underscore the considerable promise of finetuned, reasoning LLMs to advance
static APCA by enhancing accuracy, generalization, and explainability.

Abstract: Large language models and deep learning models designed for code intelligence
have revolutionized the software engineering field due to their ability to
perform various code-related tasks. These models can process source code and
software artifacts with high accuracy in tasks such as code completion, defect
detection, and code summarization; therefore, they can potentially become an
integral part of modern software engineering practices. Despite these
capabilities, robustness remains a critical quality attribute for deep-code
models as they may produce different results under varied and adversarial
conditions (e.g., variable renaming). Metamorphic testing has become a widely
used approach to evaluate models' robustness by applying semantic-preserving
transformations to input programs and analyzing the stability of model outputs.
While prior research has explored testing deep learning models, this systematic
literature review focuses specifically on metamorphic testing for deep code
models. By studying 45 primary papers, we analyze the transformations,
techniques, and evaluation methods used to assess robustness. Our review
summarizes the current landscape, identifying frequently evaluated models,
programming tasks, datasets, target languages, and evaluation metrics, and
highlights key challenges and future directions for advancing the field.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software
engineering has sparked interest in their use for software vulnerability
detection. However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a
fragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to
compare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This
fragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the
state-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work,
we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between
January 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input
representation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we
analyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability
coverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability
detection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future
research opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this
review improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers
and practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research.
We publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection studies.

Conclusion: RobEthiChor 是一种有效的方法，使自主系统能够通过基于伦理的谈判将用户的伦理偏好和上下文因素纳入决策过程，实验证明了其可行性和有效性。

Abstract: The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is
impacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently,
these systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.
However, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which
are unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the
decision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous
systems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When
multiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must
negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the
parties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous
systems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into
their decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a
domain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable
of ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an
implementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which
can be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation
capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real
robots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource
contention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
of the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots
to reach an agreement in more than 73\% of the scenarios with an acceptable
negotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the
negotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务的高度解耦和灵活性增加了系统可靠性挑战，需要快速根因分析（RCA）方法。现有LLM框架因幻觉和异常传播导致定位错误，且处理大规模异常信息时面临上下文窗口长度限制。

Method: 提出KnowledgeMind，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和知识库奖励机制，实现标准化逐服务推理，减少上下文窗口负担并抑制幻觉。

Result: 相比现有SOTA方法，上下文窗口需求减少90%，根因定位准确率提升49.29%至128.35%。

Conclusion: KnowledgeMind通过创新多智能体设计和奖励机制，有效解决了LLM在RCA中的幻觉和上下文限制问题，显著提升了定位性能。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, due to the highly decoupled and flexible nature of
microservices, it poses greater challenges to system reliability. The more
frequent occurrence of incidents has created a demand for Root Cause
Analysis(RCA) methods that enable rapid identification and recovery of
incidents. Large language model (LLM) provides a new path for quickly locating
and recovering from incidents by leveraging their powerful generalization
ability combined with expert experience. Current LLM for RCA frameworks are
based on ideas like ReAct and Chain-of-Thought, but the hallucination of LLM
and the propagation nature of anomalies often lead to incorrect localization
results. Moreover, the massive amount of anomalous information generated in
large, complex systems presents a huge challenge for the context window length
of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose KnowledgeMind, an innovative
LLM multi-agent system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and a knowledge base
reward mechanism for standardized service-by-service reasoning. Compared to
State-Of-The-Art(SOTA) LLM for RCA methods, our service-by-service exploration
approach significantly reduces the burden on the maximum context window length,
requiring only one-tenth of its size. Additionally, by incorporating a
rule-based real-time reward mechanism, our method effectively mitigates
hallucinations during the inference process. Compared to the SOTA LLM for RCA
framework, our method achieves a 49.29% to 128.35% improvement in root cause
localization accuracy.

code-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current
LLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference
stage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates
it through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two
important aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training
phase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address
this, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's
training phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is
required to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish
defective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables
the model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of
defects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with
three different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to
co-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely
adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,
compared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\% to
48.29\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\% to 53.28\%, and test coverage
by 0.78\% to 53.96\%. We publish the code and weights at

### [126] [Tracking research software outputs in the UK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22871)
*Domhnall Carlin,Austen Rainer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了英国公开资助的研究软件的存储和注册情况，发现共享比例低且链接问题多，影响软件的长期价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究软件在科研过程中至关重要，但如何将其作为研究产出进行识别和共享仍不明确，本研究旨在探讨这一问题。

Method: 通过分析英国研究创新署（UKRI）的Gateway to Research（GtR）元数据，研究公开资助的研究软件在英国的存储和注册情况。

Result: 研究发现，软件作为研究产出的报告比例较低，45%的软件链接缺失或错误，GitHub是最大的公共代码托管平台（占18%）。

Conclusion: 研究发现，英国学术界在研究报告中对软件的共享和注册比例较低，且存在大量无效或缺失的URL链接，这影响了研究软件的长期维护和科学价值。

Abstract: Research software is crucial in the research process and the growth of Open
Science underscores the importance of accessing research artifacts, like data
and code, raising traceability challenges among outputs. While it is a clear
principle that research code, along with other essential outputs, should be
recognised as artifacts of the research process, the how of this principle
remains variable. This study examines where UK academic institutions store and
register software as a unique research output, searching the UKRI's Gateway to
Research (GtR) metadata for publicly funded research software in the UK. The
quantity of software reported as research outcomes remains low in proportion to
other categories. Artifact sharing appears low, with one-quarter of the
reported software having no links and 45% having either a missing or erroneous
URL. Of the valid URLs, we find the single largest category is Public
Commercial Code Repository, with GitHub being the host of 18% of all publicly
funded research software listed. These observations are contrasted with past
findings from 2023 and finally, we discuss the lack of artifact sharing in UK
research, with resulting implications for the maintenance and evolution of
research software. Without dissemination, research software risks demotion to a
transient artifact, useful only to meet short term research demands but
ultimately lost to the broader enterprise of science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFC资源分配算法评估工具存在准确性低、扩展性差等问题，因此需要一个新的仿真工具来支持动态网络条件下的算法研究。

Method: 论文提出了一个基于Mininet和Docker的仿真器OpenRASE，用于动态测试SFC资源分配算法，并实验评估了包括在线遗传算法在内的两种算法。

Conclusion: OpenRASE是一个基于Mininet和Docker的SFC仿真器，能够有效支持动态网络条件下的资源分配算法研究，展现其实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) are one of the key enablers in providing
programmable computer networks, paving the way for network autonomy. However,
this also introduces new challenges, such as resource allocation and
optimisation related to their operation, requiring new algorithms to address
these challenges. Various tools have been used in the literature to evaluate
these algorithms. However, these tools suffer from inaccuracy, low fidelity,
unscalability, inflexibility, or additional code requirements. This paper
introduces an emulator based on Mininet and Docker for SFCs called OpenRASE.
The goal of OpenRASE is to enable the exploration of resource allocation
algorithms for SFCs in a dynamic setting, allowing real CPU usage and latency
to be measured. We describe the design and implementation of OpenRASE and
discuss its characteristics. We also experimentally evaluate two different
algorithms to address the SFC resource allocation challenge, including an
online Genetic Algorithm, using OpenRASE to show its effectiveness and
practicality for dynamic network conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合SCA和PSO的混合元启发式定位算法，通过自适应切换和优化设计，显著降低了定位误差和迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网（IoT）中传感器节点的精确定位是实际应用的基础需求，而现有方法在多样环境中的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 算法整合了Sine Cosine Algorithm（SCA）和Particle Swarm Optimization（PSO），并设计了自适应切换模块动态选择两者。初始化、适应度评估和参数设置也针对节点定位问题进行了优化。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比单独的PSO和未优化的SCAPSO算法，该方法显著减少了迭代次数，并将平均定位误差降低了84.97%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的混合元启发式定位算法通过结合SCA和PSO的优势，并引入自适应切换模块，显著提升了传感器节点定位的准确性和效率，适用于多样化的物联网环境。

Abstract: The accurate localization of sensor nodes is a fundamental requirement for
the practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT). To enable robust
localization across diverse environments, this paper proposes a hybrid
meta-heuristic localization algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm integrates
the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), which is effective in global search, with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which excels at local search. An adaptive
switching module is introduced to dynamically select between the two
algorithms. Furthermore, the initialization, fitness evaluation, and parameter
settings of the algorithm have been specifically redesigned and optimized to
address the characteristics of the node localization problem. Simulation
results across varying numbers of sensor nodes demonstrate that, compared to
standalone PSO and the unoptimized SCAPSO algorithm, the proposed method
significantly reduces the number of required iterations and achieves an average
localization error reduction of 84.97%.

infrastructure and extending the capabilities of low-cost, non-intrusive
environmental monitoring.

Motivation: 现代网络环境缺乏对物理空间的协调表示，导致空间访问策略等任务脆弱且手动化。

Method: 1. 提出基于bigraphs的统一表示法，捕获空间、社交和通信关系；2. 设计分层代理架构，包含运行时环境和上下文感知执行模型。

Result: 实现了能够安全交互且低延迟的空间网络。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于bigraphs的统一表示法和分层代理架构，实现了私有、可靠且低延迟的空间网络，能够安全地与代理工作流交互。

Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but
lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently,
tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We
first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial,
social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with
user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we
present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning,
with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and
a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable
subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial
networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of network infrastructure is bringing new challenges and
opportunities for efficient network management, optimization, and security.
With very large monitoring databases becoming expensive to explore, the use of
AI and Generative AI can help reduce costs of managing these datasets. This
paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize network
monitoring management by addressing the limitations of query finding and
pattern analysis. We leverage LLMs to enhance anomaly detection, automate
root-cause analysis, and automate incident analysis to build a well-monitored
network management team using AI. Through a real-world example of developing
our own OFCNetLLM, based on the open-source LLM model, we demonstrate practical
applications of OFCnetLLM in the OFC conference network. Our model is developed
as a multi-agent approach and is still evolving, and we present early results
here.

*Yidong Ren,Maolin Gan,Chenning Li,Shakhrul Iman Siam,Mi Zhang,Shigang Chen,Zhichao Cao*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Morph通过SF配置编码和DNN解码协同设计，在极低SNR下提升LoRa通信可靠性和效率，实测性能优于标准方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRa编码器在极低SNR环境下通信可靠性和计算效率不足，尤其是在商用节点上SF-12的SNR容限有限，亟需改进。

Method: 开发了基于SF配置的编码器模拟超过SF-12的更大SF，并利用深度神经网络（DNN）解码器捕获多维特征以最大化SNR增益，同时定制了DNN的输入大小、网络结构和训练方法。

Result: 实验表明，Morph在-28.8dB SNR下可靠解码数据，比标准LoRa（SF-12）低6.4dB，且DNN解码器计算效率提升约3倍。

Conclusion: Morph通过创新的编码解码协同设计，显著提升了在极低信噪比（SNR）下的通信可靠性和计算效率，兼容现有商用LoRa节点，展现了实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Morph, a LoRa encoder-decoder co-design to enhance
communication reliability while improving its computation efficiency in
extremely-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. The standard LoRa encoder
controls 6 Spreading Factors (SFs) to tradeoff SNR tolerance with data rate.
SF-12 is the maximum SF providing the lowest SNR tolerance on commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes. In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based
encoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS
LoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph
symbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF
configuration of the symbol for data decoding. We leverage a Deep Neural
Network (DNN) decoder to fully capture multi-dimensional features among diverse
SF configurations to maximize the SNR gain. Moreover, we customize the input
size, neural network structure, and training method of the DNN decoder to
improve its efficiency, reliability, and generalizability. We implement Morph
with COTS LoRa nodes and a USRP N210, then evaluate its performance on indoor
and campus-scale testbeds. Results show that we can reliably decode data at
-28.8~dB SNR, which is 6.4~dB lower than the standard LoRa with SF-12 chirps.
In addition, the computation efficiency of our DNN decoder is about 3x higher
than state-of-the-art.
