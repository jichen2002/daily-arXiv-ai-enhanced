### [1] [CHECK-MAT: Checking Hand-Written Mathematical Answers for the Russian Unified State Exam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22958)
*Ruslan Khrulev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出EGE-Math评估基准，测试视觉语言模型对手写数学解题的评分能力，发现现有模型在数学推理和评分标准对齐方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注问题解决能力，而本研究旨在评估视觉语言模型在理解学生解题过程、识别错误并按固定标准评分的能力。

Method: 论文收集了122份来自俄罗斯统一国家考试（EGE）的手写数学解题扫描件及官方专家评分，评估了来自Google、OpenAI、Arcee AI和阿里云的七种现代视觉语言模型在三种推理模式下的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，当前视觉语言模型在数学推理和与人类评分标准对齐方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入EGE-Math Solutions Assessment Benchmark，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在数学推理和评分标准对齐方面的局限性，为AI辅助评估开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to
assess hand-written mathematical solutions. Unlike existing benchmarks that
focus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student
solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视图捕获中外观变化对重建鲁棒性的影响，同时实现城市规模场景的快速重建和实时渲染。

Method: 采用场景分区并行训练，结合基于可见性的图像选择策略优化训练效率，并利用可控的细节层次（LOD）策略及外观变换模块处理图像间外观不一致问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效重建城市规模场景，并在效率和质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架在保持高效训练和渲染的同时，成功重建了城市规模的场景，并在效率和质量上优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [3] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScanDiff结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，生成多样且真实的扫描路径，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成的扫描路径多为平均行为，无法捕捉人类视觉探索的变异性，因此需要一种能生成多样化扫描路径的新方法。

Method: 结合扩散模型与Vision Transformers，利用扩散模型的随机性生成多样的扫描路径，并引入文本条件以实现任务驱动的扫描路径生成。

Result: ScanDiff在基准数据集上优于现有方法，生成的扫描路径更多样且准确。

Conclusion: ScanDiff通过结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，成功生成了多样且真实的扫描路径，超越了现有方法，并在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均表现出色。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高医学图像中解剖位置匹配的鲁棒性和准确性，尤其是在纵向内部和公共数据集上的表现。

Method: 将一致性启发式算法融入点匹配算法中，以提高医学图像中解剖位置匹配的鲁棒性。

Result: 在Deep Lesion Tracking数据集上超越了现有技术成果，并有效解决了地标定位问题。

in matching anatomical locations across pairs of medical images. We validated
our approach on diverse longitudinal internal and public datasets spanning CT
and MRI modalities. Notably, it surpasses state-of-the-art results on the Deep
Lesion Tracking dataset. Additionally, we show that the method effectively
addresses landmark localization. The algorithm operates efficiently on standard
CPU hardware and allows configurable trade-offs between speed and robustness.
The method enables high-precision navigation between medical images without
requiring a machine learning model or training data.

### [5] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了深度学习超分辨率技术在提升低质量超声心动图分类准确性上的潜力，发现SRResNet能显著恢复诊断价值，适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限环境下，超声心动图图像质量差限制了诊断模型的效力。尽管超分辨率技术在MRI和CT扫描中表现良好，但在超声心动图中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用公开可用的CAMUS数据集，按图像质量分层样本，评估两种临床相关任务：简单的两腔与四腔视图分类和复杂的舒张末期与收缩末期相位分类。应用SRGAN和SRResNet两种超分辨率模型增强低质量图像。

Result: SRResNet在性能指标上表现显著提升，尤其在计算效率上更具优势。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术（特别是SRResNet）能有效恢复低质量超声心动图的诊断价值，为资源受限环境下的AI辅助医疗提供了可行工具。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [6] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PATA是一种基于SNN的动态时间步长NeRF框架，通过自适应调整时间步长，在保持渲染质量的同时显著降低计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NeRF模型在训练和推理过程中因密集点采样导致的计算资源消耗大、难以在资源受限场景（如边缘计算）中应用的问题。

Method: 基于Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)和Instant-NGP架构，提出了一种动态时间步长训练策略（PATA），自动探索渲染质量与时间步长之间的权衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，PATA在多样化数据集上能保持渲染质量，同时减少64%的推理时间步长和61.55%的运行功耗。

Conclusion: PATA框架通过动态时间步长调整策略，在保持渲染质量的同时显著减少了推理时间步长和运行功耗，为资源受限场景下的3D重建和渲染任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [7] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种单分支视觉-语言架构，通过多模态数据融合和轻量级交叉注意力块提升自动驾驶性能，成功率和路径效率显著提高，同时减少碰撞和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需在毫秒内响应复杂路况和交通意图，传统方法可能无法满足实时性和准确性需求。NovaDrive旨在通过单分支架构和多模态数据融合提升性能。

Method: NovaDrive采用单分支视觉-语言架构，结合前摄像头图像、高清地图、LiDAR深度和文本航点，通过轻量级两阶段交叉注意力块对齐航点与地图，并细化对图像和深度斑块的注意力。配合新颖的平滑损失函数减少突然转向和速度变化，无需循环记忆。基于11B LLaMA-3.2视觉-语言骨干网络微调顶层15层，实现实时推理。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo子集的MD-NEX Outdoor基准测试中，NovaDrive将成功率提升至84%（+4%），路径效率（SPL）提升至0.66（+0.11），碰撞频率从2.6%降至1.2%（-1.4%）。航点标记、部分VLM微调和交叉注意力融合对性能提升贡献最大。

Conclusion: NovaDrive的架构设计不仅提升了自动驾驶车辆的安全性和效率，还通过更短的路线减少了燃料或电池消耗，展示了其在自动驾驶及其他具身AI领域的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [8] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MObI和AnydoorMed两种新型合成数据生成方法，分别用于自动驾驶和医学影像分析，通过扩散模型实现高真实性和可控性的多模态修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界数据的采集成本高且复杂，合成数据方法在安全关键应用中变得越来越重要。然而，这些方法需要高度的真实性和可控性才能发挥作用。

Method: MObI是一种多模态对象修复框架，利用扩散模型在相机和激光雷达数据中生成真实且可控的对象修复。AnydoorMed则专注于医学影像领域，通过扩散模型在乳腺X光扫描中进行参考引导修复。

Result: MObI能够根据单一参考RGB图像，在指定3D位置无缝插入对象，保持语义一致性和多模态连贯性。AnydoorMed在医学影像中实现了细节保留良好的异常修复，保持了参考异常的结构完整性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MObI和AnydoorMed方法展示了基础模型在多模态参考引导修复中的广泛适用性，为构建高度真实、可控的多模态反事实场景铺平了道路。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个结合视觉和语言模型的自动驾驶系统，通过单一分支处理图像、地图和路径点，实现高效、准确的驾驶决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要同时处理几何精度和语义理解，但现有系统通常将它们分开处理，XYZ-Drive旨在通过单一模型实现二者的统一。

Method: XYZ-Drive使用轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层，将路径点与图像和地图信息融合，并通过部分微调的LLaMA-3.2 11B模型输出驾驶指令。

Result: 在MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving基准测试中，XYZ-Drive达到95%的成功率和0.80 SPL，优于PhysNav-DG 15%，碰撞率减半。

Conclusion: 早期、令牌级别的意图和地图布局融合能够实现准确、透明、实时的自动驾驶。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出E-FineR方法，结合LLMs和VLMs，无需训练即可实现开放集细粒度图像分类，性能与SOTA相当，适用于零样本和少样本场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的细粒度图像分类方法依赖于固定词汇和封闭集分类范式，限制了其在现实世界中的扩展性和适应性。现有方法在分类阶段未能充分利用LLMs的潜力，且过度依赖LLM提供的猜测类别名称。

Method: 提出了训练免费的方法Enriched-FineR（E-FineR），结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs），无需预定义类别标签即可实现开放集识别。

Result: E-FineR在细粒度视觉识别中达到最先进水平，同时在零样本和少样本分类中表现与现有SOTA相当，且无需训练和人工干预。

Conclusion: 论文提出了E-FineR方法，展示了在细粒度视觉识别中的最先进结果，并提供了更高的可解释性，突出了其在真实场景和新领域中的潜力。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合互补概念的两阶段OV-3DIS方法，通过3D提案生成和Alpha-CLIP分类，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OV-3DIS研究中的概念并非互斥而是互补，因此需要一种方法将这些概念结合并优化以解决关键挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：3D提案生成和实例分类。3D提案通过基于跟踪的聚合生成，并通过迭代合并/移除处理重叠或部分提案。分类阶段使用Alpha-CLIP替代标准CLIP模型，并引入标准化最大相似度（SMS）分数。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集的所有AP和AR指标上实现了最先进的性能，甚至超过了端到端的封闭词汇方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合多种互补概念的新方法，通过精心设计的配方解决了开放词汇3D实例分割（OV-3DIS）的关键挑战，并在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

TL;DR: X-NeMo 是一种零样本扩散肖像动画方法，通过端到端框架减少身份泄漏，生成高质量动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决了现有方法中身份泄漏和难以捕捉细微及极端表情的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散的零样本肖像动画管道 X-NeMo，通过从驱动视频中提取 1D 身份无关的潜在运动描述符，并通过交叉注意力控制图像生成中的运动。

Result: 实验表明，X-NeMo 在生成高度表达性动画且保持身份相似性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: X-NeMo 通过引入一种完全端到端的训练框架，显著减少了身份泄漏问题，并在生成高度表达性动画方面超越了现有基线。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

TL;DR: 提出一种神经逆渲染方法，通过神经隐式场联合优化几何、反射率和光照，无需光照校准或中间线索，优于现有技术。

Motivation: 为了解决现有多视图光度立体方法需要光照校准或中间线索的问题，提出了一种直接从原始图像联合优化所有场景参数的单阶段方法。

Method: 该方法通过神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，应用阴影感知体积渲染，并通过空间网络和反射率网络联合优化所有场景参数。

Result: 该方法在形状和光照估计精度上优于现有技术，能够处理具有挑战性的几何和反射率对象，并适用于视图未对齐的多光源图像。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的神经逆渲染方法在形状和光照估计精度上优于现有技术，能够处理具有挑战性的几何和反射率对象，并适用于视图未对齐的多光源图像。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

  Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to develop a system that automatically
assesses fruit quality for
  farm inventory management. Specifically, a method for mango fruit
classification was developed using
  image processing, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. Resnet-18 was
selected as the preliminary
  architecture for classification, while a cascade detector was used for
detection, balancing execution speed
  and computational resource consumption. Detection and classification results
were displayed through a
  graphical interface developed in MatLab App Designer, streamlining system
interaction. The integration
  of convolutional neural networks and cascade detectors proffers a reliable
solution for fruit classification
  and detection, with potential applications in agricultural quality control.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的Corner Loss和R-CBAM模块有效提升了单图像雨线去除的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动检索方法缺乏直观的用户交互模式，且未充分利用模态的序列表示来提升检索性能。

Method: 通过序列级对比学习方法，构建了一个细粒度的联合嵌入空间，首次在运动检索中引入音频模态以增强用户沉浸感和便利性。

Result: 在HumanML3D数据集上，文本到运动检索的R@10指标提升了10.16%，视频到运动检索的R@1指标提升了25.43%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的四模态联合嵌入框架在运动检索任务中显著优于现有方法，尤其是在文本到运动和视频到运动检索子任务上分别实现了10.16%和25.43%的性能提升。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

TL;DR: AGD通过将目标语义注入扩散模型的噪声组件中，生成对抗图像，有效欺骗MLLMs并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决使用扩散模型生成对抗图像以欺骗多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）并避免显著扭曲原始图像的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种对抗引导扩散（AGD）方法，通过将目标语义注入反向扩散的噪声组件中，生成对抗图像。

Result: AGD在攻击性能和防御鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGD方法在对抗攻击性能和模型鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

Motivation: 食品晶体团聚现象影响产品质量，但由于水的透明性和二维显微图像的局限性，手动标注团聚极为困难。

Method: 首先提出一个监督基线模型生成分割伪标签，然后训练一个同时执行像素级分割的实例分类模型。在推理阶段结合两者的优势，并设计后处理模块以保留晶体特性。

Result: 与现有方法相比，本文方法提高了团聚分类的准确性和尺寸分布预测能力，并在不同置信度水平下成功分类潜在团聚实例。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过结合监督基线模型和实例分类模型，显著提高了食品晶体团聚的分类准确性和尺寸分布预测能力，并在不同置信度水平下验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在道路损伤检测中存在多尺度特征提取不足和计算资源需求高的问题，限制了实际应用中的实时检测效率。

Method: 设计了双向多尺度空间金字塔池化快速模块（BMS-SPPF）以增强多尺度特征提取，并采用分层通道压缩策略减少计算复杂度。

Result: 在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上，YOLO-ROC的mAP50达到67.6%，较基线YOLOv8n提升2.11%，小目标D40类别的mAP50提升16.8%，模型大小仅2.0 MB。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

Method: 提出了模糊引导的可学习分布校准（ALDC）策略，动态利用丰富的基类样本来纠正少样本新类别的有偏特征分布。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，ALDC策略优于现有方法，取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 本文通过重新定义广义半监督少样本类增量学习（GSemi-FSCIL），并提出了一种模糊引导的可学习分布校准（ALDC）策略，显著提升了模型性能，在三个基准数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统在多样化、非结构化真实世界文档中查询优化的挑战，无需依赖人工标注数据集。

Method: 通过强化学习框架RL-QR和广义奖励策略优化（GRPO），训练针对特定检索器的查询重写器。

Result: RL-QR在工业内部数据上表现优异，多模态和词汇检索器的NDCG@3分别提升了11%和9%，但在语义和混合检索器上未观察到改进。

Conclusion: RL-QR框架展示了在无需人工标注数据的情况下优化RAG系统查询的潜力，尤其在文本和多模态数据库中表现显著，但在语义和混合检索器上的性能仍有待改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based

presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of

TL;DR: 提出了TGSI评价指标和SATL损失函数，通过多组件损失增强时间序列的几何结构建模，实验证明其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值指标（如MSE）无法评估时间序列数据的几何结构，而几何结构对理解时间动态至关重要。为了解决这一问题，提出了TGSI评价指标，但由于图像变换过程不可微分，TGSI无法直接作为训练损失。

Method: 引入了Shape-Aware Temporal Loss (SATL)，一个多组件的损失函数，包括一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失，以增强训练过程中的结构建模。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI指标上均优于基线方法，且推理时无需额外计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出的SATL损失函数通过结合一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失，有效提升了时间序列数据的几何结构建模能力，实验证明SATL在MSE和TGSI指标上均优于基线方法。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field

This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep

method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模多标签数据集上的实验表明，该方法在标签有限的情况下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SATL算法通过动态更新类别特定阈值和差分排名损失，显著提升了在部分标签场景下的多标签图像识别性能。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

Conclusion: 构建的RAGNet基准和AffordanceNet框架在开放世界场景中展现出强大的泛化能力，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code
is available at https://github.com/wudongming97/AffordanceNet.

TL;DR: PixNerd通过神经场建模patch-wise解码，提出了一种高效的端到端图像生成方法，避免了复杂流程和VAE，取得了优异的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于预训练VAE的两阶段训练范式存在累积误差和解码伪影问题，而现有像素空间方法又过于复杂，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用神经场建模patch-wise解码，提出PixelNerd框架，实现了单尺度和单阶段的端到端训练。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256和512×512上分别达到2.15和2.84 FID，文本到图像任务中在GenEval和DPG基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: PixNerd提出了一种单尺度、单阶段、高效的端到端解决方案，通过神经场建模实现了高质量的图像生成，避免了复杂的级联流程和VAE的使用，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了SAM2模型在低成本、最小输入的3D乳腺癌MRI肿瘤分割中的应用，发现中心向外传播策略效果最佳，为资源受限环境提供了可行的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI工具在加速医学图像分析方面具有潜力，但在低收入和中等收入国家，商业医疗AI产品的采用受到高许可成本、专有软件和基础设施需求的限制。

Method: 使用单个边界框注释在一个切片上，通过三种不同的切片跟踪策略（从上到下、从下到上、从中心向外）传播分割预测。

Result: 中心向外传播策略产生了最一致和准确的分割，尽管SAM2是一个未经体积医学数据训练的零样本模型，但在最小监督下仍实现了强大的分割性能。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型如SAM2可以在最小监督下支持3D医学图像分析，为资源受限的环境提供了一种可访问且经济实惠的替代方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: iLRM通过迭代优化和三项核心设计原则，解决了现有3D重建方法的计算效率问题，显著提升了多视图输入下的重建质量和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer架构的前馈3D建模方法因多视图全注意力机制导致计算成本过高，难以扩展。iLRM旨在解决这一可扩展性和效率问题。

Method: 提出了一种迭代式大型3D重建模型（iLRM），通过解耦场景表示、两阶段注意力机制和高分辨率信息注入，实现了高效且高质量的3D高斯表示生成。

Result: 在RE10K和DL3DV等数据集上，iLRM在重建质量和速度上均优于现有方法，且在相同计算成本下能高效利用更多输入视图。

Conclusion: iLRM通过迭代优化机制和三项核心原则，显著提升了3D重建的质量和速度，尤其在多视图输入下展现出卓越的可扩展性。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

TL;DR: UniLIP通过两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略扩展CLIP功能，实现理解、生成和编辑的统一，性能超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP统一方法需要额外组件支持重建和生成任务，导致性能下降或重建不一致，UniLIP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方案和自蒸馏策略，逐步将重建能力整合到CLIP中，并提出双条件架构连接MLLM和扩散变换器。

Result: 在文本到图像生成任务中，UniLIP在GenEval和WISE基准上分别获得0.87和0.53分，图像编辑任务中得分为3.62，均超越同类模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP成功扩展了CLIP的应用范围，使其在保持原有理解性能的同时，在生成和编辑任务中也表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

TL;DR: BLiM框架通过双向似然估计和CPN模块解决MLLMs检索中的候选先验偏差问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的检索方法存在候选先验偏差问题，即倾向于高先验候选而非与查询更相关的候选。

Method: 提出了BLiM框架，通过双向似然估计（生成文本和视频特征）和候选先验归一化（CPN）模块来优化检索。

Result: 在四个文本-视频检索基准测试中，BLiM+CPN平均R@1提升6.4%，显著优于之前的最优模型。

Conclusion: BLiM框架结合CPN模块在文本-视频检索任务中显著优于现有方法，有效缓解候选先验偏差，并强调了查询-候选相关性。CPN模块在多模态任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

Motivation: 现有文档布局分析在区域合并、分割和内容缺失等结构错误检测上存在不足，传统评估指标（如IoU和mAP）无法有效识别这些错误。

Method: 提出LED基准，定义八种标准化错误类型，构建三个互补任务，并基于DLA模型的经验分布生成合成数据集LED-Dataset。

Result: 实验表明，LED能有效区分大型多模态模型的结构理解能力，暴露传统指标无法发现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的Layout Error Detection（LED）基准和LED-Dataset能有效评估文档布局预测的结构鲁棒性，揭示了传统指标无法捕捉的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的编辑方法在单一步骤中处理所有相关子任务时，对于大或结构复杂的变换效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种解耦的流程，将对象变换、源区域修复和目标区域细化分开处理，并使用无需训练的扩散方法 FreeFine 实现修复和细化。

Result: 在包含 2D 和 3D 编辑场景的 GeoBench 基准测试中，FreeFine 在图像保真度和编辑精度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFine 在几何图像编辑任务中表现出色，尤其在处理复杂或大范围变换时，通过解耦的流程显著提升了图像保真度和编辑精度。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

Motivation: 轻量级卷积和基于Transformer的模型在资源受限的应用（如嵌入式系统和边缘设备）中实时图像分类至关重要。

Method: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上训练七种高效深度学习架构，包括EfficientNetV2-S、ConvNeXt-T、MobileViT v2 (XXS/XS/S)、MobileNetV3-L、TinyViT-21M和RepVGG-A2，采用一致的训练设置，重点研究超参数调整的影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建适用于实时图像处理管道的资源高效深度学习模型提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

TL;DR: ST-SAM introduces a self-training framework for SSCOD that uses hybrid prompts and dynamic pseudo-labeling to achieve high performance with minimal labeled data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing SSCOD methods, such as prediction bias, error propagation, and high computational overhead, ST-SAM proposes a concise framework that reduces reliance on costly annotations.

Method: ST-SAM employs a Self-Training strategy to dynamically filter and expand high-confidence pseudo-labels, utilizing hybrid prompts to leverage the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks.

Result: Experiments show ST-SAM outperforms existing SSCOD methods with only 1% labeled data, matching fully supervised methods while requiring only a single network.

Conclusion: ST-SAM establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD by achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, outperforming existing methods and matching fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉 token 剪枝方法在自动驾驶场景中表现不佳，而人类驾驶员在驾驶时专注于相关前景区域，因此保留包含前景信息的视觉 token 对高效决策至关重要。

Method: 提出了 FastDriveVLA 框架，包含一个名为 ReconPruner 的即插即用视觉 token 剪枝器，通过 MAE 风格的像素重建和对抗性前景-背景重建策略来训练剪枝器。

Result: FastDriveVLA 在 nuScenes 闭环规划基准测试中，在不同剪枝比例下均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA 提出了一种基于重建的视觉 token 剪枝框架，特别针对自动驾驶场景设计，通过 ReconPruner 优先保留前景信息，显著提升了决策效率，并在 nuScenes 基准测试中取得了最优结果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Conclusion: PriorFusion通过整合语义、几何和生成先验，显著提升了道路元素感知的准确性和一致性，尤其在复杂环境中表现优异。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Motivation: 探索基于transformer的文本到图像扩散模型在生成艺术作品时，如何内部表示内容与风格的概念，尤其是在缺乏明确训练指导的情况下。

Method: 利用跨注意力热图技术，将生成图像中的像素归因于特定的提示词，从而分离出内容描述词和风格描述词影响的图像区域。

Result: 研究发现扩散模型在不同艺术提示和风格要求下，展现出不同程度的内容与风格分离。内容词主要影响对象相关区域，而风格词则影响背景和纹理区域。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在没有明确监督的情况下，能够展现出对内容与风格概念的内部分离，这为我们理解大规模生成模型如何内部表示复杂艺术概念提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention

Motivation: 当前医学领域的视觉-语言预训练方法常简化临床报告为单一实体或碎片化标记，且依赖大量硬负样本，不适用于小规模医学数据集。

Method: 提出了Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA)框架，包括双向分组机制、阈值门控模块、实例感知组对齐损失和双向跨模态分组对齐模块。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，AGA在微调和零样本设置下均取得了优异的图像-文本检索和分类性能。

Conclusion: AGA框架通过自适应分组机制和双向跨模态对齐，显著提升了医学图像和报告的表示学习性能，尤其在图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex

implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional

machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

Motivation: 现有车道拓扑推理方法在利用时间信息提升检测和推理性能方面存在不足，尤其是对历史查询的过度依赖、姿态估计失败的脆弱性以及时间传播不足。

Method: 提出FASTopoWM框架，结合潜在查询和BEV世界模型，通过并行监督历史和初始化查询，增强快速与慢速系统间的相互强化。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2基准测试中，FASTopoWM在车道段检测（37.4% vs. 33.6% mAP）和中心线感知（46.3% vs. 41.5% OLS）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FASTopoWM通过引入潜在世界模型和快速-慢速系统框架，显著提升了车道段拓扑推理的性能，尤其在车道段检测和中心线感知方面超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Motivation: 联邦学习在非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）中的应用尚未充分探索，且分辨率变异性导致的性能下降（分辨率漂移）问题亟待解决。

Method: 提出RAF方法，利用基于热图的知识蒸馏，通过高分辨率输出（教师）与低分辨率输出（学生）之间的多分辨率知识蒸馏增强分辨率鲁棒性。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，RAF有效缓解分辨率漂移，显著提升性能，并展示其在其他依赖空间细节的任务中的通用性。

Conclusion: RAF（分辨率自适应联邦学习）通过热图知识蒸馏有效缓解分辨率漂移问题，显著提升了性能，并能无缝集成到现有FL框架中。此外，RAF在保留空间细节的任务中具有通用性。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

Conclusion: 提出的领域泛化框架通过引入隐式特征扰动和自适应一致性约束，显著提升了医学图像分割模型在未见临床领域的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Motivation: 随着不同规模和架构的分类器激增，选择合适模型的问题日益重要。虽然可以统计评估模型的分类准确性，但对模型决策过程的理解仍然有限。

Method: 提出使用最小充分像素集（minimal sufficient pixels sets）来衡量模型的‘集中度’，并通过比较像素集的位置、重叠和大小来评估不同架构的模型。

Result: 发现不同架构的模型在像素集的集中度上存在统计显著差异，且误分类与更大的像素集相关。

Conclusion: 不同架构的视觉模型在像素集的集中度（大小和位置）上表现出显著差异，特别是ConvNext和EVA模型与其他模型明显不同。此外，误分类的图像通常与更大的像素集相关。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework (NanoVerse YOLO + TSR-MCL) improves traffic sign recognition by addressing long-tail distribution and multi-scale challenges, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in traffic sign recognition: long-tail distribution and small target multi-scale feature extraction.

Method: The framework includes NanoVerse YOLO for detection (with RepVL-PAN and SPD-Conv modules) and TSR-MCL for classification (using Vision Transformer and rule-based BERT for multimodal contrastive learning).

Result: 78.4% mAP on TT100K dataset for long-tail detection, 91.8% accuracy, and 88.9% recall, outperforming mainstream algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning achieves state-of-the-art performance in traffic sign recognition, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

Method: 该方法结合了遮挡感知的2D高斯面元与语义引导的颜色增强，采用平面自适应高斯表示进行高效大规模建模，并利用分割引导的视频修复去除动态和静态前景物体，通过语义感知的HSV空间校正增强颜色一致性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架在复杂城市环境中显著优于现有方法，能够生成视觉一致且几何精确的道路表面重建。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Motivation: 现有的VRD模型在训练数据之外的关系上泛化能力不足，而基于提示调优的方法在处理新颖或复杂关系时表现不佳。因此，作者提出通过指令调优来更有效地适应VLMs。

Method: ART框架将VRD数据集转换为指令调优格式，并采用自适应采样算法，使视觉语言模型（VLM）专注于信息丰富的关系，同时保持泛化能力。

Result: ART在多个不同复杂度的测试数据集上显著优于基线方法，并能够推断未见过的关系概念，这是主流VRD方法所不具备的能力。

Conclusion: ART框架通过指令调优和自适应实例选择，显著提升了视觉关系检测（VRD）模型的泛化能力，特别是在处理未见过的复杂关系时表现出色，并展示了在实际场景分割中的应用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each

and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

*Ji Ma,Wei Suo,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）因计算成本高难以实用化。本文提出Short-LVLM（SVL）框架，通过优化VL标记和减少层间差距，无需训练即可高效压缩模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在多模态理解和推理方面表现出色，但其庞大的参数和高计算成本限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过识别非关键的视觉-语言（VL）标记和减少层间特征差距，提出了一种名为Short-LVLM（SVL）的新框架。

Result: 实验证明，直接应用NLP的层修剪方法对LVLM无效，而SVL框架能有效利用重要VL标记并减少特征差距，从而提升效率。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM（SVL）框架在无需训练、模型无关且高度兼容的情况下，实现了性能与效率的优越权衡。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

TL;DR: VMatcher是一种结合Mamba和Transformer的混合网络，用于高效半密集特征匹配，显著降低计算成本并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的方法依赖于Transformer的注意力机制，计算成本高，而Mamba的SSM模型能以线性复杂度实现类似或更好的性能，因此提出结合两者的优势。

Method: VMatcher采用混合Mamba-Transformer网络架构，结合了Mamba的线性复杂度和Transformer的注意力机制，并提出了多种配置（包括分层架构）。

Result: VMatcher在高效性上表现突出，能够快速推理并达到新的性能基准，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: VMatcher通过结合Mamba和Transformer的优势，提出了一种高效的半密集特征匹配方法，不仅性能优异，还能满足实时应用的需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowGaussian-VR通过速度场渲染和自适应密度策略，显著提升动态3D视频重建质量，减少模糊伪影并优化高斯轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅变形场在复杂运动和尺度变化的视频中容易过拟合，导致视觉质量下降，且静态场景的梯度密度策略不适用于动态内容。

Method: 提出了FlowGaussian-VR，包含速度场渲染（VFR）管道和流辅助自适应密度（FAD）策略，用于优化动态场景的高斯视频重建。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上验证，FlowGaussian-VR在动态重建和新视角合成中表现出显著视觉改进（PSNR提升超过2.5 dB），动态纹理模糊伪影减少，高斯轨迹更规则且可追踪。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR 通过速度场渲染管道和流辅助自适应密度策略，显著提升了动态场景下的3D视频重建质量，减少了模糊伪影，并实现了更规则且可追踪的高斯轨迹。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

TL;DR: UniEmo是一个统一框架，通过分层情感理解链和扩散模型，整合情感理解与生成任务，并通过双重反馈机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感理解和生成任务虽然互补，但通常被分开处理。本文旨在通过统一的框架UniEmo，将这两个任务无缝整合，以相互增强性能。

Method: 提出了一种分层情感理解链，结合可学习的专家查询提取多尺度情感特征，并融合这些特征指导扩散模型生成情感图像。进一步引入了情感相关系数和情感条件损失以增强生成图像的多样性和保真度。

Result: 实验表明，UniEmo在情感理解和生成任务上均显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: UniEmo框架通过联合训练和生成驱动的双重反馈过程，显著提升了情感理解和生成任务的性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

TL;DR: MP^2A通过渐进式对齐策略优化CLIP在无监督域适应中的表现，减少噪声影响并在多个基准测试中达到最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的无监督域适应方法通常一次性对齐所有伪标记数据，容易因噪声和难分类样本导致误差传播和特征学习不佳。多源场景下问题更为复杂。

Method: 提出了一种渐进对齐策略（MP^2A），先从高置信度的目标样本开始训练，逐步引入更具挑战性的样本，以减少初始标签噪声的影响并优化特征学习。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet三个基准测试中，MP^2A相比现有方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MP^2A通过渐进对齐策略有效减少了标签噪声的影响，提升了CLIP模型在无监督域适应任务中的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端的GUI grounding模型在挑战性基准测试中的准确率不足65%，远未达到实际应用要求，因此需要改进模型训练方法以提高性能。

Method: 通过实证研究，从数据收集到模型训练的各个环节进行详细分析，最终开发了Phi-Ground模型家族。

Result: Phi-Ground模型在5个基准测试中均取得了最优性能，在端到端模型设置下，ScreenSpot-pro和UI-Vision的得分分别为43.2和27.2。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Phi-Ground模型家族在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，为GUI grounding模型的构建提供了重要参考，并可能对其他感知任务产生积极影响。

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other

Motivation: 解决3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在初始化敏感性、空间感知有限和高斯间相关性弱等方面的局限性，通过结合NeRF的连续空间表示提升3DGS的性能。

Method: NeRF-GS框架通过联合优化NeRF和3DGS，重新设计了3DGS并逐步对齐其空间特征与NeRF，利用共享的3D空间信息优化两种表示，并通过优化隐式特征和高斯位置的残差向量增强3DGS的个性化能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，NeRF-GS超越了现有方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: NeRF-GS框架通过结合NeRF和3DGS的优势，证明了这两种方法具有互补性而非竞争性，为3D场景表示提供了新的混合方法视角。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

Method: 提出了一种基于Stein score-based denoising diffusion model（SBDDM）的重建自由OOD检测方法，通过捕获扩散轨迹的曲率进行异常评分，仅需五个扩散步骤。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于机器学习的系统能够有效检测蜂蜜中的糖浆掺假，总体交叉验证准确率高达96.39%，为当前化学检测方法提供了合适的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Motivation: 艺术风格分类在计算美学中面临专家标注数据集稀缺和风格元素复杂非线性交互的挑战，现有双教师自监督框架因线性投影层和局部焦点难以建模全局构图上下文和复杂风格特征交互。

Method: 通过将传统的MLP投影和预测头替换为Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)，增强了双教师知识蒸馏框架，利用KANs的基于样条的激活功能以数学精度建模非线性特征相关性。

Result: 在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Top-1准确率上优于基础双教师架构。

Conclusion: 研究强调了KANs在解构复杂风格流形中的重要性，相比MLP投影，能带来更好的线性探测准确率。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

Motivation: 随着高光谱数据在遥感领域的快速增长，高效存储需求日益突出，而学习型高光谱图像压缩的研究尚未全面探讨光谱和空间压缩的单独及联合影响。

Method: 提出了一种名为HyCASS的学习模型，包括六个主要模块：光谱编码器、空间编码器、压缩比适配编码器、压缩比适配解码器、空间解码器和光谱解码器模块。这些模块采用卷积层和Transformer块来捕捉短程和长程冗余。

Conclusion: 基于实验结果，本研究提出了一种在不同压缩比下有效平衡光谱和空间压缩的指南，并考虑了HSI的空间分辨率。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪数据集在场景复杂性和属性多样性方面不足，限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了CST Anti-UAV数据集，包含220个视频序列和超过240k的高质量边界框标注，并对20种现有SOT方法进行了性能评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，在复杂环境中跟踪微小无人机仍具挑战性，最先进方法的准确率仅为35.92%。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV数据集的发布将促进更鲁棒的单目标跟踪方法的发展，并推动反无人机系统的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入多任务神经网络，成功在小肠胶囊内窥镜中实现了自我定位和异常检测的双重功能，显著提升了电池寿命和模型效率。

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Result: 在未对齐的多模态图像上进行了大量实验，结果显示Hy-CycleAlign在图像对齐和融合方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hy-CycleAlign是首个基于双曲空间的图像配准方法，通过双路径跨模态循环配准框架和双曲层次对比对齐模块，显著提升了多模态图像的配准和融合质量。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss框架在Phoenix14T和CSL-Daily基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Conclusion: MoGA方法通过结合生成式3D头像模型和2D扩散模型的合成视图，显著提升了单视角图像重建3D高斯头像的保真度和一致性，超越了现有技术，并适用于现实场景。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的纯2D方向性方法，有效平衡了3D占用预测的准确性和推理速度，适用于自动驾驶系统的实时部署。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Vcamba通过结合空间和频率特征，提出了一种高效且准确的视频伪装物体检测方法，实验结果表明其在6个评估指标上优于现有方法，且计算成本更低。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

*Yucheng Xie,Fu Feng,Ruixiao Shi,Jing Wang,Yong Rui,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DivControl 是一个可分解预训练框架，通过 SVD 分解和知识转移实现高效可控生成，显著降低训练成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么为每个条件训练单独模型，要么依赖纠缠表示的统一架构，导致泛化能力差且适应新条件成本高。DivControl 旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DivControl 通过 SVD 分解 ControlNet 为基本组件（奇异向量对），并通过知识转移在多条件训练中解耦条件无关的 learngenes 和条件特定的 tailors。采用动态门进行软路由，并引入表示对齐损失以提升条件保真度。

Result: DivControl 在可控性上达到 SOTA，训练成本降低 36.4 倍，同时在基础条件上提升平均性能，并在未见条件上展示强零样本和少样本性能。

Conclusion: DivControl 通过可分解的预训练框架和知识转移机制，实现了统一可控生成和高效适应，显著提升了条件保真度和训练效率，同时展示了强大的零样本和少样本性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Conclusion: The proposed Forward-Forward (FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for SNNs effectively addresses the challenges of non-differentiability and computational complexity, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets while reducing resource consumption.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Method: 提出了一种任务无关的双模型蒸馏框架，通过教师模型（基于掩模-图像对）和学生模型（仅基于掩模）的参数空间噪声对齐和基于病变-背景比的自适应正则化进行训练，采样阶段仅使用学生模型。

Conclusion: Adaptively Distilled ControlNet框架在隐私保护和性能提升方面表现出色，显著提高了分割模型的性能，并在两个医学数据集上实现了最先进的成果。

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Conclusion: OmniTraj通过显式条件化时间元数据，实现了在未见数据集上的零样本迁移，并在微调后达到了多个数据集的最先进性能。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative

effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal

different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for

Conclusion: I2V-GS通过基础设施到车辆视角的转换，显著提高了自动驾驶数据集合成的质量，并在多项指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: DIAS通过重新初始化和自蒸馏技术，显著提升了对象中心学习在对象发现和识别任务中的性能，同时改进了先进的视觉预测和推理能力。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种'半物理'机制，成功地将SMPL-X模型嵌入到动态物理交互中，解决了传统基于运动学模型在交互中的穿透和不真实动态问题，同时保持了实时性和运动保真度。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Conclusion: 该方法通过精心对齐每个摄像头的独立单目重建，实现了时间和视角一致的动态场景重建，在稀疏视角设置下显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单视频生成高质量动态3D内容的新框架，利用Direct 4DMesh-to-GS VAE和扩散模型，显著优于现有方法，泛化能力强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接4D扩散建模由于数据构建成本高且需联合表示3D形状、外观和运动的高维特性而极具挑战性。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过引入Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE，直接编码规范高斯样条（GS）及其时间变化，无需逐实例拟合，并将高维动画压缩到紧凑的潜在空间中。基于此表示，训练了一个高斯变化场扩散模型，结合时间感知的扩散变换器，以输入视频和规范GS为条件。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集的动画3D对象上训练的模型，生成质量优于现有方法，并在合成数据训练的背景下对野外视频输入表现出显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架在生成高质量动态3D内容方面表现出色，尤其在处理野外视频输入时展现出卓越的泛化能力，为生成高质量动画3D内容开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 通过编码照明中的噪声调制创建时间水印，为视频真实性验证提供信息不对称优势，对抗伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频伪造技术的快速发展使得伪造视频越来越难以被识别，因此需要一种能够创建信息不对称优势的方法来验证视频的真实性。

Method: 在场景照明中编码细微的、类似噪声的调制，为视频添加时间水印，该水印编码了未篡改场景在特定照明下的图像。

Result: 该方法即使在被对手知晓的情况下，也能迫使对手在信息劣势下解决更复杂的伪造问题，从而有效提升视频的真实性验证能力。

Conclusion: 通过编码场景照明中的细微噪声调制，可以创建一个信息不对称优势，从而有效对抗视频伪造，为高风险场景如公共事件和访谈提供保护。

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms
race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to
detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this
race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real
ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those
manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider
authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very
subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat
this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.
Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under
coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this
watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit
only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that
our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to
solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content
creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for
protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the
content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the
illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

TL;DR: XSpecMesh 通过轻量级多头推测解码和验证策略加速自回归网格生成，实现1.7倍加速且质量不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归模型生成高质量拓扑精确网格需要大量令牌预测，导致显著延迟，需要一种加速方法。

Method: XSpecMesh 采用轻量级多头推测解码方案，在单次前向传递中并行预测多个令牌，并结合验证和重采样策略以及蒸馏策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不牺牲生成质量的情况下实现了1.7倍的加速。

Conclusion: XSpecMesh 是一种质量保持的加速方法，能够在保持生成质量的同时实现1.7倍的加速，且代码将开源。

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究零售商在面临在线到达的供应商和客户时，如何在库存约束下最大化利润的问题。

Method: 采用指数权重更新的动态定价方案，并通过线性规划对偶拟合分析零售商利润与最优离线利润上限的关系。

Result: 设计了一个对数竞争比的在线算法，并证明了几乎匹配的下界，同时扩展到激励兼容机制。

Conclusion: 本文设计了一种具有对数竞争比的在线算法，用于零售商在供应商和客户在线到达时的捆绑交易问题，并通过指数权重更新的动态定价方案实现了这一目标。

Abstract: A retailer is purchasing goods in bundles from suppliers and then selling
these goods in bundles to customers; her goal is to maximize profit, which is
the revenue obtained from selling goods minus the cost of purchasing those
goods. In this paper, we study this general trading problem from the retailer's
perspective, where both suppliers and customers arrive online. The retailer has
inventory constraints on the number of goods from each type that she can store,
and she must decide upon arrival of each supplier/customer which goods to
buy/sell in order to maximize profit.
  We design an algorithm with logarithmic competitive ratio compared to an
optimal offline solution. We achieve this via an exponential-weight-update
dynamic pricing scheme, and our analysis dual fits the retailer's profit with
respect to a linear programming formulation upper bounding the optimal offline
profit. We prove (almost) matching lower bounds, and we also extend our result
to an incentive compatible mechanism. Prior to our work, algorithms for trading
bundles were known only for the special case of selling an initial inventory.

Result: DEA-OPTD算法在理论比较和实际测试中均表现出更优的性能。

Conclusion: DEA-OPTD算法在特定输入设置下表现优于广泛使用的算法，至少在96%的输入中表现更佳。

Abstract: Solving linear diophantine equations in two variables have applications in
computer science and mathematics. In this paper, we revisit an algorithm for
solving linear diophantine equations in two variables, which we refer as DEA-R
algorithm. The DEA-R algorithm always incurs equal or less number of recursions
or recursive calls as compared to extended euclidean algorithm. With the
objective of taking advantage of the less number of recursive calls , we
propose an optimized version of the DEA-R algorithm as DEA-OPTD. In the
recursive function calls in DEA-OPTD, we propose a sequence of more efficient
computations. We do a theoretical comparison of the execution times of DEA-OPTD
algorithm and DEA-R algorithm to find any possible bound on the value of $c$
for DEA-OPTD being better than DEA-R. We implement and compare an iterative
version of DEA-OPTD (DEA-OPTDI) with two versions of a widely used algorithm on
an specific input setting. In this comparison, we find out that our algorithm
outperforms on the other algorithm against atleast 96% of the inputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超图建模的分布式算法，通过多轮并行处理确保用户贡献限制，解决了大规模数据集中用户级差分隐私的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据集中单个记录可能拥有多个所有者，实施用户级差分隐私需要限制每个用户的总贡献，现有顺序算法计算密集且难以扩展到当今的大规模数据集。

Method: 该方法将所有权结构建模为超图，用户为顶点，记录为超边。算法通过多轮并行处理，用户提议记录，仅当所有所有者一致同意时，记录才被添加到最终数据集中，确保不违反任何用户的预定义贡献限制。

Result: 提出的分布式算法能够高效处理大规模数据集，最大化结果数据集的大小以提供高实用性，并为大型实际系统中实施用户级隐私提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖且高效的分布式算法，通过建模复杂的所有权结构为超图，并在多轮并行处理中确保用户贡献上限不被违反，从而解决了现代大规模数据集中用户级差分隐私实施的扩展性问题。

Abstract: In modern datasets, where single records can have multiple owners, enforcing
user-level differential privacy requires capping each user's total
contribution. This "contribution bounding" becomes a significant combinatorial
challenge. Existing sequential algorithms for this task are computationally
intensive and do not scale to the massive datasets prevalent today. To address
this scalability bottleneck, we propose a novel and efficient distributed
algorithm. Our approach models the complex ownership structure as a hypergraph,
where users are vertices and records are hyperedges. The algorithm proceeds in
rounds, allowing users to propose records in parallel. A record is added to the
final dataset only if all its owners unanimously agree, thereby ensuring that
no user's predefined contribution limit is violated. This method aims to
maximize the size of the resulting dataset for high utility while providing a
practical, scalable solution for implementing user-level privacy in large,
real-world systems.

product of Nyldon words. Nyldon words and Nyldon factorizations are recently
defined combinatorial objects inspired by the well-known Lyndon words and
Lyndon factorizations. In this paper, we investigate the Nyldon factorization
of several words. First, we fully characterize the Nyldon factorizations of the

there exists a non-decreasing product of Nyldon words that is a factorization

TL;DR: PancreasDG introduces a large multi-center 3D MRI dataset for pancreas segmentation, addressing cross-sequence and cross-center variability. A semi-supervised approach achieves significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreas segmentation is clinically important but challenging due to the organ's small size, irregular shape, and low T1 contrast. Existing datasets and methods overlook cross-sequence variability, which is a dominant source of variability in MR protocols.

Method: The study presents PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas segmentation dataset, and proposes a semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances to address cross-center and cross-sequence variations.

Result: The proposed semi-supervised approach achieves 61.63% Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques.

Conclusion: PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging by addressing the under-representation of pancreas segmentation in public datasets and providing a comprehensive multi-center 3D MRI dataset. The proposed semi-supervised approach leveraging anatomical invariances significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

*Weicheng Xue,Baisong Xu,Kai Yang,Yongxiang Liu,Dengdeng Fan,Pengxiang Xu,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: H2SGEMM 是一种在仅支持 FP16 的 AI 加速器上模拟 FP32 GEMM 的高性能算法，通过分解操作数和可调缩放策略补偿误差，实现了高精度和高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低精度矩阵引擎（如 FP16 cube）提供高吞吐量，但不支持全精度计算。因此，需要一种高性能算法来在仅支持 FP16 计算单元的 AI 加速器上模拟 FP32 通用矩阵乘法（GEMM）。

Method: 该方法将每个 FP32 操作数分解为两个 FP16 值，并通过可调缩放策略补偿数值误差。详细分析了数值误差，包括下溢条件和精度损失，以指导缩放参数的选择，保留高达 22 位的尾数精度。此外，还研究了计算顺序对精度的影响，并证明在低指数区域中，逐项累加方案比传统的 FP32 GEMM 提高了数值稳定性。

Result: H2SGEMM 在缺乏原生 FP32 支持的 Ascend 910A NPU 上实现了高达 77% 的理论 FP32 等效峰值性能。广泛的数值实验证实，该方法不仅恢复了原生 FP32 GEMM 的精度，还在某些条件下表现出更优的数值稳定性。

Conclusion: H2SGEMM 不仅恢复了原生 FP32 GEMM 的精度，还在某些条件下表现出更优的数值稳定性，得益于其结构化和错误感知的计算顺序。

Abstract: Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but
lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose H2SGEMM,
a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix
multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI
accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and
compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed
analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision
loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of
mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on
accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves
numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes.
Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are
introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling H2SGEMM to
achieve up to 77% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend
910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm
that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also
exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its
structured and error-aware computation order.

TL;DR: RAES算法在动态图模型中保持良好扩展性，支持高效的PUSH和PULL协议信息传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAES算法在静态图假设下的局限性，探索其在动态图模型（如P2P网络中的节点流失和连接数限制）中的适用性。

Method: 通过流式节点流失过程（滑动窗口模型）模拟动态图，分析RAES算法在该模型下的行为，并验证其扩展性和信息传播效率。

Result: 动态图序列中的每个快照G_t均具有高概率的良好扩展性，且PUSH和PULL协议的完成时间上界为对数级别。

Conclusion: RAES算法在动态图模型中表现出色，每个快照G_t都具有良好的扩展性，且能有效支持PUSH和PULL协议的快速信息传播。

Abstract: A randomized distributed algorithm called RAES was introduced in [Becchetti
et al., SODA 2020] to extract a bounded-degree expander from a dense $n$-vertex
expander graph $G = (V, E)$. The algorithm relies on a simple threshold-based
procedure. A key assumption in [Becchetti et al., SODA 2020] is that the input
graph $G$ is static - i.e., both its vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ remain
unchanged throughout the process - while the analysis of RAES in dynamic models
is left as a major open question.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of RAES under a dynamic graph model
induced by a streaming node-churn process (also known as the sliding window
model), where, at each discrete round, a new node joins the graph and the
oldest node departs. This process yields a bounded-degree dynamic graph
$\mathcal{G} =\{ G_t = (V_t, E_t) : t \in \mathbb{N}\}$ that captures essential
characteristics of peer-to-peer networks -- specifically, node churn and
threshold on the number of connections each node can manage. We prove that
every snapshot $G_t$ in the dynamic graph sequence has good expansion
properties with high probability. Furthermore, we leverage this property to
establish a logarithmic upper bound on the completion time of the well-known
PUSH and PULL rumor spreading protocols over the dynamic graph $\mathcal{G}$.

Conclusion: PRIME通过伪随机轮询包喷洒方法，结合网络拓扑优化负载分配和性能，显著提升了网络性能，特别是在排列流量和网络退化场景下。

Abstract: Large-scale distributed training in production data centers place significant
demands on network infrastructure. In particular, significant load balancing
challenges arise when processing AI/ML workloads, consisting of low-entropy,
bursty and long-lived flows. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as
Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) struggle to maintain high network utilization.
While major industry players (e.g., Ultra Ethernet Consortium) and parts of
academia have proposed packet spraying to enhance AI/ML workload performance,
we argue that existing packet spraying solutions lead to buffer inflation over
time, negatively affecting network performance. Specifically, when ACK
coalescing is used, these solutions lead to stale information, degrading
network performance. Additionally, in asymmetric network conditions- such as
mix of ordered an unordered traffic, or link degradation and failures- existing
packet spraying solutions often lead to increased tail latency. In this paper,
we present the design and evaluation of PRIME, a pseudo-randomized round-robin
approach to packet spraying that considers the network topology to optimize
load distribution and performance. PRIME uses congestion as an indicator to
re-balance the load. To this extent, PRIME takes into account various
congestion signals, accounting for congestion severity, and their decay times
to avoid network hotspots. We extensively evaluated PRIME using large-scale
production-level simulator. Our results indicate that, compared to existing
solutions, PRIME leads to up to 15% improvement for permutation traffic and up
to 27% improvement in network degradation scenarios

regions force User Equipments (UEs) to increase transmit power, and in
directional millimeter wave systems, where beamforming sidelobes can create
unexpected interference. The resulting signal degradation disrupts protocol
operations, including scheduling and resource allocation, by distorting quality
indicators like Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI), and can compromise critical functions such as
channel state reporting and Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)
acknowledgments. To address this problem, this article introduces InterfO-RAN,
a real-time programmable solution that leverages a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) to process In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) samples in the gNB physical
layer, detecting in-band interference with accuracy exceeding 91% in under 650
us. InterfO-RAN represents the first O-RAN dApp accelerated on Graphics
Processing Unit (GPU), coexisting with the 5G NR physical layer processing of
NVIDIA Aerial. Deployed in an end-to-end private 5G network with commercial
Radio Units (RUs) and smartphones, our solution was trained and tested on more
than 7 million NR UL slots collected from real-world environments,
demonstrating robust interference detection capabilities essential for
maintaining network performance in dense deployments.

TL;DR: 本文研究了分组化对Aloha方案中排队延迟的影响，提出了最优分组策略，并在NTN场景中进行了案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低延迟服务的需求增长，现有研究大多将数据包视为原子传输单元，忽略了分组化对排队延迟的影响，尤其是以秒为单位的平均排队延迟。

Method: 通过数学建模和数值方法，分析了分组化与平均排队延迟之间的关系，并进行了仿真验证。

Result: 研究确定了最优的平均排队延迟及其对应的分组大小，并分析了网络参数的影响。此外，还通过仿真研究了分组化对延迟抖动的影响。

Conclusion: 本研究通过建立数学模型，分析了分组化对Aloha方案中平均排队延迟的影响，并提出了最优分组策略。此外，研究还探讨了分组化对延迟抖动的影响，并在NTN场景中进行了案例研究。

Abstract: As the demand for low-latency services grows, ensuring the delay performance
of random access (RA) networks has become a priority. Existing studies on the
queueing delay performance of the Aloha model universally treat packets as
atomic transmission units, focusing primarily on delay measured in time slots.
However, the impact of packetization on queueing delay has been consistently
overlooked, particularly for the mean queueing delay measured in seconds, which
serves as a more precise and practically relevant performance metric than its
slot-based counterpart. Here, packetization refers to the process of
determining the number of bits assembled into a packet. To optimize queueing
delay from the perspective of packetization, this paper establishes the
mathematical relationship between packetization and mean queueing delay in
seconds for both connection-free and connection-based Aloha schemes, and
explores the optimal packetization strategy to minimize this delay. We identify
the optimal mean queueing delay and its corresponding packet size via numerical
methods, and further analyze the influence of various network parameters. We
further use simulations to investigate the similar impact of packetization on
jitter of queueing delay. We then apply our analysis to re-evaluate the complex
trade-off between the connection-free and connection-based schemes through the
new perspective of packetization. Furthermore, recognizing that an analysis of
the queueing delay performance for RA-SDT in NTN scenarios, especially from a
packetization perspective, also remains an unexplored area, we apply the
analysis to this scenario as a case study.

TL;DR: FAST-LoRa是一种新型模拟框架，通过解析模型和高效矩阵运算，快速评估LoRaWAN网络，显著减少计算时间，同时保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模拟框架虽然能准确复现现实场景，但计算开销和模拟时间较大。FAST-LoRa旨在解决这一问题，提供快速高效的LoRaWAN网络评估和传输参数选择。

Method: FAST-LoRa通过依赖解析模型而非复杂的包级模拟，并使用高效的矩阵运算实现网关接收，简化了计算过程。

Result: FAST-LoRa在估计关键网络指标时表现出与成熟模拟器相似的准确性，同时计算时间减少了多达三个数量级。

Conclusion: FAST-LoRa作为一种轻量级且准确的近似工具，适用于评估传输参数策略，特别是在稳定流量模式和上行链路为主的通信场景中，显著减少了计算时间。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed many industries, and LoRaWAN
(Long Range Wide Area Network), built on LoRa (Long Range) technology, has
become a crucial solution for enabling scalable, low-cost, and energy-efficient
communication in wide-area networks. Simulation tools are essential for
optimizing the transmission parameters and, therefore, the energy efficiency
and performance of LoRaWAN networks. While existing simulation frameworks
accurately replicate real-world scenarios by including multiple layers of
communication protocols, they often imply significant computational overhead
and simulation times. To address this issue, this paper introduces FAST-LoRa, a
novel simulation framework designed to enable fast and efficient evaluation of
LoRaWAN networks and selection of transmission parameters. FAST-LoRa
streamlines computation by relying on analytical models without complex
packet-level simulations and implementing gateway reception using efficient
matrix operations. Rather than aiming to replace discrete-event simulators,
FAST-LoRa is intended as a lightweight and accurate approximation tool for
evaluating transmission parameter strategies in scenarios with stable traffic
patterns and uplink-focused communications. In our evaluation, we compare
FAST-LoRa with a well-established simulator using multiple network
configurations with varying numbers of end devices and gateways. The results
show that FAST-LoRa achieves similar accuracy in estimating key network
metrics, even in complex scenarios with interference and multi-gateway
reception, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.940 $\times 10^{-2}$ for the
Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and 0.040 bits/mJ for Energy Efficiency (EE), while
significantly reducing computational time by up to three orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的双模式通信框架在统一时间帧结构中集成了查询驱动（pull）和事件驱动（push）传输，通过自适应方法确保数据的高效、及时传输，并显著降低能耗。

Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-mode communication framework for wireless
devices that integrates query-driven (pull) and event-driven (push)
transmissions within a unified time-frame structure. Devices typically respond
to information requests in pull mode, but if an anomaly is detected, they
preempt the regular response to report the critical condition. Additionally,
push-based communication is used to proactively send critical data without
waiting for a request. This adaptive approach ensures timely, context-aware,
and efficient data delivery across different network conditions. To achieve
high energy efficiency, we incorporate a wake-up radio mechanism and we design
a tailored medium access control (MAC) protocol that supports data traffic
belonging to the different communication classes. A comprehensive system-level
analysis is conducted, accounting for the wake-up control operation and
evaluating three key performance metrics: the success probability of anomaly
reports (push traffic), the success probability of query responses (pull
traffic) and the total energy consumption. Numerical results characterize the
system's behavior and highlight the inherent trade-off in success probabilities
between push- and pull-based traffic as a function of allocated communication
resources. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach reduces energy
consumption by up to 30% compared to a traditional approach, while maintaining
reliable support for both communication paradigms.

Conclusion: 论文通过分析VAoI的稳态分布，为高效通信网络设计提供了有价值的见解，特别是在单跳和多跳网络中不同调度策略下的表现。数值评估验证了分析结果。

Abstract: Timely and informative data dissemination in communication networks is
essential for enhancing system performance and energy efficiency, as it reduces
the transmission of outdated or redundant data. Timeliness metrics, such as Age
of Information (AoI), effectively quantify data freshness; however, these
metrics fail to account for the intrinsic informativeness of the content
itself. To address this limitation, content-based metrics have been proposed
that combine both timeliness and informativeness. Nevertheless, existing
studies have predominantly focused on evaluating average metric values, leaving
the complete distribution-particularly in multi-hop network scenarios-largely
unexplored. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the
stationary distribution of the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a
content-based metric, under various scheduling policies, including randomized
stationary, uniform, and threshold-based policies, with transmission
constraints in single-hop and multi-hop networks. We derive closed-form
expressions for the stationary distribution and average VAoI under these
scheduling approaches. Furthermore, for threshold-based scheduling, we
analytically determine the optimal threshold value that minimizes VAoI and
derive the corresponding optimal VAoI in closed form. Numerical evaluations
verify our analytical findings, providing valuable insights into leveraging
VAoI in the design of efficient communication networks.

Motivation: 由于计算资源和任务的物理属性多样化，复杂连接系统中任务与资源匹配的机制开发变得日益困难，需一种价值驱动的任务完成方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于超图的信任任务资源匹配（TTR-matching）框架，包括任务特定的信任物理资源超图定义、任务超图生成以及超图匹配算法设计。

Result: 实验结果表明，TTR-matching框架在识别任务特定可信合作者和最大化任务完成平均价值方面优于对比算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的TTR-matching框架通过超图建模和匹配算法，有效解决了复杂连接系统中任务与资源匹配的挑战，显著提升了任务完成的价值和可信度。

Abstract: Due to the diverse physical attributes of computing resources and tasks,
developing effective mechanisms to facilitate task and resource matching in
complex connected systems for value-oriented task completion has become
increasingly challenging. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a
networked physical computing system that integrates the physical attributes of
computing resources and tasks as well as task-specific trust relationships
among devices to enable value-driven task completion. Specifically, we propose
a state-of-the-art hypergraph-aided trusted task-resource matching
(TTR-matching) framework to achieve the envisioned physical computing. First, a
task-specific trusted physical resource hypergraph is defined, which integrates
task-specific trust, the physical attributes of resources, and task types. This
enables accurate modeling of device collaboration dependencies under specific
task types. Next, a task hypergraph is generated to associate the task
initiator with the physical attributes of the corresponding tasks. Based on
these two hypergraphs, a hypergraph matching algorithm is designed to
facilitate task-specific trusted collaborator selection and accurate
task-resource matching for value-maximizing task completion. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TTR-matching framework
outperforms comparison algorithms in identifying task-specific trustworthy
collaborators and maximizing the average value of task completion.

Motivation: 探索LLM从业务流程描述生成智能合约代码的潜力，以克服传统基于规则的代码生成方法的局限性。

Method: 引入自动化评估框架，并使用更大数据集的过程模型进行实证测试，评估不同类型和规模的LLM在实现流程执行关键属性（如流程流、资源分配和数据条件）方面的能力。

Result: LLM在智能合约开发中的表现未达到所需的完美可靠性。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型（LLM）在智能合约开发中无法达到所需的完美可靠性，建议未来探索在现有代码生成工具中负责任地集成LLM以提高输出可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FlowETL是一种自动化的ETL管道架构，通过示例学习自动标准化和准备数据集，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ETL解决方案需要大量人工参与设计和实现特定上下文的转换，缺乏自动设计和应用这些转换的能力。

Method: FlowETL是一个基于示例的自主ETL管道架构，包含规划引擎、ETL工作器以及监控和日志组件。

Result: FlowETL在14个不同领域、文件结构和大小的数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FlowETL展示了在多种数据集上的泛化能力，为ETL流程的自动化提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow is fundamental for populating and
maintaining data warehouses and other data stores accessed by analysts for
downstream tasks. A major shortcoming of modern ETL solutions is the extensive
need for a human-in-the-loop, required to design and implement
context-specific, and often non-generalisable transformations. While related
work in the field of ETL automation shows promising progress, there is a lack
of solutions capable of automatically designing and applying these
transformations. We present FlowETL, a novel example-based autonomous ETL
pipeline architecture designed to automatically standardise and prepare input
datasets according to a concise, user-defined target dataset. FlowETL is an
ecosystem of components which interact together to achieve the desired outcome.
A Planning Engine uses a paired input-output datasets sample to construct a
transformation plan, which is then applied by an ETL worker to the source
dataset. Monitoring and logging provide observability throughout the entire
pipeline. The results show promising generalisation capabilities across 14
datasets of various domains, file structures, and file sizes.

Abstract: There is a pressing need for better development methods and tools to keep up
with the growing demand and increasing complexity of new software systems. New
types of user interfaces, the need for intelligent components, sustainability
concerns, ... bring new challenges that we need to handle. In the last years,
model-driven engineering (MDE) has been key to improving the quality and
productivity of software development, but models themselves are becoming
increasingly complex to specify and manage. At the same time, we are witnessing
the growing popularity of vibe coding approaches that rely on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to transform natural language descriptions into running code at
the expenses of code vulnerabilities, scalability issues and maintainability
concerns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textit{vibe modeling} as
a novel approach to integrate the best of both worlds (AI and MDE) to speed up
the development of reliable complex systems. We outline the key concepts of
vibe modeling and highlight the opportunities and open challenges it presents
for the future of modeling.

Conclusion: GitHub Marketplace的持续集成（CI）工具存在大量功能冗余现象，约65%的新工具复制现有功能，且通常在六个月内完成。研究发布的数据集和图形模型为开发者提供了选择最佳发布时机、定位未满足功能的依据，并帮助维护者减少冗余工具。

Abstract: GitHub Marketplace is expanding by approximately 41% annually, with new

Method: 采用分治策略：首先生成设备控制逻辑，再合成平台兼容的集成代码，并通过多阶段调试管道确保正确性。

Result: 在34个物联网设备上测试，平均成功率为93.87%，功能覆盖率为94.87%，用户反馈后可达100%。

Conclusion: AutoBridge通过自动化生成物联网集成代码，显著减少了人工干预，成功率和功能覆盖率分别达到93.87%和94.87%，并在用户简单反馈后实现100%功能覆盖。

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average
success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any
human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code
is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15
participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by
50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use
commercial code LLMs.

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,
characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM
research challenges towards XABPs.

Motivation: 现有的代理框架在独立探索时容易陷入局部解决方案，难以识别跨代码库的问题模式。

Method: SWE-Debate首先通过遍历代码依赖图生成多个故障传播路径作为定位提案，然后组织三轮辩论，由不同推理视角的代理参与，最终整合出一个统一的修复计划。

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中，SWE-Debate表现优于现有基线，取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SWE-Debate框架通过多代理辩论机制显著提升了问题解决的效率和准确性，尤其在复杂软件工程任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Conclusion: SWE-Exp 通过引入经验增强方法，成功实现了软件工程代理的持续学习，将问题解决从试错探索转变为战略性的经验驱动模式，显著提高了解决率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of
LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still
face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the
capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their
overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first
agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to
support the research community, with all resources available at

TL;DR: 研究通过机器学习模型预测GitLab合并请求的代码审查努力，发现大多数请求需要调整，且复杂性和经验是主要影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管过去的研究探讨了代码审查的延迟和迭代次数，但基于代码变更量的努力研究较少，尤其是在GitLab合并请求的背景下。

Method: 使用一个包含23,600多个GitLab合并请求的数据集，定义并测量了代码审查的努力，训练了一个可解释的机器学习模型。

Result: 71%的合并请求在提交后需要调整，28%涉及超过200行代码的变更。机器学习模型表现优异（AUC 0.84-0.88），揭示了复杂性、经验和文本特征是关键预测因素。

Conclusion: 研究发现，机器学习模型能够有效解释和预测代码审查过程中所需的努力，强调了复杂性和开发者经验等因素的重要性。

Abstract: Code review (CR) is essential to software development, helping ensure that
new code is properly integrated. However, the CR process often involves
significant effort, including code adjustments, responses to reviewers, and
continued implementation. While past studies have examined CR delays and
iteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code
changes required, especially in the context of GitLab Merge Requests (MRs),
which remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as
the amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23,600
MRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require
adjustments after submission, and 28% of these involve changes to more than 200
lines of code. Surprisingly, this effort is not correlated with review time or
the number of participants. To better understand and predict CR effort, we
train an interpretable machine learning model using metrics across multiple
dimensions: text features, code complexity, developer experience, review
history, and branching. Our model achieves strong performance (AUC 0.84-0.88)
and reveals that complexity, experience, and text features are key predictors.
Historical project characteristics also influence current review effort. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of using machine learning to explain and
anticipate the effort needed to integrate code changes during review.

Motivation: 知识图谱补全（KGC）的后验可解释性缺乏形式化和一致的评估，阻碍了可重复性和跨研究比较。

Method: 提出了一个通过多目标优化平衡解释效果和简洁性的通用框架，统一了现有的KGC后验解释算法及其生成的解释。

Result: 通过改进的评估协议（如Mean Reciprocal Rank和Hits@$k$）和强调解释的实用性，支持了统一方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过统一方法和改进评估标准，本研究旨在使知识图谱补全（KGC）的可解释性研究更具可重复性和影响力。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探索了多模态大语言模型中推理能力与偏差缓解的权衡，发现强化学习训练的1:4混合样本比例能有效平衡两者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有的高级提示方案和后训练微调技术提高了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的逻辑准确性，但这些技术往往使模型输出带有明显的社会偏见。因此，明确推理能力提升与偏差缓解之间的相互作用以及这两个目标是否本质上存在权衡，是一个亟待解决的研究问题。

Method: 研究首先在相同条件下基准测试了三种偏差缓解策略：监督微调（SFT）、知识蒸馏（KD）和基于规则的强化学习（RL）。然后，通过改变每种策略中偏向去偏和推理中心样本的比例，绘制推理与偏差之间的权衡关系。

Result: 研究发现，强化学习训练的1:4混合样本比例是一个一致的甜点，能够在减少10%刻板印象分数的同时保留88%的原始推理准确率。

Conclusion: 研究发现，通过强化学习训练，大约1:4的混合样本比例可以在减少10%刻板印象分数的同时保留模型88%的原始推理准确率，为平衡多模态大语言模型的公平性和能力提供了具体指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现AI在听觉任务上表现远不如人类，失败率超93%，提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发（即对人类简单的任务对机器来说往往很困难，反之亦然），研究旨在量化AI系统在复杂听觉场景中的失败率，并探索失败原因。

Method: 研究引入了一个包含917项挑战的听觉图灵测试，涵盖七个类别，并对包括GPT-4音频能力和OpenAI Whisper在内的先进音频模型进行了评估。

Result: 评估显示，最先进的音频模型在人类轻松解决的任务上失败率超过93%，最佳模型准确率仅为6.9%，而人类成功率为52%。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前AI系统在听觉任务上的严重不足，并提出了一个诊断框架来衡量机器听觉的进步。同时，强调了在AI系统中整合选择性注意力、基于物理的音频理解和上下文感知的新方法的必要性。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在基于论证的判断预测中，如何通过一致性提升预测准确性，并揭示用户与一致性属性的实际差距。

Method: 通过三项评估：1）研究强制一致性对人类和LLM预测的影响；2）展示过滤不一致预测对准确性的提升；3）通过众包实验分析用户对一致性的认知。

Result: 过滤不一致预测显著提升了人类和LLM的预测准确性，但用户实验表明用户未普遍遵循一致性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了论证一致性（argumentative coherence）的概念，并通过实验证明其在人类和LLM预测中的价值，同时指出用户未普遍遵循这一属性，因此需要在基于论证的判断预测中引入过滤不一致意见的机制。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

Motivation: 研究Shapley-value-based责任度量在ontology-mediated查询回答中的计算复杂性，以理解其可行性边界。

Method: 利用数据库设置中的结果，研究WSMS责任度量的计算复杂性，特别是在本体介导查询回答的背景下。

Result: 对于可一阶重写的ontology-mediated查询类，WSMS度量具有多项式数据复杂性；而对于可以编码可达性查询的本体语言，问题变为shP-hard。

Conclusion: 论文通过详细分析，确定了在DL-Lite方言中，结构受限的联合查询类可以实现高效的WSMS计算。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

TL;DR: 提出新型SAS评分方法，结合Hybrid MILP框架，显著减少二进制变量数量并提升验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决复杂实例的处理问题，减少二进制变量的数量并提升验证效率。

Method: 采用了一种新型的solution-aware ReLU评分（SAS）方法，并改进了BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支函数作为全局ReLU评分（GS）函数。

Result: SAS方法将二进制变量数量减少约6倍，同时保持相同准确性；Hybrid MILP框架将未决实例数量减少高达40%，运行时间保持在合理范围内（平均每实例46-417秒）。

Conclusion: 通过提出的SAS评分方法和改进的分支策略，结合Hybrid MILP框架，显著减少了二进制变量的数量并保持了准确性，同时提升了验证效率。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

Motivation: 探讨最先进的推理模型是否能够稳健地执行因果发现任务，因为传统模型在此任务上常因数据扰动而出现过拟合和接近随机的性能。

Method: 研究使用OpenAI的o系列和DeepSeek-R模型家族在Corr2Cause基准上进行因果发现，并引入了一个模块化的上下文管道，该管道受到Tree-of-Thoughts和Chain-of-Thoughts方法的启发。

Result: 推理优先架构比先前方法取得了显著更高的原生增益，且引入的模块化上下文管道比传统基线提高了近三倍的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管先进推理模型代表了重大进步，但精心构建的上下文框架对于最大化其能力至关重要，并为跨领域的因果发现提供了通用蓝图。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Motivation: 现有图像分类器解释算法缺乏形式严谨性，而基于逻辑的解释虽严谨但计算依赖严格假设，不适用于图像分类器。

Method: 提出并实现了对比性因果解释和完全因果解释的定义，证明了因果解释的形式属性。

Result: 实现了高效计算，平均每张图像在ResNet50模型上仅需6秒，且完全黑盒，无需模型内部知识或梯度。

Conclusion: 因果解释不仅形式严谨，还能适用于黑盒算法，尤其适合图像分类器。实验证明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性方面表现出不同模式。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于语义信任链的自主信任编排方法，通过代理AI和超图技术，有效解决了分布式协作中的信任评估复杂性和资源消耗问题，实现了资源的高效利用和大规模系统的协调。

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Conclusion: MemoCue在记忆召回应用中表现出色，实验数据显示其在召回灵感方面优于基于LLM的方法17.74%，人类评估进一步验证了其优势。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Conclusion: Seed-Prover和Seed-Geometry在自动数学推理领域取得了显著进展，证明了结合形式验证与长链思维推理的有效性。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

Abstract: Automatic extrinsic sensor calibration is a fundamental problem for
multi-sensor platforms. Reliable and general-purpose solutions should be
computationally efficient, require few assumptions about the structure of the
sensing environment, and demand little effort from human operators. Since the
engineering effort required to obtain accurate calibration parameters increases
with the number of sensors deployed, robotics researchers have pursued methods
requiring few assumptions about the sensing environment and minimal effort from
human operators. In this work, we introduce a fast and certifiably globally
optimal algorithm for solving a generalized formulation of the
$\textit{robot-world and hand-eye calibration}$ (RWHEC) problem. The
formulation of RWHEC presented is "generalized" in that it supports the
simultaneous estimation of multiple sensor and target poses, and permits the
use of monocular cameras that, alone, are unable to measure the scale of their
environments. In addition to demonstrating our method's superior performance
over existing solutions, we derive novel identifiability criteria and establish
$\textit{a priori}$ guarantees of global optimality for problem instances with
bounded measurement errors. We also introduce a complementary Lie-algebraic
local solver for RWHEC and compare its performance with our global method and
prior art. Finally, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our
algorithms and experiments.

Abstract: Quadruped robots face persistent challenges in achieving versatile locomotion
due to limitations in reference motion data diversity. To address these
challenges, this approach introduces an in-between motion generation based
multi-style quadruped robot locomotion framework, integrating synergistic
advances in motion generation and imitation learning. Our approach establishes
a unified pipeline addressing two fundamental aspects: First, we propose a CVAE
based motion generator, synthesizing multi-style dynamically feasible
locomotion sequences between arbitrary start and end states. By embedding
physical constraints and leveraging joint poses based phase manifold
continuity, this component produces physically plausible motions spanning
multiple gait modalities while ensuring kinematic compatibility with robotic
morphologies. Second, we adopt the adversarial motion priors algorithm. We
validate the effectiveness of generated motion data in enhancing controller
stability and improving velocity tracking performance. The proposed framework

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

Method: 作者开发了一个名为MTBench的大规模并行化多任务基准测试平台，包含50个操作任务和20个运动任务，并集成了四种基础RL算法和七种先进的MTRL算法。

Conclusion: MTBench提供了一个统一的框架，用于评估多任务强化学习（MTRL）算法的性能，特别是在大规模并行化环境下的表现。

Abstract: Multi-task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) has emerged as a critical training
paradigm for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to a set of complex
real-world robotic tasks, which demands a generalizable and robust policy. At
the same time, \emph{massively parallelized training} has gained popularity,
not only for significantly accelerating data collection through GPU-accelerated
simulation but also for enabling diverse data collection across multiple tasks
by simulating heterogeneous scenes in parallel. However, existing MTRL research
has largely been limited to off-policy methods like SAC in the
low-parallelization regime. MTRL could capitalize on the higher asymptotic
performance of on-policy algorithms, whose batches require data from the
current policy, and as a result, take advantage of massive parallelization
offered by GPU-accelerated simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
massively parallelized $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{Bench}$mark
for robotics (MTBench), an open-sourced benchmark featuring a broad
distribution of 50 manipulation tasks and 20 locomotion tasks, implemented
using the GPU-accelerated simulator IsaacGym. MTBench also includes four base
RL algorithms combined with seven state-of-the-art MTRL algorithms and
architectures, providing a unified framework for evaluating their performance.
Our extensive experiments highlight the superior speed of evaluating MTRL
approaches using MTBench, while also uncovering unique challenges that arise
from combining massive parallelism with MTRL. Code is available at

Abstract: There has been significant advancement in legged robot's agility where they
can show impressive acrobatic maneuvers, such as parkour. These maneuvers rely
heavily on posture manipulation. To expand the stability and locomotion
plasticity, we use the multi-modal ability in our legged-aerial platform, the
Husky Beta, to perform thruster-assisted walking. This robot has thrusters on
each of its sagittal knee joints which can be used to stabilize its frontal
dynamic as it walks. In this work, we perform a simulation study of quadruped
narrow-path walking with Husky $\beta$, where the robot will utilize its
thrusters to stably walk on a narrow path. The controller is designed based on
a centroidal dynamics model with thruster and foot ground contact forces as
inputs. These inputs are regulated using a QP solver to be used in a model
predictive control framework. In addition to narrow-path walking, we also
perform a lateral push-recovery simulation to study how the thrusters can be
used to stabilize the frontal dynamics.

Abstract: Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet
fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their
configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized,
coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration.
This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized
sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core
operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are
constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial
optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an
optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated
using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution
techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and
gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is
proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved
independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed
method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures
that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion
planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

Method: 提出GSFusion，一个在线的LiDAR-Inertial-Visual建图系统，采用surfel-to-surfel约束进行全局位姿图优化，并使用像素感知的Gaussian初始化策略及有界sigmoid约束来处理稀疏数据。

Result: 在公开和自有数据集上的实验表明，GSFusion在渲染质量和建图效率上优于现有3DGS SLAM系统。

Conclusion: GSFusion系统通过创新的surfel-to-surfel约束和高效的Gaussian初始化策略，显著提升了3DGS SLAM系统的渲染质量和建图效率。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于磁感应胡须传感器的主动运动控制策略，能够有效跟踪物体并重建轮廓，具有亚毫米级的精度。

Abstract: Perception using whisker-inspired tactile sensors currently faces a major
challenge: the lack of active control in robots based on direct contact
information from the whisker. To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is
crucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an
appropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important
for localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp
surfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we
first construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact
and robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop
a method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly
extract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter
applied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy
to maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object
surface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature
and determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm
can effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter
accuracy. Finally, we validate the method in simulations and real-world
experiments where a robot arm drives the whisker sensor to follow the surfaces
of three different objects.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于原因评估的轨迹框架为自动驾驶车辆（AVs）在日常驾驶场景中实现有意义的人类控制（MHC）提供了透明且可解释的决策评估工具，是迈向实际部署的重要一步。

Abstract: A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make
appropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.
While much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as
trolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as
navigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including
legality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically
rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations
and can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper
proposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that
operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The
framework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as
quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align
with these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and
integrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the
framework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a
real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals
tensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.
The framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning
algorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in
everyday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in
real-world AV deployment.

Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles,
is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits.
While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting
control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as
policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to
physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework
with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization
that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both
simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel
Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control.
Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to
direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that
our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled
sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for autonomous mobile robots in unstructured agricultural environments, particularly for tasks like weed control, requiring efficient path planning with minimal travel distance and curvature constraints.

Method: The paper integrates a global path planner (DTSP) for minimum-length, curvature-constrained paths and a local path planner (NMPC) for control signal computation and trajectory optimization.

Result: Simulation analysis showed a 16% reduction in path length compared to decoupled methods, with the NMPC effectively steering the robot and optimizing trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed framework combining DTSP and NMPC demonstrates significant potential for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments, with smoother and shorter paths achieved.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一种轻量级、可重复的框架，用于在经济的机器人硬件上缩小仿真与现实的差距。

Abstract: Simulation-to-real transfer using domain randomization for robot control
often relies on low-gear-ratio, backdrivable actuators, but these approaches
break down when the sim-to-real gap widens. Inspired by the traditional PID
controller, we reinterpret its gains as surrogates for complex, unmodeled plant
dynamics. We then introduce a physics-guided gain regularization scheme that
measures a robot's effective proportional gains via simple real-world
experiments. Then, we penalize any deviation of a neural controller's local
input-output sensitivities from these values during training. To avoid the
overly conservative bias of naive domain randomization, we also condition the
controller on the current plant parameters. On an off-the-shelf two-wheeled
balancing robot with a 110:1 gearbox, our gain-regularized,
parameter-conditioned RNN achieves angular settling times in hardware that
closely match simulation. At the same time, a purely domain-randomized policy
exhibits persistent oscillations and a substantial sim-to-real gap. These
results demonstrate a lightweight, reproducible framework for closing
sim-to-real gaps on affordable robotic hardware.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving

high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A subject-specific calibration framework improves hand exoskeleton tracking by using redundant sensing and optimization, reducing errors across users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning inconsistencies.

Method: We propose a subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with varying hand geometries.

Result: Quantitative results from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in motion fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.

Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and
immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains
a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning
inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade
tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a
subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that
uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to
estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our
method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with
varying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically
tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more
accurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results
from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking
errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative
visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in
motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs
with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for
high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.

Motivation: 为了解决水下机器人团队在分布式SLAM中面临的声纳地图匹配效率低和依赖先验几何信息的问题，研究提出了DRACo-SLAM2框架。

Method: 提出了增量式Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set Maximization（GCM）方法，改进自Pairwise Consistent Measurement Set Maximization（PCM），以更好地处理水下扫描匹配中邻近闭环共享相似配准误差的场景。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的广泛比较分析验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DRACo-SLAM2通过引入新颖的声纳地图对象图表示和对象图匹配方法，显著提升了水下机器人团队的分布式SLAM性能，特别是在无需先验几何信息的情况下实现了高效的闭环检测。

Abstract: We present DRACo-SLAM2, a distributed SLAM framework for underwater robot
teams equipped with multibeam imaging sonar. This framework improves upon the
original DRACo-SLAM by introducing a novel representation of sonar maps as
object graphs and utilizing object graph matching to achieve time-efficient
inter-robot loop closure detection without relying on prior geometric
information. To better-accommodate the needs and characteristics of underwater
scan matching, we propose incremental Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (GCM), a modification of Pairwise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (PCM), which effectively handles scenarios where nearby
inter-robot loop closures share similar registration errors. The proposed
approach is validated through extensive comparative analyses on simulated and
real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DuLoc通过紧密耦合LiDAR-惯性里程计与离线地图定位，结合恒定速度运动模型，有效解决了长期环境变化下的定位漂移问题，并在大规模动态户外环境中表现出色。

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization serves as a critical component in autonomous
systems, yet existing approaches face persistent challenges in balancing
repeatability, accuracy, and environmental adaptability. Traditional point
cloud registration methods relying solely on offline maps often exhibit limited
robustness against long-term environmental changes, leading to localization
drift and reliability degradation in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes DuLoc, a robust and accurate localization
method that tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based
localization, incorporating a constant-velocity motion model to mitigate
outlier noise in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a LiDAR-based
localization framework that seamlessly integrates a prior global map with
dynamic real-time local maps, enabling robust localization in unbounded and
changing environments. Extensive real-world experiments in ultra unbounded port
that involve 2,856 hours of operational data across 32 Intelligent Guided
Vehicles (IGVs) are conducted and reported in this study. The results attained
demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR
localization systems in large-scale changing outdoor environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity in SLAM
applications due to its fast rendering and high-fidelity representation.
However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems have predominantly focused on indoor
environments and relied on active depth sensors, leaving a gap for large-scale
outdoor applications. We present BGS-SLAM, the first binocular 3D Gaussian
Splatting SLAM system designed for outdoor scenarios. Our approach uses only
RGB stereo pairs without requiring LiDAR or active sensors. BGS-SLAM leverages
depth estimates from pre-trained deep stereo networks to guide 3D Gaussian
optimization with a multi-loss strategy enhancing both geometric consistency
and visual quality. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that BGS-SLAM
achieves superior tracking accuracy and mapping performance compared to other
3DGS-based solutions in complex outdoor environments.

Method: 介绍了villa-X，一种新颖的ViLLA框架，改进了潜在动作的学习方式及其在VLA预训练中的整合。

Result: villa-X在SIMPLER、LIBERO等模拟环境及两种真实机器人设置（夹持器和灵巧手操作）中表现优异。

Conclusion: ViLLA范式具有显著潜力，villa-X为未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for
learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and
generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the
incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change
between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,
a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent
action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our
approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for
future research.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated
environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for
significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管触觉传感器在自然系统中能实现鲁棒的自主感知和导航，但在昆虫尺度机器人中复制这些能力仍具挑战性，主要受限于尺寸、重量和功耗的严格约束。

Method: 引入CITRAS（蟑螂启发的触觉机器人天线传感器），一种仿生、多段、柔性层压传感器，嵌入了电容式角度传感器。

Result: CITRAS实现了精确的铰链角度测量（静态弯曲最大误差0.79度，动态弯曲3.58度），并能以低误差预测距离（7.75%）、估计间隙宽度（6.73%）和区分表面纹理。

Conclusion: CITRAS的创新设计为昆虫尺度机器人提供了多功能触觉感知能力，有望在复杂、受限环境中增强自主探索、避障和环境映射。

Abstract: The American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) uses its soft antennae to
guide decision making by extracting rich tactile information from tens of
thousands of distributed mechanosensors. Although tactile sensors enable
robust, autonomous perception and navigation in natural systems, replicating
these capabilities in insect-scale robots remains challenging due to stringent
size, weight, and power constraints that limit existing sensor technologies. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CITRAS (Cockroach Inspired Tactile
Robotic Antenna Sensor), a bioinspired, multi-segmented, compliant laminate
sensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors. CITRAS is compact (73.7x15.6x2.1
mm), lightweight (491 mg), and low-power (32 mW), enabling seamless integration
with miniature robotic platforms. The segmented compliant structure passively
bends in response to environmental stimuli, achieving accurate hinge angle
measurements with maximum errors of just 0.79 degree (quasistatic bending) and
3.58 degree (dynamic bending). Experimental evaluations demonstrate CITRAS'
multifunctional tactile perception capabilities: predicting base-to-tip
distances with 7.75 % error, estimating environmental gap widths with 6.73 %
error, and distinguishing surface textures through differential sensor
response. The future integration of this bioinspired tactile antenna in
insect-scale robots addresses critical sensing gaps, promising enhanced
autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in
complex, confined environments.

Abstract: Achieving robust cognitive autonomy in robots navigating complex,
unpredictable environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. This
paper presents Underwater Robot Self-Organizing Autonomy (UROSA), a
groundbreaking architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI
agents integrated within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework to
enable advanced cognitive capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. UROSA
decentralises cognition into specialised AI agents responsible for multimodal

traditional rule-based architectures in handling unforeseen scenarios,
environmental uncertainties, and novel mission objectives. This work not only
advances underwater autonomy but also establishes a scalable, safe, and
versatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse
array of real-world applications.
