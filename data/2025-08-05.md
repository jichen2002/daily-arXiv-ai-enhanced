Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest

### [3] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoneyImage是一种新颖的图像数据集所有权验证方法，通过在困难样本中嵌入不可察觉的痕迹，实现高验证准确性且不影响数据完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像数据集常包含敏感或专有内容，现有解决方案（如后门水印和成员推断）在验证有效性和数据完整性保护之间存在固有折衷。

Method: HoneyImage通过选择性修改少量困难样本以嵌入不可察觉但可验证的痕迹，实现了可靠的所有权验证，同时保持数据集完整性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和多种模型架构上的广泛实验表明，HoneyImage在保持不可察觉性的同时，始终实现强验证准确性，对下游性能影响最小。

Conclusion: HoneyImage方法为数据所有者提供了一种实用的机制来保护有价值的图像数据集的所有权，鼓励安全共享并释放数据驱动AI的全部变革潜力。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg是一种新型的一阶段扩散框架，通过联合生成微结构图像和分割掩码，显著提升分割精度，尤其在少数类别中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在金相显微组织分割中的有效性常受限于缺乏人工标注的相位掩码，特别是对于金属合金中罕见或组成复杂的形态。

Method: PF-DiffSeg是一种基于相位分数控制的一阶段去噪扩散框架，通过联合合成微结构图像及其对应的分割掩码来提升分割准确性。模型通过全局相位分数向量进行条件化，增强真实数据分布并强调少数类别。

Result: 在MetalDAM基准测试中，PF-DiffSeg的合成增强方法显著提升了分割精度，尤其在少数类别中表现优于标准增强策略和两阶段掩码引导扩散及GAN基线方法，同时减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg通过将生成和条件整合到一个统一的框架中，为金相应用中的数据增强提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提高了分割精度，尤其是在少数类别中。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频帧预测模型仍有改进空间，AI尤其是深度学习在计算机视觉领域具有显著潜力。

Method: 评估了结合自编码器特征提取能力和RNN、3D CNN等时序建模的混合深度学习方法。

Result: SSIM指标从0.69提升至0.82，表明3D CNN和ConvLSTM的混合模型最有效，真实灰度视频最易预测。

Conclusion: 混合模型结合3D CNN和ConvLSTM在视频帧预测中表现最佳，尤其是处理真实世界的灰度视频。

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [6] [TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC是一种自监督预训练框架，专为学习事件的时空信息设计，通过掩码图像建模和伪灰度视频重建，显著提升了循环模型在事件感知任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法主要模仿RGB图像的方法，忽略了事件的时间信息，无法有效预训练循环模型。TESPEC旨在填补这一空白，专门为学习时空信息设计。

Method: TESPEC采用掩码图像建模范式，设计了新的重建目标，通过将事件累积为伪灰度视频来捕获高级语义信息，减少传感器噪声和运动模糊的影响。

Result: 实验表明，TESPEC在下游任务中取得了最先进的成果，包括目标检测、语义分割和单目深度估计。

Conclusion: TESPEC通过自监督预训练框架，成功提升了循环模型在事件感知任务中的表现，特别是在需要长期时间信息的任务上，如下游的目标检测、语义分割和单目深度估计。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

TL;DR: CCRA通过LPWCA和PAI协调多种注意力机制，提升VLMs性能，实现SOTA结果并增强可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Language Models (VLMs)在跨模态嵌入学习中协调多样化注意力机制时的挑战，如注意力不匹配和性能不佳。

Method: 提出了Consistent Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA)，包括Layer-Patch-wise Cross Attention (LPWCA)和Progressive Attention Integration (PAI)，以联合加权补丁和层嵌入捕获细粒度区域-语义相关性，并系统协调多种注意力机制。

Result: CCRA显著提升了模型性能，实现了最先进的结果，并增强了注意力模式的可解释性。

Conclusion: CCRA-enhanced LLaVA-v1.5-7B模型在十个多样化的视觉语言基准测试中表现最佳，仅增加3.55M参数即超越所有基线方法，同时通过更区域聚焦和语义对齐的注意力模式提供增强的可解释性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Conclusion: 结合自动生成的标签和少量手动标注数据集，可以加速深度神经网络适应新用例（如从跑步机过渡到自行车）。

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROVI是一个高质量合成数据集，通过创新重标注策略和VLM+LLM技术提升文本到图像生成性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有检测数据集在图像质量、分辨率和类别覆盖上的不足，ROVI旨在提供更高质量的合成数据集。

Method: 通过重新标注策略和结合VLM与LLM的技术，生成全面的视觉描述并提取潜在类别列表，供OVDs检测。

Result: ROVI在图像质量和分辨率上优于现有数据集，类别数量多两个数量级，且基于ROVI训练的GLIGEN模型在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ROVI数据集及其可复现的流程已开源，为实例接地文本到图像生成领域提供了高质量的资源。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at

*Byron Dowling,Jozef Probcin,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSIGHT uses eye-tracking data to classify human expertise, achieving AUROC scores of 0.751 (5s) and 0.8306 (30s), enabling dynamic human-AI collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether machines can automatically classify human expertise based on eye-tracking features, particularly in dynamic human-AI collaboration scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes AutoSIGHT, an ensemble-based system that classifies expertise using features extracted from eye-tracking data during visual tasks.

Result: AutoSIGHT achieves AUROC scores of 0.751 (5-second window) and 0.8306 (30-second window), indicating viable expertise detection with improved performance over longer evaluation windows.

Conclusion: AutoSIGHT demonstrates the feasibility of automatically assessing human expertise using eye-tracking data, with potential applications in dynamic human-AI collaboration setups.

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts
solving iris PAD visual task.

TL;DR: 增量式SfM通过逐步整合新视图，适用于稀疏或部分重叠的数据集，实验证明其在视觉结构化环境中进行3D重建的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局SfM技术依赖完整的图像连接性，对噪声或缺失数据敏感，而增量式SfM提供了更灵活的替代方案，适用于稀疏或部分重叠的数据集。

Method: 本文详细实现了增量式SfM流程，重点关注几何估计的一致性和通过光束法平差进行迭代优化的效果。

Result: 使用真实数据集验证了方法的有效性，并通过重投影误差和相机轨迹一致性评估了重建质量。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM是一种在视觉结构化环境中进行稀疏3D重建的可靠方法。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于图结构的新方法来处理3D CT扫描的多标签分类问题，该方法在保持竞争力的同时展现了良好的跨数据集泛化能力和对z轴平移的鲁棒性。消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的规避框架，通过选择性转移任务导向知识，显著提升了针对数据集所有权验证（DOV）的规避效果，揭示了当前DOV方法的关键漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代过参数化的深度模型高度依赖数据，但许多数据集是专有的或包含敏感信息，使得无限制的模型训练存在问题。在开放世界中，数据盗窃无法完全防止，数据集所有权验证（DOV）成为保护版权的一种有前景的方法。然而，先前的研究依赖于过于简化的规避攻击进行评估，导致了虚假的安全感。

Method: 提出了一个统一的规避框架，利用教师模型从版权数据集中学习，并通过OOD数据集作为中介将任务相关但标识符无关的领域知识转移到替代学生模型中。利用视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，从OOD图库集中筛选最具信息性和可靠性的子集作为最终转移集，并选择性转移任务导向知识，以在泛化性和规避效果之间取得更好平衡。

Result: 实验覆盖了11种DOV方法的多样化数据集，表明该方法能同时消除所有版权标识符，并在泛化性和有效性上显著优于九种最先进的规避攻击，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了当前数据集所有权验证（DOV）方法的关键漏洞，强调了需要长期发展以提升实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升小行星探索和自主航天器导航的效率和准确性。

Method: 使用2D感知（图像质量）和3D几何（形状准确性）指标，对Hunyuan-3D、Trellis-3D和Ouroboros-3D三种模型在自定义航天器和小行星数据集上进行了基准测试。

Result: 模型性能依赖于领域：复杂航天器的图像质量更高，而简单形状的小行星的几何重建更准确。Hunyuan-3D在航天器上获得最佳感知分数，在小行星上获得最佳几何精度。

Conclusion: DreamSat-2.0的引入显著提升了小行星探索和自主航天器导航的能力，通过系统分析三种最先进的3D重建模型，确立了新的性能基准。

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

*Ryan Rabinowitz,Steve Cruz,Walter Scheirer,Terrance E. Boult*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COSTARR利用衰减特征提升开放集识别性能，在多种架构上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法依赖熟悉特征假设，忽略了衰减信息的作用。本文提出衰减假设，认为小权重在训练中衰减的特征对区分已知和未知类别具有重要作用。

Method: 提出COSTARR方法，结合熟悉特征的缺失和陌生特征的缺乏，利用预衰减和后衰减的Hadamard乘积特征进行开放集识别。

Result: COSTARR在多种预训练架构（如ViTs、ConvNeXts和ResNet）上显著优于现有方法，特别是在大规模数据集（如ImageNet2012-1K和NINCO等）上表现优异。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过结合熟悉特征的缺失和陌生特征的缺乏，显著提升了开放集识别的性能，并在多种预训练架构上展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

TL;DR: Trans-Adapter 是一种即插即用适配器，使扩散模型能直接修复透明图像，解决了传统方法的透明一致性和边缘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅支持 RGB 图像，传统 RGBA 修复流程存在透明一致性差和边缘锯齿问题，需直接支持透明图像修复。

Method: 提出了 Trans-Adapter，一个支持扩散式修复模型直接处理 RGBA 图像的适配器，并可无缝集成 ControlNet 实现可控编辑。

Result: 通过 LayerBench 实验验证了 Trans-Adapter 的有效性，并提出了新的透明度边缘质量评估指标。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter 是一种创新的即插即用适配器，能够直接处理透明图像，解决了传统方法中透明一致性和边缘锯齿问题，并通过 LayerBench 和新的评估指标验证了其有效性。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: MASIV是一个基于视觉的材料无关系统识别框架，通过神经本构模型和密集几何引导，解决了传统方法依赖材料先验的问题，性能领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的材料先验，无法处理未知材料，MASIV旨在解决这一问题，实现材料无关的系统识别。

Method: MASIV采用可学习的神经本构模型，结合密集几何引导（通过重建连续粒子轨迹），克服了传统方法依赖预定义材料先验的限制。

Result: MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MASIV通过引入可学习的神经本构模型和密集几何引导，成功实现了材料无关的系统识别，显著提升了几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Motivation: 探索并比较不同策略（SFT、RL、CoT）在广泛图像编辑任务中的性能提升，以找到一个高效且一致的框架。

Method: 研究采用了三种策略：监督微调（SFT）、强化学习（RL）和思维链（CoT）推理，并在一个统一的自回归多模态模型框架下进行实验，该模型以统一的方式处理文本和视觉标记。

Result: 研究发现，结合强化学习和大规模多模态LLM验证器的策略最为有效，由此开发了EARL模型，该模型在多样化编辑任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: EARL（Editing with Autoregression and RL）通过结合自回归和强化学习，在图像编辑任务中表现出色，尽管训练数据较少，但仍能媲美强基线模型，推动了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑领域的进展。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注第三人称运动合成，但在真实自我中心场景中，由于视野有限、频繁遮挡和动态相机，其效果受限。

Method: 提出 UniEgoMotion，一种统一的基于运动扩散的条件模型，采用新颖的头中心运动表示，支持从第一人称视觉输入进行运动重建、预测和生成。

Result: UniEgoMotion 在自我中心运动重建中表现优异，并首次实现从单张自我中心图像生成运动。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion 在自我中心运动重建和生成方面实现了最先进的性能，并为自我中心运动建模设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

Motivation: 开发一种领域无关的半监督异常检测框架，以解决大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡等挑战，特别针对脑MRI数据。

Method: 研究采用公开的脑MRI数据集（IXI和BraTS 2021）进行训练和测试，预处理包括归一化、去颅骨和配准。通过整合DRL与特征表示，解决了标签稀缺、大规模数据和过拟合问题。实验基于AUROC和Dice分数等指标评估性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种领域无关的半监督异常检测框架，结合深度强化学习（DRL），在脑MRI数据集和工业数据集上均表现出色，展示了其鲁棒性、泛化能力和高效性，具有实际临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法在极端压缩下存在性能与保真度的权衡问题，且忽视了色彩作为信息载体和语义单元的双重作用。

Method: 提出DC3框架，结合校准选择策略和潜扩散模型增强图像色彩多样性。

Result: DC3在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且首次利用预训练扩散模型微调压缩数据集。

Conclusion: DC3框架通过颜色补偿策略显著提升了数据集压缩的性能和保真度，且在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

TL;DR: PSA框架通过个性化用户档案调整扩散模型行为，提升安全内容控制效果，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的安全机制缺乏对用户个性化需求的考虑，无法适应不同用户的安全边界。

Method: 提出Personalized Safety Alignment（PSA）框架，通过用户个性化档案和交叉注意力机制调整扩散模型行为。

Result: PSA在有害内容抑制和用户偏好对齐方面表现优于现有方法，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA框架通过整合个性化用户偏好，显著提升了生成模型在安全内容控制方面的表现，且不影响图像质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有图像分割方法在个性化和精度上的不足，提出了结合语言提示和窗口细化的可控分割框架。

Method: LawDIS将图像分割任务重新定义为潜在扩散模型中的图像条件掩码生成任务，结合语言控制和窗口细化策略，实现了宏微观控制。

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中，LawDIS显著优于11种先进方法，特别是在LS和WR策略结合时，Fβω指标提升了4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架通过语言-窗口控制策略，显著提升了图像分割的准确性和个性化能力，在DIS5K基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于复杂的视觉外观和有限的语义先验，场景文本识别（STR）仍是一个具有挑战性的任务。TEACH旨在通过一种无需外部预训练且不增加推理开销的新训练范式，提升识别准确率。

Method: TEACH通过将真实文本作为辅助输入注入模型，并在训练过程中逐步减少其影响，结合目标标签嵌入空间和损失感知掩码，模拟了从标签依赖学习到完全视觉识别的课程学习过程。

Result: 实验表明，采用TEACH训练的模型在多个基准测试中均取得了更高的准确率，尤其是在挑战性条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: TEACH训练范式在多个公开基准测试中表现出色，显著提升了场景文本识别的准确率，特别是在复杂条件下，验证了其鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析了现有最先进方法的计算瓶颈，特别是处理大量轨迹时Transformer迭代跟踪的高成本和相关性特征计算的高开销。

Method: 引入了一个从粗到精的策略，通过逐步扩展跟踪轨迹集，并使用可学习的插值模块初始化新轨迹。同时，提出了一种优化方法，显著降低了相关性特征计算的成本。

Result: 实现了5-100倍的加速，同时保持了最先进的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在保持最先进跟踪精度的同时，实现了5-100倍的速度提升。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏多视角图像下3D高斯喷绘的效率问题，无需真实姿态即可训练和推理。

Method: 采用共享特征提取主干，通过单次前馈步骤从无姿态输入中预测3D高斯原语和相机姿态，并集成渲染损失和重投影损失以增强几何约束。

Conclusion: SPFSplat在无需姿态监督的情况下，实现了新颖视角合成的领先性能，并在相对姿态估计中超越现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合affordance-aware 3D表示和阶段式推理的新方法，有效解决了3D affordance grounding和分类任务中的依赖关系和尺度问题，实验验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Embodied AI中通过观察学习物体操纵的核心问题，特别是3D affordance grounding和affordance classification任务之间的依赖关系建模不足，以及现有方法无法预测完整affordance区域和适应不同尺度的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的方法，学习affordance-aware的3D表示，并采用阶段式推理策略，利用grounding和分类任务之间的依赖关系。具体包括跨模态3D表示的高效融合和多尺度几何特征传播，以及简单的两阶段预测机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在affordance grounding和分类任务上均取得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 实验证明，该方法在3D affordance grounding和affordance classification任务上均表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Conclusion: 论文提出了GroundingOcc模型和一个针对3D占用接地的新基准，显著提升了传统视觉接地任务在精细物体表示方面的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

Motivation: 现有的Mamba架构在视觉路面分类任务中因缺乏对路面局部纹理的有效提取而难以达到最佳性能。本文首次探索视觉Mamba架构在路面分类任务中的潜力，并提出一种有效结合局部和全局感知的方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为RoadMamba的方法，利用Dual State Space Model (DualSSM)提取路面的全局语义和局部纹理，并通过Dual Attention Fusion (DAF)解码和融合双重特征。此外，还引入了双重辅助损失来明确约束双重分支。

Result: RoadMamba在包含100万样本的大规模路面分类数据集实验中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba通过结合局部和全局感知，在路面分类任务中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的安全性和驾驶舒适性。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

TL;DR: StyDeco通过无监督学习解决了文本驱动风格转换中的语义鸿沟问题，采用PGD和CSD方法，显著提升风格化效果并支持去风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动风格转换方法将文本描述视为统一指导，忽略了文本非空间性与视觉风格空间属性之间的语义鸿沟，导致风格化过程中语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: 框架首先采用Prior-Guided Data Distillation（PGD）策略无监督地提取风格知识，随后通过Contrastive Semantic Decoupling（CSD）任务特定目标调整文本编码器，实现在语义空间中的两类别聚类。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试上的广泛实验表明，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StyDeco框架通过无监督学习解决了文本驱动风格转换中的语义鸿沟问题，显著提升了风格保真度和结构保留能力，并支持独特的去风格化过程，展示了其可扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

Motivation: 由于平面图包含许多重复结构，导致定位模糊，现有方法忽略了视觉图像提供的更丰富的上下文信息。

Method: 提出了一种无监督学习技术，结合聚类约束在自收集的无标签房间图像上预训练房间判别器，以提取隐藏的房间类型信息。

Result: 在两个标准视觉FLoc基准测试中，该方法表现出色，显著提升了定位的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 通过注入场景上下文信息，该方法在视觉平面定位（FLoc）中显著提高了鲁棒性和准确性，超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有3D头部虚拟形象重建方法依赖面部标志点跟踪的FLAME网格和高斯渲染，但网格与目标图像的错位导致渲染质量下降和细节丢失。

Method: MoGaFace框架包含Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry模块和Latent Texture Attention机制，前者通过动量更新表达式库和表情感知校正确保几何一致性，后者将多视角特征编码为头部感知表示以实现纹理优化。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace实现了高保真头部虚拟形象重建，并显著提升了新视角合成质量。

Conclusion: MoGaFace通过连续优化面部几何和纹理属性，显著提高了3D头部虚拟形象的重建质量和新视角合成效果，即使在网格初始化不准确和无约束的现实场景下也表现优异。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

TL;DR: ENN是一种新型神经网络架构，通过正交特征基重新参数化权重，解决了DNN权重结构的无序问题，显著提升了性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNN）的梯度优化过程常因产生无序的权重结构而损害特征清晰度并降低学习动态，ENN旨在解决这一根本性表示缺陷。

Method: ENN通过层共享、学习的正交特征基重新参数化每层的权重，强制实现去相关且对齐良好的权重动态，而非通过正则化。

Result: ENN在大型图像分类基准（如ImageNet）上持续优于现有方法，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中创下新基准。其无反向传播的变体ENN-ℓ不仅实现了超过2倍的训练加速，还超越了端到端反向传播的准确性。

Conclusion: ENN提出了一种新的架构范式，直接解决了反向传播（BP）在表示上的缺陷，从而提升了性能并实现了更高效、可并行化的训练机制。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training

decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

TL;DR: MCP and MCP++ enhance test-time adaptation by using multi-cache integration and cross-modal alignment, outperforming existing methods in 15 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on low-entropy samples, which may be unreliable under distribution shifts, leading to non-compact intra-class distributions. This study aims to improve performance by leveraging intra-class compactness.

Method: The study introduces Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) with three caches: entropy cache for initialization, align cache for intra-class compactness, and negative cache for prediction calibration. MCP++ extends this with cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning.

Result: Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks show that MCP and MCP++ outperform existing methods, achieving superior generalization performance.

Conclusion: The proposed MCP and MCP++ frameworks achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance by addressing the limitations of existing cache-enhanced TTA methods through multi-cache integration and cross-modal prototype alignment.

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Conclusion: 提出的多视图开放集学习框架通过模糊不确定性校准和视图去偏，显著提升了未知类别的识别能力，同时保持了强大的封闭集性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

TL;DR: ACCM通过自适应内容补偿方法减少LVLMs的计算成本，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的高计算成本限制了其广泛应用，主要源于视觉输入序列的高token数量。现有方法在高剪枝率下性能下降严重。

Method: ACCM包含轻量级caption模型和选择器，通过用户指令生成问题相关描述并选择最合适的caption。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM在较低FLOPs下显著优于现有方法（例如，FLOPs减少6.5%时性能提升20.6%）。

Conclusion: ACCM通过自适应内容补偿方法有效缓解了视觉信息损失问题，显著提升了性能同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

Conclusion: NS-Net 通过 NULL-Space 投影和对比学习，显著提升了 AI 生成图像检测的泛化能力，在 40 种生成模型的开放世界基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image

Conclusion: DisFaceRep框架通过显式和隐式机制有效解决了WSFP任务中的组件共现问题，显著优于现有弱监督方法。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be
released at

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常冻结编码器，导致任务无关表示与特定聚类任务需求不匹配，限制了性能。本文旨在打破这一限制。

Method: 框架分为两个阶段：首先通过跨模态语义一致性训练轻量级聚类头，然后通过自我增强微调策略联合优化视觉编码器和聚类头。

Result: 在六个主流数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有深度聚类方法，ViT-B/32模型甚至超越了基于更大ViT-L/14的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的自增强框架通过跨模态语义一致性和自我增强微调策略，显著提升了图像聚类的性能，超越了现有深度聚类方法。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

TL;DR: STDNet通过空间和时间差异分支解决深度超分辨率的长尾分布问题，提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度超分辨率中存在明显的长尾分布问题，尤其在空间非平滑区域和时间变化区域，影响了重建质量。

Method: 提出了SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet)，包含空间差异分支和时间差异分支。空间差异分支通过动态对齐RGB特征与学习到的空间差异表示来校准深度；时间差异分支则优先传播相邻RGB和深度帧的时变信息以实现精确运动补偿。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，STDNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet通过其独特的空间和时间差异分支有效解决了深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 解决扩散生成模型在数据集蒸馏中因多样性不足导致的信息冗余问题。

Method: 提出Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS)，将蒸馏数据集分为多个课程，通过对抗性损失引导扩散采样过程，减少信息冗余并提升多样性。

Result: 在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上分别取得4.1%和2.1%的性能提升。

Conclusion: ACS通过对抗性引导的课程采样方法，显著提高了数据集蒸馏的多样性和效率，在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上分别实现了4.1%和2.1%的性能提升。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Result: SGCap在零样本视频描述任务中表现优异，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: SGCap方法在多个基准测试中显著优于之前的零样本替代方案，甚至达到了与全监督方法相竞争的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

TL;DR: PromptSafe是一个门控提示调优框架，通过文本训练和自适应防御强度，有效减少T2I模型生成NSFW内容，同时保持良性生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型易生成NSFW内容，且现有防御方法依赖大规模图像-文本数据集，计算成本高、适应性差，无法满足多样化的安全需求。

Method: 提出PromptSafe框架，通过LLM重写不安全提示为语义对齐的安全替代品，构建文本训练语料库，并优化通用软提示以在扩散去噪过程中排斥不安全内容。引入门控机制根据提示毒性自适应调整防御强度。

Result: PromptSafe在多个基准和T2I模型上实现了最低的不安全生成率（2.36%），同时保持了高良性生成质量，展现出对未见有害类别的强泛化能力和跨模型架构的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PromptSafe 通过结合轻量级文本监督软嵌入和推理时门控控制网络，有效解决了T2I模型生成NSFW内容的问题，实现了最低的不安全生成率（2.36%），同时保持了高良性生成质量。其泛化能力和鲁棒性进一步证明了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法在KITTI Stereo基准测试中实现了无监督立体匹配方法中最先进的匹配精度。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Motivation: 受人类观察目标行为的启发，旨在解决现有方法在处理微小、模糊目标时的不足。

Method: 提出了一个并行且统一的框架 CSINet，包含跨视图窗口注意力模块（CVWin）和协作扩张注意力增强解码器（CDAD），用于补充全局和局部语义信息。

Result: CSINet 显著提升了性能，同时保持了满意的速度。

Conclusion: CSINet 通过跨视图语义交互网络有效解决了现有方法在处理微小、模糊目标时的局限性，显著提升了性能并保持了满意的速度。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对标记皮肤病数据集的依赖，提供一种可扩展且灵活的诊断支持工具。

Method: 该方法通过生成编辑合成无红斑的参考图像，并准确对齐原始图像，结合颜色空间分析和最小用户干预来识别红斑区域。

Result: 初步定性实验中，该框架成功隔离了多种情况下的面部红斑，性能优于基线阈值技术。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了结合生成扩散模型和统计颜色分割在计算机辅助皮肤病学中的潜力，实现了无需先验训练数据的高效红斑检测。

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

*Shitian Yang,Deyu Li,Xiaoke Jiang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DRot是一种几何一致的数据增强方法，显著提升单目3D检测性能，且无需依赖场景深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-based 3D任务中标注稀缺、昂贵且数据增强工具不足的问题，尤其是传统图像变换（如调整大小和旋转）会破坏几何一致性的挑战。

Method: 提出3DRot方法，通过旋转和镜像图像并同步更新RGB图像、相机内参、物体姿态和3D标注，以保持投影几何一致性。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上，3DRot将IoU3D从43.21提升至44.51，旋转误差（ROT）从22.91°降至20.93°，mAP0.5从35.70提升至38.11。

Conclusion: 3DRot是一种即插即用的数据增强方法，通过相机空间变换实现几何一致性旋转和反射，显著提升了单目3D检测任务的性能，并具有广泛适用于其他3D任务的潜力。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的广泛使用导致个人艺术作品被未经授权使用，现有保护方法（如扰动、水印等）防御能力有限。

Method: 采用语义自重构过程增强风格表达，自适应融合多层图像特征编码为紧凑风格指纹，并将艺术家风格建模为特征空间中的最小包围超球边界。

Result: 在单样本验证任务中表现优异，并通过在线平台验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel通过验证艺术家作品中的固有风格指纹，提供了一种有效的版权保护方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为TOPICS+的增强版方法，专门用于手术场景的鲁棒分割，通过引入Dice损失、分层伪标签和定制化的标签分类法，显著提升了模型在动态手术环境中的表现。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过引入预训练视觉语言模型的辅助语义监督，显著提升了弱监督图像伪造定位的性能，实现了在检测和定位准确率上的最先进表现。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: RandSF.Q通过引入随机槽-特征对和学习过渡动力学，显著提升了视频OCL方法的性能，在对象发现和动态建模等下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in
humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning
approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于事件的单次积分（ESI）方法，用于高效重建强度图像，显著提升了无人机在极端光照条件下的机载视觉跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有宽动态范围、高时间分辨率和抗运动模糊等优势，但如何从异步事件流中提取有效信息并实现机载应用是关键挑战。

Method: ESI通过单次积分事件流结合增强衰减算法重建强度图像。

Result: ESI在运行时效率、重建质量和帧率方面显著优于现有算法，适合机载实现（如无人机视觉跟踪）。

Conclusion: ESI方法在无人机机载视觉跟踪中表现出色，尤其在极低光照条件下（2-10lux），而其他算法因帧率不足、图像质量差或实时性能受限而失败。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出轻量级SoftMax注意力机制FWA和混合骨干网络LOLViT，显著提升计算效率和模型性能，在多项视觉任务中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 当前轻量级混合骨干网络在计算效率上存在卷积神经网络（CNNs）与注意力机制之间的不平衡，且现有方法在长序列建模和计算饱和问题上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种名为FWA的轻量级SoftMax注意力机制，通过窗口聚合生成少量关键序列进行注意力计算，并使用ReLU模拟SoftMax操作。结合GhostNet，设计了轻量级混合骨干网络LOLViT。

Result: LOLViT在ImageNet 1K分类、COCO 2017检测和BDD100K分割任务中，推理速度和准确性均优于同级CNN模型，LOLViT-X的推理速度是MobileViT-X的5倍。

Conclusion: LOLViT通过自适应特征图大小的轻量级SoftMax注意力机制（FWA）和全局-局部特征融合机制，显著提升了推理速度和模型准确性，尤其在分类、检测和分割任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

TL;DR: 提出了一种直接从卫星图像学习纹理数字地形图的神经方法（NTM），避免了繁琐的MVS流程，测试结果显示其精度接近图像分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通过多视角立体（MVS）流程生成数字地形图（DTM）的方法繁琐且需要大量手动预处理，限制了其在日益复杂的机器人探索任务中的应用。

Method: 通过将神经体积渲染技术应用于卫星图像，直接从图像学习纹理数字地形图（NTM），无需依赖深度或其他结构先验。

Result: 在合成和真实卫星数据（地球和火星）上测试，覆盖面积约100平方公里，地形预测精度接近图像分辨率。

Conclusion: 该方法在合成和真实卫星数据上均表现出色，地形预测精度接近卫星图像分辨率，即使在相机参数不完美的情况下也是如此。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在手持智能手机和非静态车载摄像头拍摄的视频中进行车牌和车型识别的潜力，展示了其在运动交通视频分析中的高效性和可扩展性。


<details>

Motivation: 手持智能手机或非静态车载摄像头拍摄的视频中，传统ALPR解决方案在频繁相机运动、不同视角、遮挡和未知道路几何形状等条件下表现不佳。

Method: 提出的车牌识别流程筛选出清晰的帧，然后向VLM发送多模态提示，采用多种提示策略。车型识别流程使用相同的VLM，但修改了提示并加入可选的自反思模块。自反思模块将查询图像与134类数据集中的参考图像对比，纠正不匹配。

Conclusion: VLMs提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案，适用于可扩展的运动中交通视频分析。

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

Method: MonoDream采用轻量级VLA框架，学习统一的导航表示（UNR），并通过Latent Panoramic Dreaming（LPD）任务监督UNR，预测当前和未来步骤的全景RGB和深度观测的潜在特征。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中，MonoDream显著提升了单目导航性能，并缩小了与全景RGB-D方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream通过其轻量级的VLA框架和UNR表示，显著提升了单目视觉导航的性能，并缩小了与基于全景RGB-D方法的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Motivation: 现有方法主要在空间域进行增强，难以有效恢复RAW图像中因宽动态范围和线性响应而被抑制的关键对象细节。

Method: 提出了Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection Enhancer (SFAE)框架，包括频率带的“空间化”、跨域融合注意力模块以及自适应非线性调整。

Result: SFAE框架在频率域中分离特征（如对象轮廓和纹理），通过空间和频率表示的结合，显著提升了对象检测的准确性。

Conclusion: SFAE框架通过结合空间和频率表示，有效提升了RAW图像中的对象检测性能，特别是在恢复被抑制的细节方面表现突出。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson

propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

TL;DR: Can3Tok是首个3D场景级VAE，解决了场景级生成的潜在表示学习挑战，并展示了在图像到3DGS和文本到3DGS生成中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D生成主要局限于对象级，而场景级生成由于缺乏可扩展的潜在表示学习模型，尤其是面对无界和尺度不一致的3D场景时，挑战巨大。

Method: 提出了Can3Tok，一种3D场景级变分自编码器（VAE），能够将大量高斯基元编码为低维潜在嵌入，并设计了一个通用管道处理3D场景数据。

Result: 在DL3DV-10K数据集上验证，Can3Tok能成功泛化到新场景，而其他方法无法收敛且无泛化能力。

Conclusion: Can3Tok成功解决了3D场景级生成中的潜在表示学习挑战，并通过应用展示了其在下游生成任务中的能力。

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run

Conclusion: E-VRAG框架在视频理解任务中显著提高了效率和准确性，无需额外训练即可实现约70%的计算成本降低和更高的准确率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the

Motivation: Conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense, stateless scans, leading to sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption, which limits their practicality on resource-constrained platforms.

Method: The approach uses a lightweight predictor network to distill historical spatial and temporal contexts into query embeddings, guiding a differentiable Mask Generator network with Gumbel-Softmax sampling to identify critical ROIs for adaptive LiDAR scanning.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks show the method reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or superior 3D object detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive scanning framework effectively reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining or improving 3D object detection performance, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

Motivation: 当前的时间动作定位方法依赖标注的动作和对象类别，导致领域偏差和部署效率低下。现有的零-shot方法存在粗粒度估计和开环流程的问题，限制了时间交互定位性能的提升。

Method: EgoLoc 提出了一种自适应的采样策略，结合2D和3D观察数据，通过3D手部速度直接采样高质量初始猜测，并通过视觉和动态线索的闭环反馈进一步优化定位结果。

Result: EgoLoc 在时间交互定位任务中实现了更高的推理准确性和效率。

Conclusion: EgoLoc 在公开数据集和新提出的基准测试中表现优于现有基线，证明了其在第一人称视频中时间交互定位的优越性。

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the
foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and
human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods
typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for
optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.
Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization
(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained
estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for
temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a
novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp
actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a
self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM
reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples
high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps
of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and
efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and
dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive
experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark
demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for
egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our
code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Result: 实验证明LetheViT在随机数据遗忘场景中表现优异，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LetheViT通过对比性遗忘方法，有效解决了Vision Transformers在隐私法规下的数据遗忘问题，平衡了隐私合规性与模型效能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

Motivation: 现有图像处理方法在深度学习框架中缺乏对拓扑结构的敏感性，需要一种能够捕捉图像局部拓扑信息的新表示方法。

Method: 利用持久同调（PH）编码图像补丁的几何和拓扑特征，生成多视角TopoImages并与原始图像融合用于深度学习分类。

Result: 生成的TopoImages提供了数据分析的新视角，多视角TopoImages与原始图像融合后显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: TopoImages方法在三个公共医学图像分类数据集上显著提高了分类准确率，超越了现有最佳方法。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探索CLIP中丰富的文本语义先验在解决连续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境中的潜力，并解决现有方法在知识转移和分类器设计中的不足。

Method: 提出了Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT)模块和Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype Refinement (SE-VPR)模块，分别用于语义感知的知识转移和视觉原型的语义增强。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验验证了SECA框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA框架通过利用文本先验的防遗忘和结构化特性，成功地在连续学习中实现了语义感知的知识转移和视觉分类器的语义结构强化，解决了稳定性与可塑性之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

Motivation: 传统领域泛化（DG）假设目标域在训练期间不可访问，但VFMs的出现使得这一假设变得过时。因此，需要一种更适应当前研究和应用需求的新方法。

Method: 提出了动态提示微调方法，结合动态类感知提示器和提示引导的特征聚焦器，以优化VFM在特定任务中的表现。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验证明了SPL方法的有效性，尤其是在广义分割任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Set Pivot Learning (SPL) 作为一种新的领域迁移任务定义，基于视觉基础模型（VFMs），通过动态适应性和VFM中心调优，显著提升了模型在目标场景中的性能，特别是在广义分割任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在连续时间动态学习和随机运动序列预测方面存在挑战，易忽略复杂运动的灵活性并陷入模式崩溃。

Method: 提出STCN方法，分为两阶段：1) 时空连续网络生成平滑运动序列；2) 利用锚点集学习GMM分布，并采样多序列以减少类内差异。

Result: STCN在多样性和准确性上表现优异。

Conclusion: STCN模型在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上表现出色，在多样性和准确性方面均取得竞争性结果。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

TL;DR: Pr^2R通过压缩信息和双重对齐策略，在保护隐私的同时提升终身行人重识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决终身行人重识别（LReID）中数据隐私问题和知识遗忘问题，提出一种无需存储原始样本的隐私保护重放方法。

Method: 提出Pr^2R方法，通过将多个真实图像的特征蒸馏到单个图像中，生成具有代表性的压缩样本，同时在重放阶段进行风格对齐和域适应。

Result: Pr^2R在多个基准测试中表现优异，连续任务的准确率比现有技术高4%，比其他基于重放的方法高6%。

Conclusion: Pr^2R方法通过将信息压缩到像素空间并在重放阶段进行双重对齐，显著提高了重放效果，同时保护了数据隐私。实验证明，该方法在连续任务上的准确率优于现有技术和其他基于重放的方法。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

TL;DR: SNARM是一种新型工业异常检测框架，通过自我参考学习和动态Mamba模块提升性能，实验证明其在多个数据集上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖于正常训练数据的预训练特征，SNARM提出通过"自我参考学习"在测试图像中增强异常检测能力。

Method: SNARM通过动态比较测试图像块与自适应选择的内部参考块，计算"inter-residuals"和"intra-residuals"特征，并将这些特征输入到多头的Mamba模块中，动态聚焦于异常区域。

Result: SNARM在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了所有指标。

Conclusion: SNARM框架在MVTec AD、MVTec 3D和VisA基准测试中表现出色，实现了所有指标的最先进性能，包括Image-AUROC、Pixel-AURC、PRO和AP。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Motivation: 解决不同模态间的特征差异，提升跨模态融合效果，实现高效的多模态跟踪。

Method: DMTrack包含两个模块：时空模态适配器（STMA）和渐进模态互补适配器（PMCA）。STMA通过自提示调整冻结主干的时空特征，PMCA通过浅层和深层适配器逐步促进跨模态提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器架构（STMA和PMCA）在时空多模态跟踪中表现出色，仅需0.93M可训练参数即可实现先进性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

Motivation: 解决多模态医疗数据中常见的类别不平衡问题，现有方法容易过拟合或欠拟合，且难以捕捉跨模态交互。

Method: 设计了一个多模态课程测量器，结合了模态内置信度和模态间互补性两个指标，以及一个类别分布引导的训练调度器。

Result: 在多个多模态医疗数据集上的实验表明，CLIMD在多种指标上优于现有方法，并擅长处理不平衡数据。

Conclusion: CLIMD作为一种即插即用的课程学习框架，能够显著提高多模态医疗诊断的准确性，并在处理不平衡数据时优于现有方法。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

Motivation: 由于脑肿瘤亚型在组织病理学全切片图像中的形态学变异细微且标注数据稀缺，现有的视觉语言模型在细粒度病理特征捕捉上表现不佳，导致亚型区分效果不理想。

Method: FG-PAN 包含两个关键模块：局部特征细化模块和细粒度文本描述生成模块，通过将细化后的视觉特征与LLM生成的细粒度描述对齐，增强类别的可分性。

Result: 在多个公共病理数据集（如EBRAINS和TCGA）上的广泛实验表明，FG-PAN 在零样本脑肿瘤亚型分类中表现优异。

Conclusion: FG-PAN 在零样本脑肿瘤亚型分类中实现了最先进的性能和强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

Motivation: 现有方法在未知生成器生成的假图像上泛化能力不足，需提升模型对多样化测试图像的灵活性。

Method: 提出Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL)框架，包含Conditional Information Learner和Confidence-Driven Adaptive Prediction两个模块，通过动态调整输入图像的提示增强模型适应性。

Result: IAPL在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL框架通过自适应模块显著提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力，在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到了95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在图像地理定位任务中的表现，尤其是其在视觉推理方面的能力，以应用于危机响应、数字取证和基于位置的情报等领域。

Method: 研究引入了IMAGEO-Bench基准，系统地评估了准确性、距离误差、地理空间偏差和推理过程，并在三个多样化数据集上进行了实验。

Result: 实验揭示了明显的性能差异，闭源模型通常表现出更强的推理能力，同时发现了地理空间偏差，即LLMs在高资源地区表现更好。

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench 提供了一个严谨的视角来评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的空间推理能力，并为构建地理定位感知的AI系统提供了启示。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Conclusion: LLaDA-MedV在生物医学图像理解方面表现出色，通过明确的响应长度控制能够生成更长的、信息量更大的回答，且在多个VQA基准测试中创下新记录。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

Conclusion: 本论文通过提出一种新颖的预处理框架，成功将深度学习与经典编解码器结合，显著提升了G-PCC的压缩效率，同时保持了其互操作性和计算灵活性，为实际部署提供了理想解决方案。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 解决WSI分析中由于领域差距和补丁冗余导致的效率低下和性能下降问题。

Method: 提出了Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR)框架，采用两阶段选择性采样策略和Local-to-Global Network，整合局部细节与全局上下文信息。

Result: 在Camelyon16、TCGA-NSCLC和TCGA-RCC数据集上，CDSR在分类任务中准确率和ROC曲线下面积分别提升了6.3%和5.5%，且仅需平均7,070个高分辨率补丁。

Conclusion: CDSR框架通过双尺度重建和选择性采样策略，显著提高了WSI分析的效率和准确性，仅需少量高分辨率补丁即可实现优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Motivation: 现有方法通过学习演示图像来解决3D物体affordance grounding问题，但未能捕捉图像中的通用affordance知识，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出了DAG框架，利用文本到图像扩散模型的冻结内部表示，结合affordance块和多源affordance解码器，实现3D密集affordance预测。

Result: 实验评估表明，DAG模型在3D affordance grounding任务上优于现有方法，并展现出开放世界的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAG框架通过利用文本到图像扩散模型的冻结内部表示，成功解锁了扩散模型中的affordance知识，实现了3D affordance grounding，并在实验中表现出色，具有开放世界的泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Result: MAP方法在POPE、MME和MMHal-Bench等基准测试中显著提升了模型的事实一致性和性能。

Conclusion: MAP方法通过引入地图级注意力处理和全局-局部对数融合机制，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的事实一致性，减少了幻觉现象，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

TL;DR: VELA提出了一种基于速度驱动的Level-set方法，通过可解释的几何建模实现弱指导下的高效Amodal分割，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖强提示（如可见掩码或边界框），成本高且不实用；且缺乏几何可解释性，无法明确建模形状演化。

Method: VELA是一种端到端的VElocity驱动的Level-set Amodal分割方法，通过预测形状特定的运动场指导轮廓演化。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、D2SA和KINS基准测试中，VELA表现优于现有方法，仅需单点提示。

Conclusion: VELA方法通过可解释的几何建模在弱指导条件下显著提升了Amodal分割性能，仅需单点提示即可超越现有强提示方法。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法因单一模型限制而难以处理多样形状和复杂遮挡的问题。

Method: 采用基于形状的稀疏混合专家框架（ShapeMoE），学习潜在形状分布空间并动态路由到特定形状的轻量级专家。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、KINS和D2SA数据集上，ShapeMoE在遮挡区域分割方面表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过动态路由和轻量级专家设计，显著提升了遮挡区域分割的性能，并在多个数据集上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

TL;DR: Rein++ 是一个高效的 VFM 分割框架，通过域泛化（Rein-G）和域适应（Rein-A）解决数据规模和域偏移问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割在 VFM 中的应用面临两个主要挑战：数据规模差异（分割数据集通常远小于预训练数据集）和域分布偏移（现实场景多样性导致预训练数据不足）。Rein++ 旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Rein++ 包括两个主要组件：Rein-G（域泛化）通过可训练的实例感知令牌优化 VFM 特征，微调不到 1% 的主干参数；Rein-A（域适应）在实例和逻辑级别进行无监督域适应，并利用 Segment Anything 模型的类无关能力增强目标域边界细节。

Result: 实验表明，Rein++ 在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，证明了其作为高效、可泛化和自适应的分割解决方案的有效性。

Conclusion: Rein++ 是一个高效的基于视觉基础模型（VFM）的分割框架，通过其域泛化解决方案 Rein-G 和域适应解决方案 Rein-A，显著提升了语义分割任务的泛化能力和适应性，即使对于具有数十亿参数的大型模型也表现优异。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

<details>

Motivation: 对抗性补丁攻击威胁现代视觉模型的可靠性，需要系统性评估补丁放置的影响。

Method: 提出了一个简单的分割引导放置启发式方法，利用现成的掩模识别易受攻击区域，无需任何梯度查询。

Result: 在五种架构（包括对抗训练的ResNet50）上，该方法将攻击成功率比随机或固定放置提高了8到13个百分点。

Conclusion: PatchMap及其相关代码的公开发布，以及即将发布的完整PatchMap基准（6.5B预测，多个骨干网络），将加速基于位置感知防御和自适应攻击的研究。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

TL;DR: Prompt-in-Image通过嵌入文本到图像提升Qwen2.5-VL性能，但对LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP无效甚至有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision-Language Models (VLMs)中的多模态信息对齐问题，减少幻觉现象。

Method: 提出Prompt-in-Image方法，将文本指令直接嵌入图像，强制模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL的POPE准确率提升4.1%，幻觉率降低；LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能显著下降，准确率接近随机水平。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image方法通过将文本指令嵌入图像，统一了信息处理模态，显著提升了Qwen2.5-VL的性能并减少了幻觉，但对LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP则因注意力偏差导致性能下降。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

Method: 提出DisCo3D框架，包括：1）使用多视角输入微调3D生成器以适应场景；2）通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器；3）利用高斯泼溅优化编辑后的多视角输出为3D表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，DisCo3D能够稳定实现多视角一致性，并在编辑质量上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D通过将3D一致性先验知识蒸馏到2D编辑器中，显著提升了3D编辑的多视角一致性和编辑质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

Motivation: 简化传统的两步区域对应表示方法，利用预训练分割模型（如SAM）实现无需训练的注册。

Method: 引入“对应提示问题”，提出“逆向提示”解决方案，并开发了一种新的注册算法，通过边缘化倒置提示在提示和空间维度上识别多个配对ROI。

Result: 在3D前列腺MR、3D腹部MR、3D肺部CT、2D组织病理学和2D航空图像等多种应用中，PromptReg在Dice和目标注册误差指标上优于基于强度的迭代算法和基于学习的DDF预测网络。

Conclusion: PromptReg提出了一种无需训练的注册方法，通过直接搜索对应提示简化了传统区域匹配的两步流程，并在多种医学和非医学图像上表现出色，甚至与需要全标注数据的弱监督方法竞争。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

Conclusion: VTG框架通过插值初始化、双向运动微调和表示对齐正则化，显著提升了过渡视频的平滑性和语义连贯性，在TransitBench基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

Conclusion: TimeExpert通过动态路由任务特定令牌到专门专家，有效提升了视频时间定位任务的性能，并在多种应用中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian 能够有效且高效地更新基于 3D-GS 的地图，处理自动驾驶场景中常见的环境变化，并利用新旧场景信息生成更高质量的重建结果。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

Conclusion: GAID框架通过帧级门控融合和方向性自适应语义扰动，显著提升了文本-视频检索的性能和效率，实现了跨模态的细粒度对齐和鲁棒性增强。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of
multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing
datasets. We present HateClipSeg, a large-scale multimodal dataset with both
video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments

three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement
(Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark
performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful
Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度视觉模型中视觉概念的分布式表示使得定位特定概念在模型中的编码位置成为关键但具挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入了一种称为Granular Concept Circuit（GCC）的有效电路发现方法，通过迭代评估神经元间的连接性，关注功能依赖和语义对齐。

Result: GCC方法在多种深度图像分类模型中验证了其多功能性和有效性。

Conclusion: GCC方法首次在细粒度水平上识别与特定视觉概念相关的电路，为深度视觉模型提供了深刻的、概念层面的解释。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频中频繁的视角变化和复杂的运动动态导致现有方法在亲和力测量和身份关联上表现不佳，需要一种更有效的方法来结合外观和运动线索。

Method: 提出了AMOT方法，包括外观-运动一致性（AMC）矩阵和运动感知轨迹延续（MTC）模块，共同利用外观和运动线索进行更可靠的跟踪。

Result: 在VisDrone2019、UAVDT和VT-MOT-UAV三个基准测试中，AMOT表现优于现有最先进方法，且具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AMOT通过结合外观和运动线索，特别是在无人机视频中，显著提高了多目标跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性，且在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型（RSFMs）多基于光学影像预训练，缺乏多/高光谱数据支持，需探索如何高效适配多样光谱模态而无需大量光谱预训练。

Method: 提出SpectralX框架，包含两阶段训练：第一阶段使用掩码重建任务和HyperT提取空间与光谱维度属性令牌，结合AoMoA动态聚合多属性专家知识；第二阶段插入Are-adapter，通过迭代查询高低级语义特征实现任务定制化调整。

Result: SpectralX能有效解释新区域或季节的光谱影像，提升领域泛化性能。

Conclusion: SpectralX框架通过两阶段训练有效适应了多样光谱模态，显著提升了领域泛化性能，且代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

Motivation: 现有方法通常将语义特征附加到自由高斯集合并通过可微分渲染提取特征，导致分割噪声和高斯选择混乱。

Method: 引入AG$^2$aussian框架，利用锚图结构组织语义特征并规范高斯基本体，促进紧凑且实例感知的高斯分布，并支持基于图的传播。

Result: 在四种应用中验证了方法的优势，包括交互式点击查询、开放词汇文本驱动查询、对象移除编辑和物理模拟。

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian框架通过锚图结构有效组织了语义特征并规范了高斯基本体，实现了干净且准确的实例级高斯选择，为多种应用场景提供了优势。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出SEA方法，利用基础模型的漏洞攻击微调后的VLMs，展示了高转移攻击成功率和毒性率，呼吁加强模型生命周期的防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调开源视觉语言模型（VLMs）可能保留基础模型中的漏洞，使其易受可转移越狱攻击的影响。本研究旨在揭示这一风险并展示其实际威胁。

Method: 提出了模拟集成攻击（SEA），一种新的灰盒越狱方法，结合了微调轨迹模拟（FTS）和定向提示引导（TPG）两种关键技术。FTS通过模拟视觉编码器的参数变化生成可转移的对抗图像，而TPG是一种文本策略，引导语言解码器输出对抗性优化的结果。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL家族（2B和7B）上的实验表明，SEA在多种微调变体上实现了超过86.5%的高转移攻击成功率和接近49.5%的毒性率，甚至包括那些专门微调以提高安全性的变体。

Conclusion: 研究强调了保护微调专有视觉语言模型（VLMs）免受开源基础模型继承的可转移漏洞的紧迫性，并呼吁开发跨整个模型生命周期的全面防御措施。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

Motivation: 长期动作预测在人机交互和辅助技术中至关重要，现有方法在利用细粒度视觉线索、语义依赖关系和显式认知推理方面存在不足。

Method: INSIGHT 是一个统一的两阶段框架：第一阶段从手-物体交互区域提取语义丰富的特征，并通过动词-名词共现矩阵增强动作表示；第二阶段引入基于强化学习的模块，模拟显式认知推理过程。

Result: 在 Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens-55 和 EGTEA Gaze+ 基准测试中，INSIGHT 实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: INSIGHT 框架在多个基准测试中表现出色，展示了其在长期动作预测中的有效性和强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型依赖包含敏感信息的大规模数据集，引发隐私问题。差分隐私数据生成虽能限制隐私泄露，但需要大量数据才能达到与原始数据相当的性能。数据集蒸馏（DD）因其高效的训练和存储特性，成为与差分隐私机制结合的理想选择。然而，现有方法存在采样-优化同步和依赖随机初始化网络的噪声训练信号问题，导致隐私信息利用效率低下。

Method: 论文引入了一种新框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程，并在信息子空间中进行匹配，以减少差分隐私噪声的影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，新方法在每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，在蒸馏集大小仅为先前方法的五分之一时性能提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程，并在信息子空间中进行匹配，显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的性能。在CIFAR-10上，该方法在每类50张图像的情况下实现了10.0%的性能提升，并在蒸馏集大小仅为先前最先进方法的五分之一时，性能提升了8.3%。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Motivation: 奶牛的活动和行为与其健康和福利密切相关，传统的手动监测方法劳动密集且不一致，因此需要一种自动、准确的监测系统。

Method: 研究采用先进的计算机视觉技术，包括实例分割和跟踪算法，通过几何对齐六个摄像头视角创建全景视图，使用改进的YOLO11-m模型进行检测，并结合SAMURAI模型和运动感知的Linear Kalman滤波器进行实例分割和对象跟踪。

Conclusion: 该研究开发的多摄像头实时跟踪系统在复杂室内环境中有效地监测了奶牛的活动和行为，显著优于现有技术，并有望通过活动量化和行为分类改善早期疾病预测。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

Motivation: 自然语言导航因语言的模糊性和冗长性在复杂环境中效果不佳，因此提出视觉提示导航以减少模糊性并提升非专家用户的友好性。

Method: 构建了VPN任务，包括离散和连续导航设置，并基于R2R和R2R-CE数据集扩展了两个新数据集（R2R-VP和R2R-CE-VP）。设计了VPNet基线网络，并采用视图级和轨迹级数据增强策略提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Visual Prompt Navigation（VPN）范式通过视觉提示在2D地图上导航，有效减少了语言指导的模糊性，为非专家用户提供了更直观的导航方式。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

Method: 采用点基表示和添加图推理模块，通过学习点邻域间的亲和性来隐式学习解剖信息。

Result: 在MSD和LiTS数据集上，提出的方法在Dice系数和平均表面距离得分上与四种领先的点基方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的点基方法在Couinaud分割中表现出色，无需显式提供肝脏血管结构先验知识，通过图推理模块隐式学习解剖结构，在MSD和LiTS数据集上与现有方法竞争。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: IAUNet通过结合U-Net架构和查询机制，提出了一种高效的细胞实例分割方法，并在多个数据集上超越了现有最先进模型。

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: DBOM是一种通过解耦后门触发器和对象表示来识别和中和未见后门威胁的框架，实验证明其能有效提升DNN训练安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对深度神经网络（DNNs）和生成式AI（GenAI）中后门攻击的日益复杂化，尤其是多触发器和跨类别的攻击配置，传统检测方法难以应对。因此，需要一种能主动识别和中和未见后门威胁的框架。

Method: DBOM利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）的预训练编码器，通过可学习的视觉提示库和提示前缀调优，将潜在表示分解为独立的触发器和对象组件。此外，引入了触发器和对象分离及多样性损失，以进一步解耦视觉特征。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB数据集上的实验结果表明，DBOM能够在下游训练前鲁棒地检测被投毒的图像，显著提升训练管道的安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM框架通过解耦后门触发器和对象表示，有效识别和中和训练中未见的后门威胁，显著提升了DNN训练管道的安全性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过结合扩散模型和物理增强的运动细化模型，显著提高了3D手部运动重建的准确性和时间一致性，特别是在手-物体交互场景中，达到了现有基准的最先进性能。

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 本文提出了VLM4D基准测试，揭示了现有视觉语言模型在时空推理能力上的不足，并提出了改进方向，如4D特征场重建和时空监督微调，以推动更强大的动态环境视觉智能发展。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Motivation: 解决电商场景中背景生成任务的两大挑战：产品与背景的一致性及仅依赖文本提示的局限性。

Method: 基于DreamEcom-400K数据集，提出了DreamPainter框架，灵活结合文本提示和参考图像信息作为控制信号。

Conclusion: DreamPainter框架通过结合文本提示和参考图像信息，显著提升了电商场景下背景生成任务的效果，实现了高产品一致性和精确控制。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

<details>

Motivation: 事件网络由于数据分布的非结构化和时空不均匀性，严重依赖任务特定设计，难以复用现有架构。OmniEvent旨在提供一个统一的框架，消除任务特定设计的需求。

Method: OmniEvent 提出了一种解耦-增强-融合的范式，通过在空间和时间域上独立进行局部特征聚合和增强，避免不均匀性问题。空间填充曲线的应用扩大了感受野，同时提高了内存和计算效率。通过注意力机制融合不同域的特征以学习时空交互。

Conclusion: OmniEvent 是一个统一的事件表示学习框架，通过解耦-增强-融合的范式，解决了事件数据在时空域的不均匀性问题，并在多个任务和数据集上实现了SOTA性能，最高提升了68.2%。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

Motivation: 现有自监督预训练方法因点判别难度不足导致模型崩溃和结构信息缺失，影响了表达可靠性和性能。

Method: GaussianCross将不一致的3D点云转换为统一的立方体归一化高斯表示，并引入三属性自适应蒸馏溅射模块，构建3D特征场以捕获外观、几何和语义线索。

Result: GaussianCross在ScanNet、ScanNet200和S3DIS等基准测试中表现出卓越的参数和数据效率，通过线性探测（<0.1%参数）和有限数据训练（1%场景）优于现有方法，并在ScanNet200任务中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: GaussianCross通过整合3D高斯溅射技术，提出了一种新颖的跨模态自监督3D表示学习架构，有效解决了模型崩溃和结构信息缺失的问题，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

TL;DR: CGT熵模型通过优化时空上下文建模，显著减少计算开销并提升编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件熵模型在利用时空上下文时存在模型复杂度和计算成本增加的问题，且空间上下文模型缺乏对依赖顺序的明确建模，限制了解码时的上下文可用性。

Method: 通过时间上下文重采样器和依赖加权的空间上下文分配器（教师-学生网络）来优化时空上下文建模，减少计算开销并明确空间依赖顺序。

Result: CGT模型在实验中展示了显著的性能提升，熵建模时间减少约65%，BD-Rate降低11%。

Conclusion: 提出的CGT熵模型在减少熵建模时间和提高编码效率方面表现出色，相比现有最优条件熵模型，实现了约65%的时间节省和11%的BD-Rate降低。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

Motivation: 现有的训练无关方法在加速扩散变换器（DiTs）推理时存在内存和计算开销大、预测失败时输出质量下降的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的泰勒加速方法，将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级，并基于第一个块的预测误差动态调整缓存机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现了3.17倍、2.36倍和4.14倍的加速，且质量损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 通过将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级，并引入动态缓存机制，该方法在保持生成质量的同时显著提高了推理速度，实现了在多个模型上的高效加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Motivation: 现有研究多基于明确指示的搜索轨迹和抽象视觉刺激，忽视了场景上下文，而人类视觉搜索实际上受场景特征驱动。因此，本文旨在填补这一研究空白，探索在自由视觉搜索和现实场景中区分目标与非目标注视的可行性。

Method: 采用眼动和脑电图特征结合的方法，在36名参与者的用户研究中，使用140种现实视觉搜索场景（如桌面图标搜索和杂乱车间工具寻找）进行实验。

Conclusion: 本文通过结合眼动和脑电图特征的方法，显著提高了在现实场景中区分目标与非目标注视的准确性，达到了83.6%的交叉用户评估准确率，远超之前基于扫视相关电位的方法（56.9%）。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

TL;DR: Text2Lip 通过音素-视觉桥梁和渐进式替换策略，实现了高质量、可控的说话人脸生成，解决了音频驱动方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动方法依赖高质量配对视听数据且声学-唇动映射存在模糊性，导致可扩展性和鲁棒性不足。Text2Lip 旨在通过文本输入解决这些问题。

Method: Text2Lip 采用基于课程学习的渐进式 viseme-音频替换策略，结合跨模态注意力从增强的 viseme 特征重建伪音频，并利用地标引导的渲染器合成逼真面部视频。

Result: Text2Lip 在语义保真度、视觉真实感和模态鲁棒性上优于现有方法，支持音频存在和缺失场景下的鲁棒生成。

Conclusion: Text2Lip 提出了一种新的范式，通过构建可解释的音素-视觉桥梁，实现了语义一致且视觉准确的说话人脸生成，在可控性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像研究中大规模数据共享的需求日益增长，但患者隐私保护是一个重要挑战。现有的去标识化工具有效性评估不足，且多依赖主观审查，限制了可重复性和监管信心。

Method: 研究团队利用公开可用的去标识化数据创建了MIDI数据集，嵌入了合成的PHI/PII信息，并开发了配套的评估工具，包括Python脚本、答案密钥和映射文件。

Result: MIDI数据集包含538名受试者、605项研究、708个系列和53,581个DICOM图像实例，涵盖了多种厂商、成像方式和癌症类型。评估工具支持自动比对去标识化结果与预期转换，符合HIPAA隐私规则和DICOM标准。

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一个开放访问的DICOM数据集和评估框架，用于标准化和客观化医学图像去标识化工作流程，从而促进更安全、更一致的医学图像共享。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

TL;DR: Hydra利用毫米波雷达和摄像头技术检测叶片湿润时间，通过CNN和Transformer结合的方法，在不同环境下实现高精度检测，填补了现有技术的应用空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LWD检测方法缺乏标准化测量技术，且对不同植物特性的适应性不足，导致在实际农业应用中的精度和鲁棒性受限。

Method: 设计了一个卷积神经网络（CNN）来选择性融合多张毫米波深度图像与RGB图像生成特征图，随后通过基于Transformer的编码器捕捉特征图间的内在联系，最终通过分类器进行检测。训练过程中还进行了数据增强以提高模型泛化能力。

Result: Hydra在多种场景下对叶片湿润的分类准确率高达96%，在农场实际部署中（包括雨天、黎明或光线不足的夜晚）仍能保持约90%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra 结合毫米波雷达与摄像头技术，通过检测叶片上的水分来测量叶片湿润时间（LWD），在多种环境下表现出高准确性和鲁棒性，为农业实践提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Motivation: 全天候智能眼镜作为连续情境感知平台，需要解决多模态AI代理集成带来的能源效率挑战，以实现人类记忆增强。

Method: EgoTrigger利用轻量级音频模型（YAMNet）和自定义分类头，通过手-物交互（HOI）的音频线索（如抽屉打开或药瓶开启的声音）选择性激活高功耗摄像头。

Result: EgoTrigger平均减少54%的帧数，显著节省了高功耗传感组件（如摄像头）和下游操作（如无线传输）的能源，同时在情景记忆任务上保持可比性能。

Conclusion: EgoTrigger的策略为全天候智能眼镜提供了一种有前景的能源高效解决方案，支持如帮助用户回忆物品位置或日常活动信息等应用。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Conclusion: HGTS-Former在多个数据集上表现出色，验证了其有效性，源代码将公开供进一步研究。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业检测中管理多个独立的任务特定模型带来了复杂性、低效性和维护负担，统一视觉语言模型有望简化这一流程。

Method: 使用基于Florence-2的VLM（InspectVLM）和新的多模态、多任务检测数据集InspectMM进行评估。

Result: InspectVLM在图像级分类和结构化关键点任务上表现有竞争力，但在核心检测指标上不及传统ResNet模型，且在低提示变异性下表现脆弱，细粒度对象检测输出退化，并经常依赖记忆的语言响应。

Conclusion: 当前的统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽然在概念上优雅，但在视觉基础和鲁棒性方面不足，无法满足对精度要求高的工业检测需求。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Motivation: 减少对大规模标注数据集的依赖，探索未标注数据作为标签高效目标检测的可扩展资源。

Method: 通过SimCLR框架对YOLOv5和YOLOv8的卷积主干进行预训练，采用全局池化和投影头，并利用COCO未标注数据集（120k图像）的增强优化对比损失。预训练后的主干在有限标注数据的自行车检测任务上进行微调。

Result: SSL预训练的YOLOv8在mAP@50:95上达到0.7663，优于其监督对应模型，且在低标注数据情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: 对比自监督学习（SSL）预训练为一阶段目标检测器（如YOLO系列）提供了显著的优势，尤其是在标注数据有限的情况下，能够提高mAP、加速收敛并改善精确率-召回率性能。

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper

understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on

Conclusion: 该方法通过二维表示和Quasi-Fresnel变换显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求，为实时高分辨率NLOS成像在轻量设备上的应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

Conclusion: 本文提出的冲突自由引导和分层注意力方法显著提高了图像提示生成模型的性能，能够更忠实地反映图像提示的细节。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

*Ziling Wang,Shuya Yang,Jialin Lu,Ka-Ho Chow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protego是一种用户隐私保护方法，通过动态3D面具保护面部图像，显著降低人脸识别检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对人脸识别技术带来的隐私威胁，如未经同意的身份推断和数字足迹暴露。

Method: Protego将用户的3D面部特征封装为姿态不变的2D表示，并动态变形为自然外观的3D面具，应用于在线分享前。

Result: Protego显著降低了多种黑盒人脸识别模型的检索准确性，性能至少优于现有方法2倍。

Conclusion: Protego为对抗人脸识别技术滥用提供了有效的隐私保护方法，显著降低了检索准确性，并在视觉一致性上表现优异。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

*Hui Xie,Haiqin Hu,Lijuan Ding,Qing Li,Yue Sun,Tao Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADDiff-Dose 提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的放疗剂量预测方法，显著提升预测精度和临床效率，减少规划时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在泛化性、预测准确性和临床适用性上的局限性，减少放疗规划中对专家经验的依赖，提升效率和准确性。

Method: 使用 LightweightVAE3D 压缩高维 CT 数据，结合多模态输入（如靶区和危及器官掩膜、束流参数），通过渐进噪声添加和去噪框架实现端到端剂量预测。采用多头注意力机制整合条件特征，并使用复合损失函数（MSE、条件项和 KL 散度）确保剂量学准确性和临床约束。

Result: 在大规模公共数据集（2,877 例）和三个外部机构队列（共 450 例）上，ADDiff-Dose 显著优于传统基线模型（MAE 0.101-0.154，DICE 系数 0.927，脊髓最大剂量误差 <0.1 Gy），单例规划时间缩短至 22 秒。

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose 是一种创新的条件扩散模型，显著提高了放疗剂量预测的准确性和临床适用性，为自动化治疗规划提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出MVV数据集，用于交通标志细粒度标注，并证明DINOv2在自动驾驶场景中优于现有VLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如Mapillary）通常仅提供粗粒度标签，缺乏对语义重要类型（如停车标志或限速标志）的区分，限制了自动驾驶决策的准确性和安全性。

Method: 通过分解复合交通标志为细粒度、语义上有意义的类别，并手动由专家标注像素级实例掩码，创建了MVV数据集。

Result: DINOv2模型在MVV数据集上表现优于所有VLM基线，不仅在交通标志识别上，也在车辆和人类等常见类别上。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个名为MVV的新验证集，用于交通标志的细粒度标注，并展示了DINOv2模型在该数据集上的优越性能，为自动驾驶场景中的密集语义匹配提供了强基准。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

TL;DR: HCF框架通过潜在空间变换和量化策略优化，显著提升分布式图像压缩的效率和性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式多阶段图像压缩中渐进方法计算资源利用不足、连续压缩效率低下且累积质量损失，以及固定参数模型缺乏编码后灵活性的问题。

Method: 提出了分层级联框架（HCF），通过直接潜在空间变换和策略驱动的量化控制优化率失真权衡，并基于差分熵分析确立了边缘量化原则。

Result: 在Kodak、CLIC和CLIC2020-mobile数据集上，HCF在PSNR上优于连续压缩方法（最高5.56% BD-Rate），节省高达97.8% FLOPs、96.5% GPU内存和90.0%执行时间；同时优于最先进的渐进压缩方法（最高12.64% BD-Rate），并支持无重训练跨质量适应（7.13-10.87% BD-Rate降低）。

Conclusion: HCF框架在分布式多阶段图像压缩系统中表现出卓越的率失真性能和计算效率，显著优于现有方法，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

TL;DR: StarPose是一种自回归扩散框架，通过历史姿态集成和空间-时间物理引导，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有扩散方法在空间和时间相关性上的不足，尤其是在时间一致性和姿态序列准确性上的局限，提出了StarPose框架。

Method: StarPose采用自回归扩散过程建模2D到3D姿态映射，结合HPIM生成历史姿态嵌入，并通过STPG机制迭代优化去噪过程，确保空间解剖合理性和时间运动动力学。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，StarPose在3D人体姿态估计上实现了更高的准确性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose通过自回归扩散框架和历史姿态集成模块（HPIM）及空间-时间物理引导（STPG）机制，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和时间一致性，超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

Motivation: 传统的自由文本报告存在冗余和语言不一致的问题，而现有的结构化报告生成方法要么依赖预定义标签集，要么采用模板化方法，导致表达受限或遗漏临床重要细节。

Method: 首先构建了一个稳健的胸部X光数据集（MIMIC-STRUC），包含疾病名称、严重程度、概率和解剖位置等信息。随后训练了一个基于LLM的模型来生成标准化、高质量的报告。

Result: 提出了一个新的评估指标（S-Score），不仅衡量疾病预测准确性，还评估疾病相关细节的精确性，从而提供了一个更符合临床需求的报告质量评估标准。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的结构化放射学报告生成方法（S-RRG），通过构建数据集、训练模型和引入新的评估框架，展示了结构化报告的有效性，并强调了针对S-RRG量身定制的评估指标的重要性。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

Motivation: 尽管FLUX和Stable Diffusion v3等大规模模型在逼真图像生成方面取得了进展，但其实际部署仍受限于参数微调的内在困难。分布式开源LoRA模块的利用面临稀疏元数据标注、零样本适应需求和次优融合策略三大挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一个包含两个关键组件的框架：(1)基于权重编码的LoRA检索器，建立LoRA参数矩阵与文本提示之间的共享语义空间；(2)细粒度门控融合机制，计算特定上下文的融合权重以优化多个LoRA模块的集成。

Result: 该方法显著提升了图像生成性能，实现了基础模型的可扩展和数据高效增强。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入语义驱动的LoRA检索和动态聚合框架，成功解决了分布式开源LoRA模块在实际部署中的三大挑战，显著提升了图像生成性能，为社区开发的LoRA模块与实用部署需求之间建立了关键桥梁。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

Conclusion: DeflareMamba 通过引入状态空间模型，有效解决了镜头光晕去除中的信息混淆问题，并在保持非光晕区域自然外观的同时，显著提升了视觉物体识别和跨模态语义理解的能力。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

Method: 提出NRE-Net多模态检测框架，结合自适应双流融合模块（ADFM）和事件感知融合模块（EAFM），优化RGB、法线图和事件数据的融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，NRE-Net的mAP50分别比帧基方法（如YOLOX）提升7.9%和6.1%，并超越SFNet和SODFormer。

Conclusion: NRE-Net通过融合单目预测的表面法线图、RGB图像和事件流，显著提升了在不利光照条件下的物体检测准确率，超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

Conclusion: 论文提出的视频扩散增强4D高斯泼溅框架显著提升了动态场景建模能力，特别是在快速移动物体上，相较于基线方法在新型视图合成上实现了约2 dB的PSNR增益。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

Method: 提出Free-MoRef方法，通过重构视觉令牌为多参考短序列，并引入MoRef-attention和参考融合步骤，实现长视频帧的高效理解。

Result: 实验表明，Free-MoRef在2×至8×更长输入帧的情况下保持即时响应，性能显著提升，甚至超过专门训练的长视频MLLMs。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef通过无训练的多参考注意力机制，显著提升了长视频理解任务的性能，且在计算成本较低的情况下实现了高效推理。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

TL;DR: AID4AD是一个公开数据集，将高分辨率航空影像与nuScenes数据集对齐，用于自动驾驶感知任务。实验显示其在提升地图构建和轨迹预测性能方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究航空影像与自动驾驶车辆感知任务的集成，以提供一种可扩展且适应性强的环境上下文来源。

Method: 提出了一个对齐工作流程，使用SLAM-based点云地图将航空影像精确对齐到nuScenes本地坐标系，并通过手动质量控制过程进一步优化数据集。

Result: 实验表明，航空影像在在线地图构建中提高了15-23%的准确性，在轨迹预测中提升了2%的性能。

Conclusion: AID4AD数据集展示了航空影像作为自动驾驶车辆感知任务的补充数据的潜力，特别是在高清地图不可用或维护成本高的情况下。数据集、评估代码和预训练模型的公开发布旨在推动该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Conclusion: TrackletGait 在真实世界的步态识别中表现出色，通过创新的采样、下采样和损失函数设计，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

TL;DR: AURORA框架通过链式思维提示和两阶段训练策略，提升了音频-视觉分割任务的推理和分割性能，并在基准测试中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真正的语义理解，倾向于记忆固定的推理模式，且联合训练推理和分割可能损害像素级精度。

Method: 采用结构化链式思维（CoT）提示机制引导模型逐步推理，并引入分割特征蒸馏损失以整合推理能力而不影响分割性能。此外，设计了两阶段训练策略：首先是‘纠正性反思式训练’阶段，利用自我纠正提升推理路径质量；随后通过组奖励策略优化（GRPO）进行强化学习以增强模型在挑战性场景中的鲁棒性。

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，并能有效泛化到未参考分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA框架通过结合链式思维提示、特征蒸馏损失和两阶段训练策略，显著提升了参考音频-视觉分割任务的性能，并在未参考分割任务中展现了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于模糊的文本提示或昂贵的人类偏好数据，难以实现精细且连续的美学属性控制。

Method: 通过预训练的视觉-语言模型量化抽象美学，并采用轻量级值编码器将标量强度映射到可学习的嵌入中，实现在扩散生成中的直观美学操控。

Result: AttriCtrl 能够准确控制单个属性并灵活组合多属性，且与流行的开源可控生成框架完全兼容。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl 提供了一种精确且连续控制美学属性的方法，与现有生成框架兼容，展示了强大的集成能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种统一的模型，将检测和姿态估计整合到单一框架中，通过神经网格模型和多模型RANSAC实现了RGB图像上的最先进姿态估计，并展示了更高的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and

Motivation: 当前方法在平衡原始主题和风格方面存在困难，且通常需要额外训练。K-LoRA虽然提出了一种无需训练的融合方法，但涉及多个超参数，难以适应所有风格和主题。

Method: EST-LoRA采用类似于混合专家（MoE）的架构，在每个注意力层内自适应选择主题LoRA和风格LoRA。

Result: 实验结果表明，EST-LoRA在定性和定量评估中均优于现有方法，且生成速度更快。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA提出了一种无需训练的LoRA融合方法，通过综合考虑矩阵能量、风格差异分数和时间步长三个关键因素，实现了在生成过程中对主题和风格LoRA的自适应选择，从而在质量和速度上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Conclusion: CL3AN数据集及提出的学习框架有效解决了复杂光照条件下的图像恢复问题，展示了在非均匀彩色光照和材料特定反射变化下的鲁棒性，同时保持计算成本竞争力。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations

Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种持续零阶适应（ZOA）框架，显著提升了量化模型在动态环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12

TL;DR: CAM通过动态内容感知和全局先验优化Mamba模型，显著提升图像压缩性能，在多个基准测试中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mamba模型因内容无关的固定扫描方式而无法充分利用内容依赖关系，限制了图像压缩的性能。

Method: 提出CAM，结合内容感知的令牌重组和全局先验的提示字典，动态优化Mamba模型的内容依赖性捕捉能力。

Result: CMIC模型在Kodak、Tecnick和CLIC基准测试中，分别实现了-15.91%、-21.34%和-17.58%的BD-rate提升，优于VTM-21.0。

Conclusion: CAM（Content-Adaptive Mamba）通过内容感知的令牌重组和全局先验集成，显著提升了图像压缩的性能，在多个基准测试中超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于WSI的大尺寸特性，处理和分析需要大量存储和计算资源，且随着临床和医院中WSI数量的快速增加，亟需一种持续学习系统，能够高效处理并适应新任务，同时保持资源效率和高性能。

Method: 本研究提出了COSFormer，一种基于Transformer的持续学习框架，专为多任务WSI分析设计，能够顺序学习新任务而无需重新访问完整历史数据集。

Conclusion: COSFormer被证明是一种适用于临床应用中持续WSI分析的强大解决方案，其通用性和有效性优于现有持续学习框架。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型的多模态实体链接方法存在两个问题：不必要的图像数据使用和一次性视觉特征提取的局限性，影响了效果和准确性。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的框架I2CR，通过文本优先策略和多轮迭代整合视觉线索来优化多模态实体链接任务。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的公共数据集上，I2CR框架分别实现了3.2%、5.1%和1.6%的性能提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 作者提出的I2CR框架通过多轮迭代策略整合关键视觉线索，显著提升了多模态实体链接任务的性能，实验证明其在三个公共数据集上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Motivation: 减轻语义分割中繁重的标注负担，同时提升伪标签的可靠性。

Method: 开发了一种名为DerProp的半监督框架，采用新型导数标签传播技术，通过离散导数操作对像素级特征向量施加额外正则化，生成严格正则化的相似性度量。

Result: 实验验证了设计的合理性，并展示了DerProp相对于其他方法的优越性。

Conclusion: DerProp框架通过引入导数标签传播，有效提升了半监督语义分割中伪标签的可靠性，并在实验中展现出优于其他方法的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

Motivation: 病理学因超高分辨率、复杂组织结构和细微临床语义而独特，现有文本知识库无法充分利用视觉线索，导致 VLMs 易产生幻觉。

Method: 提出 Patho-AgenticRAG，一个基于权威病理学教科书页面级嵌入的多模态 RAG 框架，支持联合文本-图像搜索、推理、任务分解和多轮搜索交互。

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG 通过多模态 RAG 框架显著提升了病理学任务的准确性，支持联合文本-图像搜索，有效减少了幻觉现象，增强了临床信任。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the
Patho-AgenticRAG repository:

Motivation: 现有基于对象中心的方法依赖大量随机初始化的基元，导致效率低下和异常基元引入错误。

Method: 提出 SplatSSC 框架，包括深度分支（GMF 模块）生成稀疏且具代表性的高斯基元，以及 DGA 聚合器分解几何和语义预测以减少噪声。

Result: 在 Occ-ScanNet 数据集上，IoU 和 mIoU 分别提升 6.3% 和 4.1%，延迟和内存消耗减少超过 9.3%。

Conclusion: SplatSSC 通过深度引导的初始化策略和解耦的高斯聚合器，显著提升了单目3D语义场景补全的性能，同时在延迟和内存消耗上实现了优化。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决现有基于置信度的伪标签选择方法因模型早期误导性和过拟合不准确伪标签而导致的性能下降问题，并探索分类和分割任务之间的关联性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Hermes的半监督双阈值对比学习策略，结合了对比学习和半监督学习的优势，并开发了跨任务注意力和显著性模块以促进任务间信息共享。此外，设计了跨任务一致性学习策略以减少特征差异。

Result: 在三个超声数据集上的实验表明，Hermes在多种半监督设置下均优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: Hermes策略在多个半监督设置下表现优于现有最先进方法，证明了其在超声图像分类和分割任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

TL;DR: SGAD通过直接生成高区分度区域描述符和新型监督策略，显著提升区域匹配效率与准确性，运行时间减少60倍，并在多个任务中实现最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于区域到点匹配（A2PM）的方法依赖低效的像素级比较和复杂图匹配，限制了可扩展性。SGAD旨在从根本上重新思考基于区域的匹配，提升匹配效率和准确性。

Method: 提出了语义和几何感知描述符网络（SGAD），直接生成高区分度的区域描述符，避免了复杂的图优化；设计了分类和排序子任务的新型监督策略；引入了层次包含冗余过滤器（HCRF）消除重叠区域。

Result: SGAD显著提升了匹配性能，运行时间减少60倍（0.82秒 vs. 60.23秒），在室内外姿态估计中均实现了更高的准确性和效率，如SGAD+LoFTR在户外姿态估计中运行时间更短且准确性更高（65.98 vs. 61.11）。

Conclusion: SGAD通过引入语义和几何感知描述符网络，显著提升了区域匹配的准确性和效率，同时通过新颖的监督策略和层次包含冗余过滤器进一步优化性能，实现了在室内外姿态估计中的新最优表现。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

Method: 研究了两种预训练版本的模型：一种在原始数据上进行预训练，另一种在边缘增强数据上进行预训练。随后，在特定医学模态的原始数据子集上进行微调。通过元学习策略（基于原始图像的标准差和图像熵）选择最优预训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，选择性应用边缘增强预训练的方法比仅使用边缘增强或原始数据预训练的模型分别提高了16.42%和19.30%的分割性能。

Conclusion: 通过元学习策略选择性地应用边缘增强预训练或原始数据预训练的模型，可以显著提高多模态医学图像分割的整体性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

Motivation: 传统LiDAR和RGB相机在高动态场景中存在感知间隙，而现有整合事件相机的方法在快速运动场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种仅依赖事件相机的新型立体3D物体检测框架，通过双滤波器机制解决了事件数据中语义和几何信息的缺失问题，并在动态环境中表现优异。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的无监督异常检测方法假设所有训练数据均为正常样本，需要手动数据筛选，导致偏差和适应性受限。CoMet 旨在消除这一限制，允许模型在未筛选的数据集上学习。

Method: CoMet 结合了 Soft Confident Learning（对低置信度样本赋予较低权重）和 Meta-Learning（通过基于训练验证损失协方差的正则化更新来稳定训练），防止过拟合并增强对噪声数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 在 MVTec-AD、VIADUCT 和 KSDD2 数据集上的实验表明，CoMet 能够显著优于基线方法，对训练集中的异常不敏感，并在所有数据集上实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CoMet 是一种有效的训练策略，能够在未筛选的数据集上训练深度异常检测模型，消除手动数据筛选的需求，并在多个数据集上实现了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

Result: 研究发现，不确定性量化方法在分布外输入下比监督学习延迟模型更稳健。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法可能是AI延迟决策的一个有前景的选择。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic

TL;DR: 通过预训练2D模型生成合成几何，蒸馏出单图像场景重建模型，性能媲美多视图监督方法，动态场景表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体积重建方法虽效果显著，但通常依赖昂贵的3D真值或多视图监督，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 利用预训练的2D扩散模型和深度预测模型从单张图像生成合成场景几何，进而蒸馏出一个前馈场景重建模型。

Result: 在KITTI-360和Waymo数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能优异，尤其适用于动态场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在KITTI-360和Waymo数据集上表现出色，匹配或超越了现有基于多视图监督的最先进方法，并在动态场景中展现出独特优势。

Abstract: Volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image is crucial for a broad
range of applications like autonomous driving and robotics. Recent volumetric
reconstruction methods achieve impressive results, but generally require
expensive 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision. We propose to leverage
pre-trained 2D diffusion models and depth prediction models to generate
synthetic scene geometry from a single image. This can then be used to distill
a feed-forward scene reconstruction model. Our experiments on the challenging
KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines that use multi-view supervision, and offers unique
advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: Qwen-Image通过数据管道和渐进训练提升文本渲染能力，结合多任务和双编码机制优化图像编辑，实现多语言和编辑任务的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂文本渲染和图像编辑一致性的挑战，提升模型在多语言和图像编辑任务中的表现。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略（从非文本到文本渲染，从简单到复杂文本输入）和多任务训练范式（包括T2I、TI2I和I2I任务），并引入双编码机制（语义和重构表示）。

Result: Qwen-Image在英语和中文等语言的文本渲染以及图像编辑任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Qwen-Image通过全面的数据管道设计和渐进式训练策略，显著提升了复杂文本渲染和图像编辑的精确性，实现了在多语言和图像编辑任务中的最先进性能。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-IN通过硬负样本对比学习和长描述性标题，提升了CLIP在细粒度视觉理解上的性能，同时保持零样本能力，并减少多模态大语言模型中的视觉幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在视觉和语言对齐方面取得了成功，但其在细粒度视觉理解上的能力仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出了CLIP-IN框架，通过两个核心创新：利用指令编辑数据集作为硬负样本对来源，并采用对称硬负对比损失；以及引入长描述性标题，使用旋转位置编码捕捉丰富语义上下文。

Result: 实验表明，CLIP-IN在MMVP基准和各种细粒度视觉识别任务上取得了显著提升，同时不损害在广泛分类和检索任务上的零样本性能。此外，将CLIP-IN的视觉表示整合到多模态大语言模型中显著减少了视觉幻觉并增强了推理能力。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了通过结合针对性的基于指令的对比学习和全面的描述性信息，显著提升了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在细粒度理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LPD方法通过构建特征特定的共同空间和去相关损失，提升了视频搜索的多样性和准确性，在TRECVID AVS基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS)任务中，视频的视觉多样性是主要挑战。现有解决方案多将多个特征融合到一个或多个共同空间，但忽视了多样性空间的需求。因此，需要一种新方法来充分利用个体特征的表达能力。

Method: LPD（Learning Partially Decorrelated common spaces）方法包括两个关键创新：特征特定的共同空间构建和去相关损失。此外，还设计了基于熵的公平多空间三元组排序损失以增强多空间收敛的一致性。

Result: 在TRECVID AVS基准测试（2016-2023）上的大量实验证明了LPD的有效性。此外，LPD空间的可视化展示了其增强结果多样性的能力。

Conclusion: LPD方法通过构建特征特定的共同空间和去相关损失，有效提升了视频搜索的多样性和准确性，在TRECVID AVS基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像编辑应用中，如何平衡重建保真度和编辑灵活性是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出了Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP)，一个零样本框架，利用最优传输理论在rectified flow模型中指导逆向过程，通过轨迹优化平衡重建和编辑。

Result: 在面部编辑基准测试中，LPIPS得分为0.001，SSIM为0.992；在LSUN-Bedroom和LSUN-Church数据集上分别比RF-Inversion提高了7.8%和12.9%的重建损失；在语义面部编辑中，身份保留提升了11.2%，感知质量提升了1.6%。

Conclusion: OTIP框架通过最优传输理论在逆向扩散过程中平衡了重建精度和编辑可控性，实现了高保真重建和细节保留，同时在多个编辑任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 该研究提出了TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道，用于在多样化港口环境中高效识别运输单元，支持物流链的数字化转型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口物流中运输单元（TUs）的识别效率低下，且缺乏公开的基准数据集来捕捉真实港口环境的多样性和动态性。

Method: 研究提出了TITUS管道，分为三个阶段：(1)分割运输单元实例，(2)检测ID文本位置，(3)识别和验证提取的ID。

Result: TITUS能够从多种相机视角及不同光照和天气条件下可靠地识别TUs，TRUDI数据集为开发新方法提供了基准。

Conclusion: 通过公开TRUDI数据集和提出TITUS管道，该研究为多用途港口的数字化转型提供了支持，并提升了整个物流链的效率。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Motivation: 当前布局生成方法存在任务特定性生成能力和感知不一致的评估指标问题，导致应用受限和测量无效。

Method: 提出Uni-Layout框架，包括统一生成器（支持自然语言提示）、基于Layout-HF100k数据集的人类反馈评估器（结合视觉和几何信息，采用Chain-of-Thought机制和置信度估计模块），以及动态边缘偏好优化（DMPO）实现生成器与评估器的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，Uni-Layout在布局生成任务中显著优于任务特定和通用方法。

Conclusion: Uni-Layout通过统一的生成框架、模仿人类的评估器以及动态调整的偏好优化，显著提升了布局生成的性能，超越了任务特定和通用方法。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Conclusion: SMART-Ship 数据集能够支持多种多模态遥感解释任务，并为未来探索指明了方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

TL;DR: COLER是一种简单有效的无监督实例分割和对象检测方法，通过一次性生成伪标签并学习，无需复杂聚类或专用损失函数，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出COLER旨在简化无监督实例分割和对象检测的过程，通过一次性生成伪标签并学习，避免复杂聚类和专用损失函数的设计。

Method: COLER首先使用开发的CutOnce生成粗伪标签，然后让检测器从这些掩码中学习。CutOnce仅应用一次归一化切割，不依赖任何聚类方法，但可以生成图像中的多个对象掩码。设计了几个新颖而简单的模块，使CutOnce能充分利用自监督模型的对象发现能力，并摆脱对掩码后处理的依赖。

Result: COLER在训练中无需专门设计的伪标签损失函数即可实现强劲性能，并通过自训练进一步改进，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: COLER是一种零样本无监督模型，在多个基准测试中优于先前的最先进方法，有助于推动无监督对象定位领域的发展。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在目标幻觉问题上存在严重缺陷，研究发现其不仅忽视视觉信息，还可能忽视文本模态，导致对用户指令的碎片化理解。

Method: 通过干预和调整视觉与文本标记的注意力权重，平衡跨模态兼容性，并结合对比解码策略减少对参数知识的过度依赖。

Result: 实验证实了模态偏见在LVLMs中的普遍存在，提出的方法在多个开源LVLMs和基准测试中有效缓解了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中存在的模态偏见现象，并提出了一种无需训练的方法来缓解目标幻觉问题。实验证明了该方法的广泛适用性和有效性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

TL;DR: 提出无需分割的ViT模型预测胶质母细胞瘤生存期，准确率62.5%，性能平衡，但数据集规模限制泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性的脑肿瘤，预测总体生存期（OS）对个性化治疗策略至关重要。传统方法依赖肿瘤分割，计算资源需求高。

Method: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformers（ViTs）的新型AI方法，直接从MRI图像中提取特征，无需肿瘤分割。

Result: 在BRATS数据集上测试，准确率达62.5%，性能平衡（精度、召回率、F1分数），优于其他模型。但因数据集规模限制，ViT的泛化能力受限。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了Vision Transformers（ViTs）在医学影像任务中的适用性，为无需分割的高效计算OS预测模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

Motivation: 针对SAM在密集同质对象分割中的意图差距问题，即无法从稀疏提示推广到语义相关实例，提出改进方案。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，通过偏好优化使模型能够从稀疏视觉交互中推断高级类别意图，无需依赖语言模型。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务中，SAMPO仅用10%的训练数据即达到最先进性能，在PanNuke-T2任务中比基线提升超过9个百分点。

Conclusion: SAMPO通过偏好优化框架，成功解决了视觉基础模型在稀疏提示下难以捕捉高级语义意图的问题，为医学图像分割等领域提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

TL;DR: FMS网络通过多模态监督机制提升伪造检测性能，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因忽视不可靠单模态数据的干扰和缺乏全面的伪造监督，导致性能受限。FMS网络旨在通过多层次的监督机制解决这些问题。

Method: FMS网络包含三个模块：Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC)、Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR)和Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR)，分别处理模态可靠性监督、单模态内部监督和跨模态监督。

Result: 实验表明，FMS网络在DGM$^4$检测任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMS网络通过整合模态可靠性监督、单模态内部监督和跨模态监督，显著提升了DGM$^4$检测的性能，并在实验中优于现有方法。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的多镜头fMRI视频重建方法，通过信号分解和语义字幕生成，显著提高了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法仅限于单镜头视频重建，无法处理现实世界中的多镜头体验，存在信号混合、时间分辨率不匹配和缺乏专用数据集等挑战。

Method: 研究提出了一个分而治之的解码框架，包括三个核心创新：镜头边界预测模块、生成性关键帧字幕和大型数据合成。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的多镜头fMRI视频重建框架，通过明确的信号分解和语义提示，能够准确恢复复杂的视觉叙事。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

TL;DR: EFA-GS通过频率域分析和动态优化策略，有效减少3D高斯泼溅中的浮动伪影，提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在低质量初始化场景下常产生浮动伪影，影响视觉质量，但其成因尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了EFA-GS方法，通过选择性扩展优化不足的高斯分布以优先学习低频信息，并引入基于深度和尺度的动态细化策略。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，EFA-GS显著减少了浮动伪影，PSNR提升了1.68 dB。

Conclusion: EFA-GS有效减少了3D高斯泼溅中的浮动伪影，同时保持了高频细节，并在下游3D编辑任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

TL;DR: ReMake通过实例掩码和单目深度估计改进透明物体的深度补全，提升准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的光学特性导致深度相机生成不完整或无效的深度数据，现有方法依赖模型隐式推理深度值可靠性，泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出ReMake框架，结合实例掩码和单目深度估计，明确区分透明与非透明区域，专注于从RGB-D输入中学习透明区域的深度估计。

Result: 在基准数据集和真实场景中，ReMake方法均优于现有方法，展示了更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ReMake框架通过实例掩码和单目深度估计的引导，显著提高了深度补全的准确性和泛化能力，尤其在透明物体场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着短格式视频平台上用户生成内容（UGC）的快速增长，视频参与度预测对于优化推荐系统和指导内容创作变得越来越重要。然而，由于语义内容、视觉质量、音频特性和用户背景等多因素的复杂相互作用，这一任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 研究采用两种代表性的LMMs：整合音频、视觉和语言模态的VideoLLaMA2，以及仅建模视觉和语言模态的Qwen2.5-VL。VideoLLaMA2联合处理关键视频帧、基于文本的元数据和背景声音，而Qwen2.5-VL仅利用关键视频帧和基于文本的元数据。两种模型均在SnapUGC数据集上进行训练。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究艺术斑马线对基于视觉的行人检测模型性能的影响，特别是其视觉复杂性是否干扰监控系统。

Method: 通过将各种街头艺术图案合成到固定监控场景中，评估预训练视觉对象检测模型在普通和对抗性艺术斑马线下的行人检测性能。

Result: 简单色彩设计影响较小，但复杂艺术图案（尤其是高视觉显著性）会显著降低检测性能；对抗性设计可故意遮挡真实行人或生成虚假检测。

Conclusion: 艺术斑马线可能影响基于视觉的行人检测系统性能，尤其是在复杂或对抗性设计下，这揭示了城市监控系统在设计时需要考虑环境视觉变化的弱点。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

TL;DR: PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别，提升车辆检测准确性并大幅降低带宽需求，适用于不同带宽条件的智能交通系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中，实时视频传输的带宽限制会导致通信瓶颈，而传统压缩技术会降低视频质量，影响车辆检测准确性。环境因素（如天气和光照）进一步加剧了这一挑战。

Method: 采用Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC)框架，根据天气和光照条件动态调整视频压缩级别，以优化带宽使用和检测准确性。

Result: PAVC在中等带宽区域将车辆检测准确性提升13%，带宽需求降低8.23倍；在带宽严重受限区域，带宽需求降低72倍且保持检测性能。

Conclusion: PAVC框架通过动态调整视频压缩级别，有效平衡了带宽使用和车辆检测准确性，在智能交通系统中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法面临多样性不足、误差累积、物理不合理性（生成模型）以及扩散惯性、部分模式崩溃和异步伪影（RAG 方法）等双重挑战。

Method: ReMoMask 框架整合了三个关键创新：1) 双向动量文本-运动模型，通过动量队列解耦负样本规模与批量大小；2) 语义时空注意力机制，在部分级融合中强化生物力学约束；3) RAG-无分类指导，通过少量无条件生成增强泛化能力。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ReMoMask 在 HumanML3D 和 KIT-ML 上的 FID 分数分别比之前的 SOTA 方法 RAG-T2M 提高了 3.88% 和 10.97%。

Conclusion: ReMoMask 是一个集成了双向动量文本-运动模型、语义时空注意力机制和 RAG-无分类指导的统一框架，显著提升了文本到运动生成的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在VQA任务中表现出色，但现有评估方法往往忽略性能方差，无法全面反映模型的实际表现。

Method: 通过分析14个广泛使用的VQA基准，系统研究了训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和扩展指令微调对性能变异的影响，并探索了Cloze-style评估作为替代策略的效果。

Result: 研究发现当前评估方法存在显著局限性，提出方差感知方法可促进MLLMs的更稳健发展。

Conclusion: 当前对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉问答（VQA）基准上的评估方法存在局限性，需要采用考虑方差的方法来提升评估的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

Motivation: 当前动态重建方法主要局限于短期、小规模变形，且物理一致性考虑有限。PMGS旨在解决大时空跨度复杂刚体运动的建模挑战。

Method: PMGS采用两阶段工作流程：1)目标建模：通过动态场景分解和改进的点密度控制实现对象集中重建；2)运动恢复：通过学习每帧SE(3)姿态恢复完整运动序列。引入加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略，并设计卡尔曼融合方案优化误差。

Result: 实验表明，PMGS在重建高速非线性刚体运动方面优于主流动态方法。

Conclusion: PMGS在重建高速非线性刚体运动方面表现出色，优于主流动态方法。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学领域缺乏开源、可复现的推理型大模型构建方案的问题，推动社区研究。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）和基于答案正确性的强化学习（RLVR）两种训练范式，结合系统化数据筛选（文本与多模态）。

Result: RLVR显著优于SFT；仅使用文本推理数据的训练效果反超多模态数据；7B模型在公开基准上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: MedVLThinker通过开放数据和训练范式（特别是RLVR）为医学推理研究提供了强大基础，其7B模型在公开VQA基准上达到新SOTA，32B模型性能媲美GPT-4o。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Motivation: 现有数据增强策略依赖外部知识，成本高且忽略图像模态特征，AugPT旨在利用内部数据增强更高效地利用已知特征。

Method: 提出AugPT方法，利用自监督增强和基于共识测试的门控机制，过滤噪声样本，优化增强视图质量。

Result: 实验证明AugPT在不依赖外部知识的情况下，显著提升了模型性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: AugPT通过仅使用内部数据增强和自监督学习，有效提升了CLIP模型的性能和泛化能力，无需依赖外部知识。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

Method: TestWeaver 结合了三种创新方法：(1) 使用目标行的后向切片而非完整程序上下文；(2) 引入共享控制流相似性的“近邻测试用例”；(3) 通过行内注释增强LLM的推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，TestWeaver 在加速代码覆盖率增长和生成更有效的回归测试用例方面优于现有基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: TestWeaver 通过集成轻量级程序分析和创新方法，有效提升了基于LLM的回归测试生成效果，克服了覆盖率平台现象。

Abstract: Regression testing ensures that code changes do not unintentionally break
existing functionality. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)
have shown promise in automating test generation for regression testing, they
often suffer from limited reasoning about program execution, resulting in
stagnated coverage growth - a phenomenon known as the coverage plateau. In this
paper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates
lightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.
TestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and
improves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target
line instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close
test cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the
target line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and
(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode
variable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these
targeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test
generation and mitigates redundant explorations. Empirical results demonstrate
that TestWeaver accelerates code coverage growth and generates more effective
regression test cases than existing LLM-based approaches.

*Wei Liu,Linqiang Guo,Yi Wen Heng,Chenglin Li,Tse-Hsun,Chen,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种通过移动屏幕录像直接测量GUI响应性的技术，能有效检测用户交互和视觉延迟，已在工业测试中成功应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI响应性对于移动应用的用户体验至关重要。即使短暂的视觉反馈延迟也可能让用户感到沮丧并导致负面评价。然而，检测和量化这种用户感知延迟仍然具有挑战性，尤其是在工业测试管道中。

Method: 本文提出了一种轻量级黑盒技术，直接从移动屏幕录像中测量GUI响应性。该技术利用计算机视觉检测用户交互，并通过分析帧级视觉变化计算两个关键指标：响应时间（从用户操作到首次视觉反馈）和完成时间（直到视觉反馈稳定）。

Result: 该工具在一个手动标注的基准测试中表现出色，检测交互的精度和召回率分别为0.96和0.93，对于超过89%的交互，测量响应时间和完成时间的误差分别在50毫秒和100毫秒以内。

Conclusion: 该工具已在工业测试管道中部署，每天分析数千个屏幕录像，发现了传统工具遗漏的响应性问题，并提高了性能调试效率。

Abstract: GUI responsiveness is critical for a positive user experience in mobile
applications. Even brief delays in visual feedback can frustrate users and lead
to negative reviews. However, detecting and quantifying such user-perceived
delays remains challenging, especially in industrial testing pipelines that
evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions.
Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful,
may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively.
  In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box
technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts --
video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user
interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance
issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user
interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key
metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish
time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually
annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool
achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures
response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for
over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing
pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness
issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging
efficiency.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合LLM语义分析和执行验证的两阶段框架，有效提升了Python程序中语义克隆的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉功能等价性，尤其是语义克隆（Type 4），而直接应用LLM由于对语法差异敏感效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段框架：第一阶段使用LLM筛选明显非克隆的代码对；第二阶段对未识别的代码对进行基于执行的验证，利用LLM生成的测试输入评估功能等价性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在精确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于直接基于LLM的检测方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种结合LLM筛选与执行验证的两阶段框架，显著提升了语义克隆检测的准确率，未来将探索跨语言检测和大规模优化。

Abstract: Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at
identifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software
systems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence,
particularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement
identical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances
in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code
semantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields
suboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines
LLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic
clones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to
filter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not
identified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation
approach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence
through cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates
significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct
LLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying
semantic clones. Future work includes exploring cross-language clone detection
and optimizing the framework for large-scale applications.

TL;DR: 该论文首次实证验证了基于控制理论的Composite Stability Index (CSI)，通过优化测量方法和统计推断，提升了开源项目稳定性评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件在全球软件供应链中的重要性日益增加，但其稳定性和可持续性的测量方法缺乏实证验证。

Method: 通过实验验证了100个高排名GitHub仓库，比较了每日与每周提交频率的稳定性测量，并改进了统计推断方法（如用中位数代替均值）。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 每周提交频率比每日更可行；(2) 使用中位数优化了问题和拉取请求的稳定性指数；(3) 推导了更符合实际项目行为的数据驱动参数。

Conclusion: 该研究证实了控制理论在开源项目稳定性评估中的可行性，并提供了基于实证数据的优化参数，为实际项目监控工具提供了依据。

Abstract: Over the past few decades, open source software has been continuously
integrated into software supply chains worldwide, drastically increasing
reliance and dependence. Because of the role this software plays, it is
important to understand ways to measure and promote its stability and potential
for sustainability. Recent work proposed the use of control theory to
understand repository stability and evaluate repositories' ability to return to
equilibrium after a disturbance such as the introduction of a new feature
request, a spike in bug reports, or even the influx or departure of
contributors. This approach leverages commit frequency patterns, issue
resolution rate, pull request merge rate, and community activity engagement to
provide a Composite Stability Index (CSI). While this framework has theoretical
foundations, there is no empirical validation of the CSI in practice. In this
paper, we present the first empirical validation of the proposed CSI by
experimenting with 100 highly ranked GitHub repositories. Our results suggest
that (1) sampling weekly commit frequency pattern instead of daily is a more
feasible measure of commit frequency stability across repositories and (2)
improved statistical inferences (swapping mean with median), particularly with
ascertaining resolution and review times in issues and pull request, improves
the overall issue and pull request stability index. Drawing on our empirical
dataset, we also derive data-driven half-width parameters that better align
stability scores with real project behavior. These findings both confirm the
viability of a control-theoretic lens on open-source health and provide
concrete, evidence-backed applications for real-world project monitoring tools.

TL;DR: 研究发现，技术卓越可能因与可用性、透明度和用户信任冲突而阻碍工具采用。TMLL通过采用为中心的设计解决了这一问题，验证了认知兼容性、嵌入专业知识和透明信任的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代系统中，系统追踪对理解复杂软件行为至关重要，但高级追踪分析工具在工业环境中的采用面临显著障碍。

Method: 通过与Ericsson Montreal长达一年的合作，开发了TMLL（Trace-Server Machine Learning Library），并调查了40名行业和学术专业人士的反馈。

Result: 调查显示，77.5%的人优先考虑结果的质量和信任而非技术复杂性，67.5%偏好半自动化分析并保留用户控制权。结果验证了三个核心原则：认知兼容性、嵌入专业知识和基于透明的信任。

Conclusion: 可持续采用需要重新定位为以采用为中心的设计，对自动化软件工程工具有实际意义。

Abstract: System tracing has become essential for understanding complex software
behavior in modern systems, yet sophisticated trace analysis tools face
significant adoption gaps in industrial settings. Through a year-long
collaboration with Ericsson Montr\'eal, developing TMLL (Trace-Server Machine
Learning Library, now in the Eclipse Foundation), we investigated barriers to
trace analysis adoption. Contrary to assumptions about complexity or automation
needs, practitioners struggled with translating expert knowledge into
actionable insights, integrating analysis into their workflows, and trusting
automated results they could not validate. We identified what we called the
Excellence Paradox: technical excellence can actively impede adoption when
conflicting with usability, transparency, and practitioner trust. TMLL
addresses this through adoption-focused design that embeds expert knowledge in
interfaces, provides transparent explanations, and enables incremental
adoption. Validation through Ericsson's experts' feedback, Eclipse Foundation's
integration, and a survey of 40 industry and academic professionals revealed
consistent patterns: survey results showed that 77.5% prioritize quality and
trust in results over technical sophistication, while 67.5% prefer
semi-automated analysis with user control, findings supported by qualitative
feedback from industrial collaboration and external peer review. Results
validate three core principles: cognitive compatibility, embedded expertise,
and transparency-based trust. This challenges conventional capability-focused
tool development, demonstrating that sustainable adoption requires
reorientation toward adoption-focused design with actionable implications for
automated software engineering tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业平台部署多个LLM时，针对一个LLM优化的提示往往在其他LLM上失败，导致高昂的模型特定提示工程成本，限制了多LLM优化系统的实际部署。

Method: MPCO利用元提示技术动态合成上下文感知的优化提示，整合项目元数据、任务需求和LLM特定上下文，并在ARTEMIS工业平台上进行自动化验证和扩展。

Result: 在五个真实代码库上进行的评估显示，MPCO实现了高达19.06%的性能提升，96%的顶级优化来自有意义的编辑。

Conclusion: MPCO框架通过元提示技术有效解决了多LLM系统中的提示工程瓶颈，显著提升了代码优化性能，并提供了对工业实践有价值的见解。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple
LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with
others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model
prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of
multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we
introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that
automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs
while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages
meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by
integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and
it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated
validation and scaling.
  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of
runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall
performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all
systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the
top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic
ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that
comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting,
and that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters,
providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.

Motivation: 现有语法驱动的测试生成方法难以高效达成特定测试目标，FdLoop旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FdLoop采用迭代方法，结合测试反馈和概率语法，动态学习和调整输入分布，以生成针对特定目标的测试输入。

Result: 在86%的测试场景中，FdLoop优于五种基线方法，且在诱发错误行为方面效果是最好基线方法的两倍。

Conclusion: FdLoop通过迭代学习和反馈机制，显著提高了针对特定测试目标的输入生成效率，在多种测试场景下表现优于现有基线方法，尤其在诱发错误行为方面效果显著。

Abstract: To effectively test complex software, it is important to generate
goal-specific inputs, i.e., inputs that achieve a specific testing goal.
However, most state-of-the-art test generators are not designed to target
specific goals. Notably, grammar-based test generators, which (randomly)
produce syntactically valid inputs via an input specification (i.e., grammar)
have a low probability of achieving an arbitrary testing goal. This work
addresses this challenge by proposing an automated test generation approach
(called FdLoop) which iteratively learns relevant input properties from
existing inputs to drive the generation of goal-specific inputs. Given a
testing goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input
distribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic
grammar. We concretize FdLoop for four testing goals, namely unique code
coverage, input-to-code complexity, program failures (exceptions) and long
execution time. We evaluate FdLoop using three (3) well-known input formats
(JSON, CSS and JavaScript) and 20 open-source software. In most (86%) settings,
FdLoop outperforms all five tested baselines namely the baseline grammar-based
test generators (random, probabilistic and inverse-probabilistic methods),
EvoGFuzz and DynaMosa. FdLoop is (up to) twice (2X) as effective as the best
baseline (EvoGFuzz) in inducing erroneous behaviors. In addition, we show that
the main components of FdLoop (i.e., input mutator, grammar mutator and test
feedbacks) contribute positively to its effectiveness. Finally, our evaluation
demonstrates that FdLoop effectively achieves single testing goals (revealing
erroneous behaviors, generating complex inputs, or inducing long execution
time) and scales to multiple testing goals across varying parameter settings.

TL;DR: OpenLambdaVerse通过分析使用Serverless Framework的GitHub仓库，提供了对当前无服务器架构状态的深入理解，包括应用规模、语言使用和安全实践等方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无服务器计算的快速发展，需要对这些工具在实际项目中的使用情况进行更新的洞察。

Method: 基于Wonderless数据集的方法论，应用多个新的过滤步骤，创建了一个使用Serverless Framework的GitHub仓库数据集，并对其进行了分析和特征描述。

Result: 通过分析，获得了关于当前应用程序的规模和复杂性、使用的语言和运行时、函数的触发方式、项目的成熟度以及其安全实践（或缺乏）的重要见解。

Conclusion: OpenLambdaVerse提供了一个有价值的、最新的资源，帮助从业者和研究人员更好地理解不断演变的无服务器工作负载。

Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is at the core of serverless computing, enabling
developers to easily deploy applications without managing computing resources.
With an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, frameworks like the Serverless
Framework use YAML configurations to define and deploy APIs, tasks, workflows,
and event-driven applications on cloud providers, promoting zero-friction
development. As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for
updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building
on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless
computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse
addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that
use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS
Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an
understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this
stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and
complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ,
how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their
security practices (or lack of). OpenLambdaVerse thus offers a valuable,
up-to-date resource for both practitioners and researchers that seek to better
understand evolving serverless workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在代码生成方面已被广泛研究，但它们在代码修改中的作用仍较少被理解，特别是在构建有效提示方面的挑战。

Method: 本研究探索了两种提示策略：直接指令提示和摘要中介提示，并通过15名开发者在多种场景下的任务完成情况进行研究。

Result: 研究发现开发者采用迭代工作流程，两种提示策略各有优劣：直接指令提示更灵活且易于指定，而摘要中介提示则支持理解、提示支架和控制。

Conclusion: 本研究强调需要更易用的提示交互方式，包括可调整的摘要粒度、可靠的摘要-代码可追溯性以及生成摘要的一致性。

Abstract: This paper presents a study of using large language models (LLMs) in
modifying existing code. While LLMs for generating code have been widely
studied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although
"prompting" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate
intents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification
introduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that
natural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches
have been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study
investigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:
Direct Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in
free-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by
editing the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study
with 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques
across multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an
iterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating
outputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy
presented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier
to specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt
scaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task
goals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and
code familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt
interactions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code
traceability, and consistency in generated summaries.

Abstract: Training software engineering (SWE) LLMs is bottlenecked by expensive
infrastructure, inefficient evaluation pipelines, scarce training data, and
costly quality control. We present RepoForge, an autonomous, end-to-end
pipeline that generates, evaluates, and trains SWE agents at scale. Our key
contributions include: (1) RepoForge-8B-Agent, achieving 17.4\% on
SWE-Bench-Verified~\citep{swebench_verified2024}, establishing new
state-of-the-art for $\leq$8B non-thinking LLMs; (2) 7,304 executable
environments auto-generated from real GitHub commits with zero manual

faster evaluation using a Ray-powered~\citep{ray2018} distributed RepoForge
harness; (5) 19,000$\times$ cheaper labeling through our automated
SPICE~\citep{spice2024} difficulty assessment technique. By unifying
storage-efficient sandboxing, Ray-powered evaluation harness, automated data
generation, SPICE-based labeling, and bubble-free RL scaffold, we demonstrate
that even $\leq$8B models can reach new state-of-the-art performance on
demanding benchmarks like SWE-Bench-Verified. Our approach addresses critical
bottlenecks in SWE agent training: high storage costs of container-based
evaluation, inefficient sequential reward pipelines, limited availability of
high-quality training data, expensive manual labeling, and multi-turn RL
pipeline bottlenecks.

Abstract: Flow-sensitive pointer analysis constitutes an essential component of precise
program analysis for accurately modeling pointer behaviors by incorporating
control flows. Flow-sensitive pointer analysis is extensively used in alias
analysis, taint analysis, program understanding, compiler optimization, etc.
Existing flow-sensitive pointer analysis approaches, which are conducted based
on control flow graphs, have significantly advanced the precision of pointer
analysis via sophisticated techniques to leverage control flow information.
However, they inevitably suffer from computational inefficiencies when
resolving points-to information due to the inherent complex structures of
control flow graphs. We present CG-FSPTA, a Flow-Sensitive Constraint Graph
(FSConsG) based flow-sensitive pointer analysis to overcome the inefficiency of
control-flow-graph-based analysis. CG-FSPTA uses a flow-sensitive variant to
leverage the structural advantages of set-constraint graphs (which are commonly
used in flow-insensitive pointer analysis) while keeping the flow sensitivity
of variable definitions and uses, allowing the incorporation of sophisticated
graph optimization and dynamic solving techniques. In this way, CG-FSPTA
achieves significant efficiency improvements while keeping the precision of
flow-sensitive analysis. Experimental evaluations on benchmark programs
demonstrate that CG-FSPTA, significantly reduces both memory usage and
execution time while maintaining precision. In particular, by solving in the
FSConsG, CG-FSPTA achieves an average memory reduction of 33.05\% and
accelerates flow-sensitive pointer analysis by 7.27x compared to the
state-of-art method. These experimental results underscore the efficacy of
CG-FSPTA as a scalable solution to analyze large-scale software systems,
establishing a robust foundation for future advancements in efficient program
analysis frameworks.

*Huashan Lei,Guanping Xiao,Yepang Liu,Zheng Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PCREQ是一种自动化推断Python第三方库兼容需求的方法，结合版本和代码兼容性分析，显著提升成功率并减少手动工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python第三方库（TPLs）升级常导致兼容性问题，现有工具主要检测依赖冲突而忽视代码级不兼容，缺乏自动化解决方案。

Method: PCREQ整合了六个模块：知识获取、版本兼容性评估、调用API和模块提取、代码兼容性评估、版本变更和缺失TPL补全，通过迭代调整版本生成兼容的requirements.txt。

Result: PCREQ在REQBench基准测试中达到94.03%的推断成功率，平均处理每个案例耗时60.79秒，显著优于其他工具。

Conclusion: PCREQ显著减少了Python依赖升级中的手动调试工作，推动了依赖维护的自动化进程。

Abstract: Python third-party libraries (TPLs) are essential in modern software
development, but upgrades often cause compatibility issues, leading to system
failures. These issues fall into two categories: version compatibility issues
(VCIs) and code compatibility issues (CCIs). Existing tools mainly detect
dependency conflicts but overlook code-level incompatibilities, with no
solution fully automating the inference of compatible versions for both VCIs
and CCIs. To fill this gap, we propose PCREQ, the first approach to
automatically infer compatible requirements by combining version and code
compatibility analysis. PCREQ integrates six modules: knowledge acquisition,
version compatibility assessment, invoked APIs and modules extraction, code
compatibility assessment, version change, and missing TPL completion. PCREQ
collects candidate versions, checks for conflicts, identifies API usage,
evaluates code compatibility, and iteratively adjusts versions to generate a
compatible requirements.txt with a detailed repair report. To evaluate PCREQ,
we construct REQBench, a large-scale benchmark with 2,095 upgrade test cases
(including 406 unsolvable by pip). Results show PCREQ achieves a 94.03%
inference success rate, outperforming PyEGo (37.02%), ReadPyE (37.16%), and
LLM-based approaches (GPT-4o, DeepSeek V3/R1) by 18-20%. PCREQ processes each
case from REQBench in 60.79s on average, demonstrating practical efficiency.
PCREQ significantly reduces manual effort in troubleshooting upgrades,

Motivation: 开放世界视频游戏的广阔搜索空间为测试自动化带来了挑战，需要一种能够有效生成新输入的方法来发现故障。

Method: BiFuzz是一个两阶段的模糊测试工具，通过逐步变异游戏策略和测试案例（包括实际移动路径）来生成新输入。

Result: BiFuzz成功变异了游戏策略和测试案例，能够检测到'卡顿'故障。

Conclusion: BiFuzz能够有效检测开放世界视频游戏中的'卡顿'故障，展示了其在自动化测试中的潜力。

Abstract: Open-world video games present a broader search space than other games,
posing challenges for test automation. Fuzzing, which generates new inputs by
mutating an initial input, is commonly used to uncover failures. In this study,
we proposed BiFuzz, a two-stage fuzzer designed for automated testing of
open-world video games, and investigated its effectiveness. The results
revealed that BiFuzz mutated the overall strategy of gameplay and test cases,
including actual movement paths, step by step. Consequently, BiFuzz can detect
`stucking' failures. The tool and its video are at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模块化CGRA编译框架，通过编译级别的控制流优化，支持广泛应用程序并实现高性能，比现有方法最高加速2.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CGRA编译面临的主要障碍是多维空间（空间和时间域）的复杂性，现有编译器大多仅处理数据流，对控制流支持有限。本文旨在通过编译级别的控制流优化，提升CGRA的适用范围和性能。

Method: 提出了一种模块化编译框架，包括转换和优化通道，支持在抽象CGRA网格上运行具有任意控制流的应用程序。并引入了一种新颖的映射方法作为编译后端，解决CGRA硬件资源限制。

Result: 框架通过纯编译优化，比现有方法实现了最高2.1倍的加速。

Conclusion: 通过编译级别的控制流管理和优化，本文的方法能够在硬件无关的情况下实现高性能，支持广泛的应用程序。

Abstract: Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) present both high flexibility
and efficiency, making them well-suited for the acceleration of intensive
workloads. Nevertheless, a key barrier towards their widespread adoption is
posed by CGRA compilation, which must cope with a multi-dimensional space
spanning both the spatial and the temporal domains. Indeed, state-of-the-art
compilers are limited in scope as they mostly deal with the data flow of
applications, while having little or no support for control flow. Hence, they
mostly target the mapping of single loops and/or delegate the management of
control flow divergences to ad-hoc hardware units.
  Conversely, in this paper we show that control flow can be effectively
managed and optimized at the compilation level, allowing for a broad set of
applications to be targeted while being hardware-agnostic and achieving high
performance. We embody our methodology in a modular compilation framework
consisting of transformation and optimization passes, enabling support for
applications with arbitrary control flows running on abstract CGRA meshes. We
also introduce a novel mapping methodology that acts as a compilation back-end,
addressing the limitations in available CGRA hardware resources and
guaranteeing a feasible solution in the compilation process. Our framework
achieves up to 2.1X speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, purely through
compilation optimizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试方法（通常通过CLI执行）与HIDE工具隔离，导致开发流程中断，超过关键注意力阈值。

Method: 提出一个库，提供测试的运行时表示，实现与HIDE工具的紧密集成，并在测试失败时即时访问HIDE工具。

Result: 实现了亚秒级的测试重新执行时间，对保持开发者专注至关重要。

Conclusion: 集成测试与HIDE工具可以显著提升开发效率，保持开发者的注意力集中。

Abstract: Highly interactive development environments (HIDEs) enable uninterrupted
development flow through continuous program evolution and rapid hypothesis
checking. However, traditional testing approaches -- typically executed
separately via CLI -- isolate tests from HIDE tooling (interactive debuggers,
value and stack inspectors, etc.) and introduce disruptive delays due to coarse
execution granularity and lack of runtime context. This disconnect breaks
development flow by exceeding critical attention thresholds. In this paper we
present a library that provides runtime representation for tests, allowing
tight integration with HIDEs, and enabling immediate access to HIDE tooling in
the context of test failure. We then describe development workflows enhanced
with testing and demonstrate how they achieve subsecond test reexecution times
crucial for maintaining developer focus.

Result: 识别了15种方法学方法、9种主要威胁和25种缓解策略，并提出了PRIMES 2.0框架。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了PRIMES 2.0框架，为基于LLM的MSR研究提供了透明和可重复的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering
research, offering new opportunities for automating repository mining tasks.
However, despite their growing popularity, the methodological integration of
LLMs into Mining Software Repositories (MSR) remains poorly understood.
Existing studies tend to focus on specific capabilities or performance
benchmarks, providing limited insight into how researchers utilize LLMs across
the full research pipeline. To address this gap, we conduct a mixed-method
study that combines a rapid review and questionnaire survey in the field of
LLM4MSR. We investigate (1) the approaches and (2) the threats that affect the
empirical rigor of researchers involved in this field. Our findings reveal 15
methodological approaches, nine main threats, and 25 mitigation strategies.
Building on these findings, we present PRIMES 2.0, a refined empirical
framework organized into six stages, comprising 23 methodological substeps,
each mapped to specific threats and corresponding mitigation strategies,
providing prescriptive and adaptive support throughout the lifecycle of
LLM-based MSR studies. Our work contributes to establishing a more transparent
and reproducible foundation for LLM-based MSR research.

this field while also discussing its future directions. With the advancement of
large language models, the core technologies underlying dialogue systems have
significantly progressed. As a result, dialogue system technology is now

contexts. To achieve this, it is important to build, operate, and continuously
improve dialogue systems correctly and efficiently. Accordingly, in addition to
applying existing software engineering knowledge, it is becoming increasingly
important to evolve software engineering tailored specifically to dialogue
systems. In this paper, we enumerate the knowledge areas of dialogue systems
engineering based on those of software engineering, as defined in the Software
Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Version 4.0, and survey each area. Based
on this survey, we identify unexplored topics in each area and discuss the

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出基于VLM的测试方法RVSG，用于生成多样化违反安全要求的人类行为场景，在模拟器中验证其有效性，揭示AMR不确定性行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类行为不可预测且AMR可能未经过训练处理所有未知和不确定行为，需在多样化人类交互下测试AMR以确保其安全行为。实际环境中测试成本高、不切实际且可能危险。

Method: 基于功能和安全要求，利用VLM生成违反这些要求的多样化人类行为，并在模拟器中评估RVSG与PAL Robotics的最新AMR。

Result: 与基线相比，RVSG能有效生成违反要求的场景，并增加机器人行为的变异性，有助于揭示其不确定性行为。

Conclusion: RVSG是一种有效的基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的测试方法，能够生成多样化的违反功能和安全要求的人类行为场景，从而揭示AMR的不确定性行为。

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are deployed in diverse environments (e.g.,
warehouses, retail spaces, and offices), where they work alongside humans.
Given that human behavior can be unpredictable and that AMRs may not have been
trained to handle all possible unknown and uncertain behaviors, it is important
to test AMRs under a wide range of human interactions to ensure their safe
behavior. Moreover, testing in real environments with actual AMRs and humans is
often costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous (e.g., it could result in
human injury). To this end, we propose a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based
testing approach (RVSG) for industrial AMRs developed by PAL Robotics in Spain.
Based on the functional and safety requirements, RVSG uses the VLM to generate
diverse human behaviors that violate these requirements. We evaluated RVSG with
several requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR
from PAL Robotics. Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can
effectively generate requirement-violating scenarios. Moreover, RVSG-generated
scenarios increase variability in robot behavior, thereby helping reveal their
uncertain behaviors.

TL;DR: JC-Finder是一种高效的Java克隆检测工具，专门识别第三方库重用，性能优于现有工具，并能发现更多未声明的TPL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第三方库（TPL）的重用虽然促进了软件开发，但其混乱的管理带来了维护威胁和版权问题。目前缺乏专门为Java设计的基于克隆的SCA工具，且现有工具直接应用存在问题。

Method: JC-Finder通过捕获类级别的特征、维护函数间关系并排除琐碎或重复元素，实现了对Java项目中TPL重用的准确和高效识别。

Result: JC-Finder在9,965个Maven库和1,000个GitHub项目上的测试中，F1-score达到0.818，速度比现有工具快约9倍。进一步应用于7,947个GitHub项目，发现789个项目存在TPL重用，检测到2,142个TPL，其中26.20%未在包管理器中声明。

Conclusion: JC-Finder是一种新型的基于克隆的SCA工具，专门为Java项目设计，能够准确、高效地识别由源代码克隆引入的第三方库重用实例。实验结果表明，JC-Finder在F1-score和速度上均优于现有工具，并能检测到更多未在包管理器中明确声明的TPL。

Abstract: While reusing third-party libraries (TPL) facilitates software development,
its chaotic management has brought great threats to software maintenance and
the unauthorized use of source code also raises ethical problems such as
misconduct on copyrighted code. To identify TPL reuse in projects, Software
Composition Analysis (SCA) is employed, and two categories of SCA techniques
are used based on how TPLs are introduced: clone-based SCA and
package-manager-based SCA (PM-based SCA). Although introducing TPLs by clones
is prevalent in Java, no clone-based SCA tools are specially designed for Java.
Also, directly applying clone-based SCA techniques from other tools is
problematic. To fill this gap, we introduce JC-Finder, a novel clone-based SCA
tool that aims to accurately and comprehensively identify instances of TPL
reuse introduced by source code clones in Java projects. JC-Finder achieves
both accuracy and efficiency in identifying TPL reuse from code cloning by
capturing features at the class level, maintaining inter-function
relationships, and excluding trivial or duplicated elements. To evaluate the
efficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as
reference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects. The result
shows that JC-Finder achieved an F1-score of 0.818, outperforming the other
function-level tool by 0.427. The average time taken for resolving TPL reuse is
14.2 seconds, which is approximately 9 times faster than the other tool. We
further applied JC-Finder to 7,947 GitHub projects, revealing TPL reuse by code
clones in 789 projects (about 9.89% of all projects) and identifying a total of
2,142 TPLs. JC-Finder successfully detects 26.20% more TPLs that are not
explicitly declared in package managers.

Motivation: 机器人软件升级后回归测试的挑战在于测试预言（预期正确行为）的确定，尤其是在未知环境中操作时。机器学习（ML）为基础的测试预言是可行方案。

Method: 提出混合框架QuReBot，结合量子储层计算（QRC）和简单神经网络（受残差连接启发），预测机器人预期行为。

Result: QRC单独使用时无法收敛，预测误差高；而QuReBot收敛且比经典神经网络基线降低15%的预测误差。

Conclusion: QuReBot框架通过结合量子储层计算和简单神经网络，显著降低了预测误差，为机器人软件回归测试提供了更精确的测试预言，并给出了实际配置建议。

Abstract: Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, interacting with
both the environment and humans to perform their tasks. The software of such
robots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix
bugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of
robot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct
behavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially
unknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this
challenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution.
This paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression
testing of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using
quantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the
construction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid
framework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a
simple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected
behavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case,
yielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15%
reduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network
baseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations
and offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot
software testing.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的轻量级评分方法，利用语言模型改进IDE中的代码补全排名，无需额外模型适配，显著提升了补全的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代IDE中的令牌级代码补全功能对开发者至关重要，但现有系统主要依赖手工启发式或轻量级机器学习模型，这些方法在捕获上下文信息和跨项目泛化方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 该方法将所有有效的补全组织成前缀树，并通过单次贪婪解码传递收集树上的令牌级分数，从而实现了精确的令牌感知排名，无需波束搜索、提示工程或模型适配。

Result: 该方法在不改变现有模型的情况下，实现了快速、架构无关的令牌级补全排名，显著提升了补全建议的准确性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种轻量级且模型无关的新评分方法，用于通过语言模型对静态补全进行排名。这种方法既快速又与现有工具兼容，为将语言模型集成到IDE中提供了一条实用且有效的途径。

Abstract: Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting
relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically
derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are
ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by
users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight
machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to
capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles.
In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions
using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method
organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy
decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a
precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or
model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible
with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a
practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already
existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more
responsive developer assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自然语言指令的代码编辑工具依赖性强且延迟高，难以有效融入开发流程。开发者的历史编辑模式能反映其习惯和目标，为解决这些问题提供了关键数据。

Method: NES采用双模型架构，结合高质量SFT和DAPO数据集进行训练，优化推理过程以减少延迟。

Result: NES在预测下一个编辑位置的两项任务中分别达到75.6%和81.6%的准确率，意图对齐编辑的ES和EMR分别为91.36%和27.7%，优于现有最佳模型。

Conclusion: NES框架通过利用开发者的历史编辑模式，提供了一种无需指令、低延迟的代码编辑解决方案，显著提升了开发效率，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing
code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered
significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that
translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical
limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high
latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow.
We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often
reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to
addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES
(Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an
instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture
and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances
productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to
minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous
Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over
20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6%
and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside
91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models.
Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the
performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at

TL;DR: 开源软件项目的韧性可通过提交频率等指标评估，研究发现大多数项目在不同时间层级上稳定性有限，编程语言和区块链应用表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着组织对开源软件的依赖增加，理解项目演变，特别是项目韧性（恢复正常运营的能力）变得至关重要。

Method: 基于复合稳定性指数（CSI）框架，对100个高排名仓库的提交频率模式进行实证验证。

Result: 研究发现，只有2%的仓库表现出每日稳定性，29%实现每周稳定性，50%展示月度稳定性，而一半的仓库在所有时间层级上都不稳定。编程语言和区块链应用最为稳定。

Conclusion: 开源软件的稳定性可以通过多种指标综合评估，如提交频率、问题解决时间和社区参与度等，以更全面地衡量项目韧性。

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) generates trillions of dollars in economic value
and has become essential to technical infrastructures worldwide. As
organizations increasingly depend on OSS, understanding project evolution is
critical. While existing metrics provide insights into project health, one
dimension remains understudied: project resilience -- the ability to return to
normal operations after disturbances such as contributor departures, security
vulnerabilities, and bug report spikes. We hypothesize that stable commit
patterns reflect underlying project characteristics such as mature governance,
sustained contributors, and robust development processes that enable
resilience. Building on the Composite Stability Index (CSI) framework, we
empirically validate commit frequency patterns across 100 highly ranked
repositories. Our findings reveal that only 2\% of repositories exhibit daily
stability, 29\% achieve weekly stability, and 50\% demonstrate monthly
stability, while half remain unstable across all temporal levels. Programming
languages and blockchain applications were the most stable. We identified two
exemplary repositories that achieved stability at all three granularities,
whose governance models, CI cadence, and release policies could serve as
reference frameworks. We observed that large yearly commit throughput does not
necessarily correlate with stability. Beyond commits, stability can be enriched
with issue-resolution times, PR merge rates, and community-engagement metrics
to broaden resilience assessment and sharpen stability-based risk evaluation.

Motivation: 开源社区文档多语言支持不足，且技术文档翻译（混合自然语言、代码、URL和Markdown格式）的LLM能力尚不明确。

Method: 评估了50个README文件的社区翻译活动，并使用OpenAI的ChatGPT 4和Anthropic的Claude进行英德翻译。

Result: 发现LLM能提供准确翻译，但在保留结构性组件（如超链接）和格式一致性方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为自动化LLM驱动的开源文档创建和维护提供了基础，并提出了TRIFID框架作为翻译质量评估的初步解决方案。

Abstract: While open source communities attract diverse contributors globally, few
repositories provide essential documentation in languages other than English.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
software engineering tasks and translations across domains. However, little is
known about LLM capabilities in translating open-source technical
documentation, which mixes natural language, code, URLs, and markdown
formatting. To understand the need and potential for LLMs in technical
documentation translation, we evaluated community translation activity and
English-to-German translations of 50 README files using OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 and
Anthropic's Claude. We found scarce translation activity, mostly in larger
repositories and community-driven in nature. LLM performance comparison
suggests they can provide accurate translations. However, analysis revealed
fidelity challenges: both models struggled to preserve structural components
(e.g., hyperlinks) and exhibited formatting inconsistencies. These findings
highlight both promise and challenges of LLM-assisted documentation
internationalization. As a first step toward translation-aware continuous
integration pipelines, we introduce TRIFID, an early-stage translation fidelity
scoring framework that automatically checks how well translations preserve
code, links, and formatting. Our efforts provide a foundation for automated
LLM-driven support for creating and maintaining open source documentation.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many
industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks
tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific
code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and
develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria.
This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem
identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific
code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and
consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for
implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML
applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through
an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the
effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current
approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into
development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer
environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件开发的复杂性不仅限于代码实现，还包括维护，因此需要一个高效的系统来定位大型代码库中的bug。

Method: 提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的多代理系统Meta-RAG，利用摘要将代码库压缩79.8%，并生成紧凑的自然语言表示。

Result: Meta-RAG在SWE-bench Lite数据集上的文件级和函数级正确定位率分别为84.67%和53.0%。

Conclusion: Meta-RAG系统在大型代码库中通过信息检索和LLMs实现了高效的bug定位，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such
domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of
a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex
ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the
realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to
localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and
LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an
average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.
We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical
for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of
Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores
84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization
rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种针对花卉采摘机器人的3D感知流程，通过合成数据集和深度学习框架，显著提升了采摘效率和精度，为农业自动化提供了可扩展的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球人口增长，对药用植物（如大马士革玫瑰）的需求激增，但劳动力密集的采摘过程限制了规模化生产。因此，研究旨在开发一种适用于花卉采摘机器人的3D感知流程，以解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 研究采用了两阶段算法：首先在立体图像上进行基于2D点的检测，随后使用轻量级深度神经网络进行深度估计。为了解决真实标注数据稀缺的问题，研究引入了通过Blender生成的光真实感合成数据集，模拟动态玫瑰农场环境并提供精确的3D标注。

Result: 研究结果表明，所提出的方法在2D检测中F1分数达到95.6%（合成数据）和74.4%（真实数据），在2米范围内的深度估计误差为3%（合成数据）。该方法在计算效率上进行了优化，适合资源受限的机器人系统。

Conclusion: 本研究通过提出一种新颖的3D感知流程，为花卉采摘机器人提供了高效的解决方案，特别是在稀疏3D定位方面表现出色。该方法通过合成数据集和深度学习框架的结合，显著提升了模型在真实环境中的性能，为农业自动化提供了可扩展的精准采摘方案。

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for
precision harvesting.

Motivation: 传统方法使用不同的模型处理CAVs的多个任务，导致高部署成本、计算开销大且难以实现实时性能。MTL作为一种有前景的解决方案，能够通过单一模型联合学习多个任务，提高效率和资源利用率。

Method: 本文通过综述的方式，首先概述了CAVs和MTL的基础背景，然后探讨了MTL在感知、预测、规划、控制和多智能体协作等关键功能模块中的应用。

Result: 本文是第一篇专注于CAVs中MTL应用的全面综述，总结了MTL在CAVs关键功能模块中的应用，并提出了未来研究的方向。

Conclusion: 本文总结了多任务学习（MTL）在互联自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）中的应用，并指出了现有方法的优缺点、研究缺口以及未来研究方向。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

Conclusion: BarlowWalk方法通过结合自监督表示学习和PPO算法，显著提升了双足机器人地形的穿越效率，减少了对外部地形感知的依赖，并在复杂地形场景中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), driven by data-driven methods, has become an
effective solution for robot leg motion control problems. However, the
mainstream RL methods for bipedal robot terrain traversal, such as
teacher-student policy knowledge distillation, suffer from long training times,
which limit development efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes
BarlowWalk, an improved Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method integrated
with self-supervised representation learning. This method employs the Barlow
Twins algorithm to construct a decoupled latent space, mapping historical
observation sequences into low-dimensional representations and implementing
self-supervision. Meanwhile, the actor requires only proprioceptive information
to achieve self-supervised learning over continuous time steps, significantly
reducing the dependence on external terrain perception. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in complex terrain
scenarios. To enhance the credibility of the evaluation, this study compares
BarlowWalk with advanced algorithms through comparative tests, and the
experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Method: RIMAOS2C 采用基于服务发现的混合网络通信中间件，结合多级服务发现组播和消息桥机制，优化数据流转发并利用共享内存集中分发消息。

Result: 在 L4 车辆和 Jetson Orin 域控制器测试中，RIMAOS2C 消除了消息冗余，提升大数据传输效率 36% 至 40%，回调延迟波动减少 42% 至 906%。

Conclusion: RIMAOS2C 通过多级服务发现组播和消息桥机制，显著提升了大规模 L4 自动驾驶系统中的通信效率与确定性，为分布式计算架构中的通信优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robotic middleware is fundamental to ensuring reliable communication among
system components and is crucial for intelligent robotics, autonomous vehicles,
and smart manufacturing. However, existing robotic middleware often struggles
to meet the diverse communication demands, optimize data transmission
efficiency, and maintain scheduling determinism between Orin computing units in
large-scale L4 autonomous vehicle deployments. This paper presents RIMAOS2C, a
service discovery-based hybrid network communication middleware designed to
tackle these challenges. By leveraging multi-level service discovery multicast,
RIMAOS2C supports a wide variety of communication modes, including multiple
cross-chip Ethernet protocols and PCIe communication capabilities. Its core
mechanism, the Message Bridge, optimizes data flow forwarding and employs
shared memory for centralized message distribution, reducing message redundancy
and minimizing transmission delay uncertainty. Tested on L4 vehicles and Jetson
Orin domain controllers, RIMAOS2C leverages TCP-based ZeroMQ to overcome the
large-message transmission bottleneck in native CyberRT. In scenarios with two
cross-chip subscribers, it eliminates message redundancy and improves
large-data transmission efficiency by 36 to 40 percent while reducing callback
latency variation by 42 to 906 percent. This research advances the
communication capabilities of robotic operating systems and proposes a novel
approach to optimizing communication in distributed computing architectures for
autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Hestia通过强化学习提出了一种通用的5-DoF最佳视角预测策略，并在真实场景中验证了其可行性，为自动化数据收集提供了新方法。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled
efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains
largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the
challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for
Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages
reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best
viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines
the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice,
observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes,
forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view
approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation
in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene
exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across
three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab
environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合模型优化和学习的方法，通过高效的接触隐式轨迹优化（CITO）和示范引导的深度强化学习（RL），实现了样本高效的学习，并成功实现了从模拟到现实的迁移。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact
interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based
approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects
under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model
inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass,
size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast,
learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but
require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to
propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By
leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization
(CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),
leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer
approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform
pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing
without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several
pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real
transfer.

Motivation: 自主无人机竞速是一个具有挑战性的控制问题，需要实时决策和鲁棒的非线性系统动态处理。传统LMPC在无人机竞速中面临实时兼容性或时间最优与安全穿越之间的权衡问题。

Method: 通过三个关键创新增强LMPC：(1)动态加权时间最优跟踪与中心线跟随的自适应成本函数；(2)防止过度捷径并支持更鲁棒迭代更新的偏移局部安全集；(3)避免Frenet-frame转换奇异性和积分误差的笛卡尔基础公式。

Conclusion: 本文提出的改进LMPC方法在无人机竞速中实现了更快的穿越速度和避碰能力，显著提升了峰值性能。

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing presents a challenging control problem, requiring
real-time decision-making and robust handling of nonlinear system dynamics.
While iterative learning model predictive control~(LMPC) offers a promising
framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to
drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off
between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with
three key innovations:~(1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights
time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence,~(2)~a shifted local safe
set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates,
and~(3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints
without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame
transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories
generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a
maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85\%. Even applied to the most
aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real
drone, a 6.05\% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method
pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation
and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak
performance of drone racing.

Conclusion: 人类-机器人红队方法展示了在安全关键问题领域中安全操作和促进信任的可行性。

Abstract: While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit
in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in
high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in
order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically
those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot
red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to
work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the
space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform
safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment,
risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red
teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety
of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate
safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with
varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red
teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this
approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in
safety-critical problem domains.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一特征距离启发式检索数据，可能引入无关演示或忽略关键信息，限制了少样本模仿学习的性能。

Conclusion: COLLAGE通过自适应后期融合机制，有效整合多种特征线索，显著提升了少样本模仿学习中的数据检索和策略训练性能，在仿真和现实任务中均优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation
learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for
a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve
data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best
demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in
visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a
subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental
demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene
layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We
present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation
learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of
relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.
COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to
subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,
appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained
on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are
then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data
more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general
and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by
any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest
benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms
state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in
simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,
where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset. More information

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合学习和优化的统一生成-细化框架，通过奖励引导的条件流匹配（CFM）模型和模型预测路径积分（MPPI）控制，实现了在动态环境中灵活适应并满足实时安全要求的机器人行为规划。

Abstract: Planning safe and effective robot behavior in dynamic, human-centric
environments remains a core challenge due to the need to handle uncertainty,
adapt in real-time, and ensure safety. Optimization-based planners offer
explicit constraint handling but rely on oversimplified initialization,
reducing solution quality. Learning-based planners better capture multimodal
possible solutions but struggle to enforce constraints such as safety. In this
paper, we introduce a unified generation-refinement framework bridging learning
and optimization with a novel reward-guided conditional flow matching (CFM)
model and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control. Our key innovation is
in the incorporation of a bidirectional information exchange: samples from a
reward-guided CFM model provide informed priors for MPPI refinement, while the
optimal trajectory from MPPI warm-starts the next CFM generation. Using
autonomous social navigation as a motivating application, we demonstrate that
our approach can flexibly adapt to dynamic environments to satisfy safety
requirements in real-time.

Abstract: The human nervous system exhibits bilateral symmetry, enabling coordinated
and balanced movements. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot,
leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor
control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL
framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry
invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces
consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and
spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive
experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and
real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that
SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability
to humanoid robots.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将触觉视为次要的、反应性的通道，而VLH旨在通过上下文视觉理解和自然语言指令直接合成空中力和振动提示，统一感知、语言和触觉反馈。

Method: VLH平台包括配备双逆向五杆联动阵列的8英寸四旋翼无人机、自我中心VR摄像头和外中心俯视图。视觉输入和语言指令通过微调的OpenVLA骨干网络处理，输出7维动作向量。采用INT8量化和高性能服务器确保实时操作。

Result: 在90次飞行的人机交互实验中，VLH实现了56.7%的目标获取成功率（平均到达时间21.3秒，姿态误差0.24米）和100%的纹理识别准确率。在新任务上的泛化测试表现分别为视觉70.0%、运动54.4%、物理40.0%和语义35.0%。

Conclusion: VLH展示了将触觉反馈与感知推理和意图共同演进的能力，推动了表达性和沉浸式的人机交互。

Abstract: We present VLH, a novel Visual-Language-Haptic Foundation Model that unifies
perception, language, and tactile feedback in aerial robotics and virtual
reality. Unlike prior work that treats haptics as a secondary, reactive
channel, VLH synthesizes mid-air force and vibration cues as a direct
consequence of contextual visual understanding and natural language commands.
Our platform comprises an 8-inch quadcopter equipped with dual inverse five-bar
linkage arrays for localized haptic actuation, an egocentric VR camera, and an
exocentric top-down view. Visual inputs and language instructions are processed
by a fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone - adapted via LoRA on a bespoke dataset of 450
multimodal scenarios - to output a 7-dimensional action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx,
Hy, Hz, Hv). INT8 quantization and a high-performance server ensure real-time
operation at 4-5 Hz. In human-robot interaction experiments (90 flights), VLH
achieved a 56.7% success rate for target acquisition (mean reach time 21.3 s,
pose error 0.24 m) and 100% accuracy in texture discrimination. Generalization
tests yielded 70.0% (visual), 54.4% (motion), 40.0% (physical), and 35.0%
(semantic) performance on novel tasks. These results demonstrate VLH's ability
to co-evolve haptic feedback with perceptual reasoning and intent, advancing
expressive, immersive human-robot interactions.

TL;DR: MoRe-ERL结合ERL和残差学习优化轨迹，实验证明其高效且易于迁移到实际系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决预规划轨迹在实际任务中可能不够安全、可行或高效的问题，提出了一个通用框架，既能保留关键任务动作，又能动态调整轨迹。

Method: MoRe-ERL结合了Episodic Reinforcement Learning (ERL)和残差学习，利用B-Spline-based运动基元生成平滑的残差调整，优化预规划的参考轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，残差学习显著优于从头开始的ERL训练，样本效率和任务性能更优，且仿真训练的策略可直接部署到现实系统，模拟到现实的差距极小。

Conclusion: MoRe-ERL框架通过结合ERL和残差学习，显著提升了轨迹优化的样本效率和任务性能，且能无缝迁移到实际硬件系统中，验证了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement
Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference
trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories.
This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and
motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring
modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it
generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives
to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory
refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning
significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving
superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further
validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be
directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.

Motivation: 解决现实环境中终身学习的关键挑战，包括持续学习、多模块记忆延迟、任务相关性捕捉和闭环规划中的无限循环缓解。

Method: RoboMemory框架包含四个核心模块：信息预处理器（类丘脑）、终身体现记忆系统（类海马体）、闭环规划模块（类前额叶）和低级执行器（类小脑），通过并行化更新/检索和动态知识图谱提升记忆一致性和可扩展性。

Result: 在EmbodiedBench上，RoboMemory的平均成功率比开源基线（Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins）高25%，比闭源最先进技术（Claude3.5-Sonnet）高5%，确立了新的SOTA。

Conclusion: RoboMemory通过整合多记忆模块和动态知识图谱，显著提升了物理机器人的终身学习能力，并在基准测试中超越了现有技术。

Abstract: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong
learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in
real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task
correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning.
Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the
Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System
(hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and
the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and
cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the
framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via
parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic
submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent
architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations
on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline
(Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the
closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing
new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory,
long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning
capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks.
RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a
foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical
robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据增强技术有所进步，但通过模仿学习训练的策略仍难以在光照变化等环境变化中泛化。

Method: 通过逆向渲染分解每个演示的第一帧为几何和材质属性，并利用这些属性在不同光照下渲染外观变化。为了确保每个演示中的一致增强，使用机器人执行视频对Stable Video Diffusion进行微调以实现时间光照传播。

Result: 在6种光照条件下，通过720次真实世界评估，该框架显著减少了行为克隆的泛化差距（40.1%）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个利用物理基础逆向渲染进行光照增强的框架，显著减少了行为克隆的泛化差距（40.1%），并在7自由度机器人上通过720次真实世界评估验证了其有效性。此外，还展示了该框架支持的三个下游应用。

Abstract: Despite advances in data augmentation, policies trained via imitation
learning still struggle to generalize across environmental variations such as
lighting changes. To address this, we propose the first framework that
leverages physically-based inverse rendering for lighting augmentation on
real-world human demonstrations. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the
first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and
material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to
render appearance changes under different lighting. To ensure consistent
augmentation across each demonstration, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on
robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our
framework by measuring the structural and temporal consistency of the augmented
sequences, and by assessing its effectiveness in reducing the behavior cloning
generalization gap (40.1%) on a 7-DoF robot across 6 lighting conditions using
720 real-world evaluations. We further showcase three downstream applications
enabled by the proposed framework.

Motivation: 解决现有集中式控制方案在可扩展性、灵活性和计算成本上的局限性，实现高效、去中心化的负载操控。

Method: 利用多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练每个微型飞行器（MAV）的外环控制策略，无需全局状态、MAV间通信或邻居信息，仅通过负载位姿观测实现隐式通信。

Result: 在真实实验中验证了方法的有效性，包括在负载模型不确定下的全姿态控制，性能与集中式方法相当，并展示了异构策略协作和单MAV失效的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过去中心化的多智能体强化学习（MARL）实现了6自由度负载的实时操控，验证了在真实场景中的高性能、可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF
manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles
(MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train
an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers
that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,
inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents
communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high
scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs
during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,
we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration
and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,
enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused
by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various
real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model
uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst
agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete
in-flight loss of one MAV. Videos of experiments:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将人类直觉量化为视觉导航的奖励函数，从而提升机器人导航的泛化能力和效率。

Method: HALO通过离线数据学习奖励模型，利用专家轨迹和基于Boltzmann分布的动作偏好排序，结合Plackett-Luce损失函数训练奖励模型。

Result: HALO在真实世界部署中，成功率和轨迹效率显著优于现有方法，具体表现为成功率提升33.3%，轨迹长度减少12.9%，Frechet距离减少26.6%。

Conclusion: HALO在多样化的实际场景中部署后，展现出比现有最先进的基于视觉的导航方法更优的性能，成功率和轨迹效率均有显著提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce HALO, a novel Offline Reward Learning algorithm
that quantifies human intuition in navigation into a vision-based reward
function for robot navigation. HALO learns a reward model from offline data,
leveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training,
actions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using
preference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the
preferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive
navigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to
align with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO,
we deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline
learned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a
model-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward
as an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both
learning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments
on a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained
with HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not
present in the training data. HALO outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based
navigation methods, achieving at least a 33.3% improvement in success rate, a
12.9% reduction in normalized trajectory length, and a 26.6% reduction in
Frechet distance compared to human expert trajectories.

Motivation: 自动驾驶感知任务在雾、雨等恶劣天气下表现不佳，现有域适应方法依赖清晰参考图像且难以应对混合天气条件，亟需一种无需参考且通用的解决方案。

Method: Advent框架包含三个组件：(I) 局部序列机制（LSM）利用相邻帧的时间相关性实现天气无关效果；(II) 全局混洗机制（GSM）防止对LSM诱导的时间模式过拟合；(III) 展开正则化器（URs）通过惩罚模型复杂度增强跨天气泛化能力。

Conclusion: Advent框架通过其三个核心组件（LSM、GSM和URs）有效解决了域适应中的两个主要挑战，无需清晰参考图像且能适应任意天气条件，显著提升了自动驾驶感知任务的性能。

Abstract: Various adverse weather conditions such as fog and rain pose a significant
challenge to autonomous driving (AD) perception tasks like semantic
segmentation, object detection, etc. The common domain adaption strategy is to
minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather
conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically
relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain
in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and
performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather
conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse
weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model
architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is
achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of
clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition.
Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential
Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to
achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind
arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed
to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence
to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded
Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed
regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather
generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess
the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large
margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行为克隆（BC）在异构数据集（如不同相机视角或物体外观）中因过拟合单个演示而泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出CLASS方法，利用动态时间规整（DTW）识别相似动作序列，通过加权正样本对的软InfoNCE损失优化监督对比学习。

Result: 在5个模拟基准和3个实际任务中，CLASS仅用表征检索控制即达到竞争性结果；在视觉差异下，Diffusion Policy与CLASS预训练的平均成功率高达75%，远超其他基线方法。

Conclusion: CLASS通过监督对比学习和动作序列相似性加权，显著提升了在视觉差异下的行为克隆泛化能力，并在模拟和实际任务中取得了竞争性结果。

Abstract: Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have led to strong performance in
robotic manipulation, driven by expressive models, sequence modeling of
actions, and large-scale demonstration data. However, BC faces significant
challenges when applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with
different camera poses or object appearances, where performance degrades
despite the benefits of learning at scale. This stems from BC's tendency to
overfit individual demonstrations rather than capture shared structure,
limiting generalization. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via
Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral
representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning.
CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with
similarity-weighted positive pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation
benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve competitive results using
retrieval-based control with representations only. Most notably, for downstream
policy learning under significant visual shifts, Diffusion Policy with CLASS
pre-training achieves an average success rate of 75%, while all other baseline
methods fail to perform competitively. Project webpage:

Motivation: 传统的流匹配方法在多模态处理上表现不佳，容易产生平均或模糊行为，因此需要一种新方法来有效捕捉任务级和轨迹级的多模态。

Method: VFP引入了变分潜在先验进行模态感知的动作生成，结合Kantorovich最优传输进行分布级对齐，并采用混合专家解码器进行模态专业化与高效推理。

Result: VFP在41个任务上的评估显示，相比标准流基线，任务成功率相对提升了49%。

Conclusion: VFP在任务和路径多模态设置中表现出色，显著提升了任务成功率，同时保持了快速推理和紧凑的模型规模。

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach
for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in
action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional
flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to
averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this,
we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a
variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively
captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further
incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level
alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode
specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41
tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and
sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show
that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over
standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact
model size. More details are available on our project page:

Result: 在150种多样物体上，DexReMoE的平均连续成功次数为19.5，并将最差情况性能从0.69提高到6.05。

Conclusion: DexReMoE框架展示了在通用手内物体重新定向任务中的可扩展性和适应性，显著提高了多样物体处理的平均和最差情况性能。

Abstract: In hand object reorientation provides capability for dexterous manipulation,
requiring robust control policies to manage diverse object geometries, maintain
stable grasps, and execute precise complex orientation trajectories. However,
prior works focus on single objects or simple geometries and struggle to
generalize to complex shapes. In this work, we introduce DexReMoE (Dexterous
Reorientation Mixture-of-Experts), in which multiple expert policies are
trained for different complex shapes and integrated within a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) framework, making the approach capable of generalizing across a wide
range of objects. Additionally, we incorporate object category information as
privileged inputs to enhance shape representation. Our framework is trained in
simulation using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluated on novel
out-of-distribution objects in the most challenging scenario of reorienting
objects held in the air by a downward-facing hand. In terms of the average
consecutive success count, DexReMoE achieves a score of 19.5 across a diverse
set of 150 objects. In comparison to the baselines, it also enhances the
worst-case performance, increasing it from 0.69 to 6.05. These results
underscore the scalability and adaptability of the DexReMoE framework for
general-purpose in-hand reorientation.

Abstract: Terrain traversability estimation is crucial for autonomous robots,
especially in unstructured environments where visual cues and reasoning play a
key role. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer potential for zero-shot
estimation, the problem remains inherently ill-posed. To explore this, we
introduce a small dataset of human-annotated water traversability ratings,
revealing that while estimations are subjective, human raters still show some
consensus. Additionally, we propose a simple pipeline that integrates VLMs for
zero-shot traversability estimation. Our experiments reveal mixed results,
suggesting that current foundation models are not yet suitable for practical
deployment but provide valuable insights for further research.

Abstract: Grounding natural language instructions to visual observations is fundamental
for embodied agents operating in open-world environments. Recent advances in
visual-language mapping have enabled generalizable semantic representations by
leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). However, these methods often fall
short in aligning free-form language commands with specific scene instances,
due to limitations in both instance-level semantic consistency and instruction
interpretation. We present OpenMap, a zero-shot open-vocabulary visual-language
map designed for accurate instruction grounding in navigation tasks. To address
semantic inconsistencies across views, we introduce a Structural-Semantic
Consensus constraint that jointly considers global geometric structure and
vision-language similarity to guide robust 3D instance-level aggregation. To
improve instruction interpretation, we propose an LLM-assisted
Instruction-to-Instance Grounding module that enables fine-grained instance
selection by incorporating spatial context and expressive target descriptions.
We evaluate OpenMap on ScanNet200 and Matterport3D, covering both semantic
mapping and instruction-to-target retrieval tasks. Experimental results show
that OpenMap outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in bridging free-form language
and 3D perception for embodied navigation.

To move beyond these limitations, we propose roleplaying metaphors as a

Director, Puppeteer, and Wizard, we demonstrate how narrative framing can guide
the creation of diverse gesture sets and interaction styles. These roles enable
a variety of scenarios, showing how roleplay can unlock new possibilities for

Motivation: 当前的手动方法存在交叉感染和粘膜损伤风险高的问题，且NTI自动化尚未探索。

Method: 提出了一种新型自主NTI系统，包括嵌入力传感器的假体用于安全评估和数据过滤，以及RACCT模型用于处理复杂的管-组织相互作用和部分视觉观察。

Result: RACCT模型在所有方面优于ACT模型，平均峰值插入力比手动操作减少66%，同时保持相同成功率。

Conclusion: 该系统验证了在降低感染风险和提高手术安全性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is critical for establishing artificial airways
in clinical anesthesia and critical care. Current manual methods face
significant challenges, including cross-infection, especially during
respiratory infection care, and insufficient control of endoluminal contact
forces, increasing the risk of mucosal injuries. While existing studies have
focused on automated endoscopic insertion, the automation of NTI remains
unexplored despite its unique challenges: Nasotracheal tubes exhibit greater
diameter and rigidity than standard endoscopes, substantially increasing
insertion complexity and patient risks. We propose a novel autonomous NTI
system with two key components to address these challenges. First, an
autonomous NTI system is developed, incorporating a prosthesis embedded with
force sensors, allowing for safety assessment and data filtering. Then, the
Recurrent Action-Confidence Chunking with Transformer (RACCT) model is
developed to handle complex tube-tissue interactions and partial visual
observations. Experimental results demonstrate that the RACCT model outperforms
the ACT model in all aspects and achieves a 66% reduction in average peak
insertion force compared to manual operations while maintaining equivalent
success rates. This validates the system's potential for reducing infection
risks and improving procedural safety.

Abstract: Magnetic soft continuum robots are capable of bending with remote control in
confined space environments, and they have been applied in various
bioengineering contexts. As one type of ferromagnetic soft continuums, the
Magnetically Induced Metamorphic Materials (MIMMs)-based continuum (MC)
exhibits similar bending behaviors. Based on the characteristics of its base
material, MC is flexible in modifying unit stiffness and convenient in molding
fabrication. However, recent studies on magnetic continuum robots have
primarily focused on one or two design parameters, limiting the development of
a comprehensive magnetic continuum bending model. In this work, we constructed
graded-stiffness MCs (GMCs) and developed a numerical model for GMCs' bending
performance, incorporating four key parameters that determine their
performance. The simulated bending results were validated with real bending
experiments in four different categories: varying magnetic field,
cross-section, unit stiffness, and unit length. The graded-stiffness design
strategy applied to GMCs prevents sharp bending at the fixed end and results in
a more circular curvature. We also trained an expansion model for GMCs' bending
performance that is highly efficient and accurate compared to the simulation
process. An extensive library of bending prediction for GMCs was built using
the trained model.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has revolutionized the healthcare industry by
providing surgeons with greater precision, reducing invasiveness, and improving
patient outcomes. However, the success of these surgeries depends heavily on
the robotic system ability to accurately interpret the intentions of the
surgical trainee or even surgeons. One critical factor impacting intent
recognition is the cognitive workload experienced during the procedure. In our
recent research project, we are building an intelligent adaptive system to
monitor cognitive workload and improve learning outcomes in robot-assisted
surgery. The project will focus on achieving a semantic understanding of
surgeon intents and monitoring their mental state through an intelligent
multi-modal assistive framework. This system will utilize brain activity, heart
rate, muscle activity, and eye tracking to enhance intent recognition, even in
mentally demanding situations. By improving the robotic system ability to
interpret the surgeons intentions, we can further enhance the benefits of
robot-assisted surgery and improve surgery outcomes.

Abstract: Modular robotics research has long been preoccupied with perfecting the
modules themselves -- their actuation methods, connectors, controls,
communication, and fabrication. This inward focus results, in part, from the
complexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile
laboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the
Variable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and
reveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In
this work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better
robot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular
robots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion,
adaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from
simple two-dimensional robot assemblies. By using environment features --
ledges, gaps, and slopes -- we show how the environment can extend the robots'
capabilities. Nature has long mastered this principle: organisms not only
adapt, but exploit their environments to their advantage. Robots must learn to
do the same. This study is a step towards modular robotic systems that
transcend their limitations by exploiting environmental features.

Conclusion: L3M+P通过结合外部知识图谱和多模态输入更新机制，显著提升了服务机器人在长期连续部署中的规划能力，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs),
recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks
given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose
service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally
require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is
not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on
isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term
continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the
environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as
planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper
introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge
graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from
multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language
interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the
absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At
planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves
context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for
classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world
service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods
both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly
generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

Abstract: World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic
simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators
with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness
of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if
the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a
pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric
employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model
predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially
controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are
interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the
standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego
vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where
top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego
agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we
propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to
uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as
pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world
models under these new metrics.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor design capable of folding its arms
vertically to grasp objects and navigate through narrow spaces. The
transformation is controlled actively by a central servomotor, gears, and
racks. The arms connect the motor bases to the central frame, forming a
parallelogram structure that ensures the propellers maintain a constant
orientation during morphing. In its stretched state, the quadrotor resembles a
conventional design, and when contracted, it functions as a gripper with
grasping components emerging from the motor bases. To mitigate disturbances
during transforming and grasping payloads, we employ an adaptive sliding mode
controller with a disturbance observer. After fully folded, the quadrotor frame
shrinks to 67% of its original size. The control performance and versatility of
the morphing quadrotor are validated through real-world experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation

isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we
observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP),
suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present
NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI

NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that
generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii)
employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better
generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient
learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain
benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI

Abstract: Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated
increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving
non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments.
However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means
to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability
to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly
useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.
Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not
naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the
right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible
to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining
for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a
small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the
most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit
ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to
inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large
in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20
demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates
on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts
performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST
alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning
interface for new manipulation tasks. Website: https://ricl-vla.github.io.

Method: SetItUp采用两阶段方法：首先通过大型语言模型（LLMs）从任务规范和少量训练样本中生成Python程序以预测对象间的抽象空间关系（grounding graph），其次通过预训练的扩散模型组合预测对象姿势。

Result: SetItUp在餐桌餐具、书架物品和卧室家具布局三个任务家族的数据集上表现优异，生成的排列功能性强、物理可行且美观。

Conclusion: SetItUp通过神经符号框架成功解决了功能对象排列（FORM）中的目标姿势不明确问题，其性能优于现有模型，能够生成功能性强、物理可行且美观的对象排列。

Abstract: Functional object arrangement (FORM) is the task of arranging objects to
fulfill a function, e.g., "set up a dining table for two". One key challenge
here is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not
explicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,
a neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects
from a few training examples and a structured natural-language task
specification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract
spatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate
representation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)
predicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the
grounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to
induce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.
This program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.
For (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture
primitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object
poses based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning
three distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing
items on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom. Experiments show
that SetItUp outperforms existing models in generating functional, physically
feasible, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements. This article extends
our conference paper published at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2024.

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry
and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling
robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However,
existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of
articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve
complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting
their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce
ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB
observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which
are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic
structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously
reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.
We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy
across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,
text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应自监督学习框架通过实时整合新数据，显著提高了机器人插入任务的长期可靠性和精度，同时减少了对人工干预的需求。

Abstract: The automation of robotic tasks requires high precision and adaptability,
particularly in force-based operations such as insertions. Traditional
learning-based approaches either rely on static datasets, which limit their
ability to generalize, or require frequent manual intervention to maintain good
performances. As a result, ensuring long-term reliability without human
supervision remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an
adaptive self-supervised learning framework for insertion classification that
continuously improves its precision over time. The framework operates in
real-time, incrementally refining its classification decisions by integrating
newly acquired force data. Unlike conventional methods, it does not rely on
pre-collected datasets but instead evolves dynamically with each task
execution. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate how the system
progressively reduces execution time while maintaining near-perfect precision
as more samples are processed. This adaptability ensures long-term reliability
in force-based robotic tasks while minimizing the need for manual intervention.

TL;DR: A moment matching-based point cloud registration method is proposed, outperforming traditional techniques in sparse, noisy conditions and enhancing SLAM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional registration methods like ICP and NDT struggle with sparse points and heavy noise, prompting the need for a more robust and accurate alignment technique.

Method: The paper introduces a registration framework based on moment matching, treating point clouds as i.i.d. samples from the same distribution. It matches generalized Gaussian Radial Basis moments to estimate rigid transformations without requiring explicit point-to-point correspondences.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and robustness than existing methods, significantly improving localization performance in a 4D Radar SLAM system.

Conclusion: The proposed moment matching technique demonstrates significant potential for robust point cloud registration in sparse and noisy scenarios, achieving comparable results to LiDAR-based systems when integrated into a 4D Radar SLAM system.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in
conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration
methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions
Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate
alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration
framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are
regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the
source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis
moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation
between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit
point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the
consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than
existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM
system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance
and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings
demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud
registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: FedVLA框架通过联邦学习有效解决了VLA模型训练中的隐私问题，同时保持了与集中式训练相当的任务成功率，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by enabling robots to interpret language instructions for task
execution. However, training these models often relies on large-scale
user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn
limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first
federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that
preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework
integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and
expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving
training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented
Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features
based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively
learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE)
mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively
decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation
strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by
activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive
simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency
compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates

Abstract: Bipedal locomotion is a key challenge in robotics, particularly for robots
like Bolt, which have a point-foot design. This study explores the control of
such underactuated robots using constrained reinforcement learning, addressing
their inherent instability, lack of arms, and limited foot actuation. We
present a methodology that leverages Constraints-as-Terminations and domain
randomization techniques to enable sim-to-real transfer. Through a series of
qualitative and quantitative experiments, we evaluate our approach in terms of
balance maintenance, velocity control, and responses to slip and push
disturbances. Additionally, we analyze autonomy through metrics like the cost
of transport and ground reaction force. Our method advances robust control
strategies for point-foot bipedal robots, offering insights into broader
locomotion.

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了在关节物体操作中长期存在的有效性与效率之间的权衡问题，无需依赖先前的运动学知识。

Abstract: Adept manipulation of articulated objects is essential for robots to operate
successfully in human environments. Such manipulation requires both
effectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and
efficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions.
Existing approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods
relying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering
structural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust
manipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through
reactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces
TacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated
object manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous
approaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals
requiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources
of local kinematic information. This new perspective enables our controller to
predict optimal future interactions and make proactive adjustments,
significantly enhancing manipulation efficiency. In comprehensive evaluations
across 200 diverse simulated articulated objects and real-world experiments,
our approach maintains a 100% success rate while significantly outperforming
the previous tactile-informed method in time efficiency, action efficiency, and
trajectory smoothness (all p-values < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that
the long-standing trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in articulated
object manipulation can be successfully resolved without relying on prior
kinematic knowledge.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for
developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress
inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges
related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training
stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA
models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In
this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework
specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal
difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent
characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT,
an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of
demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation
learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone
and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to
optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world
environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods,
achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle
time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization
capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive lattice-based motion planning solution to
address the problem of generating feasible trajectories for systems,
represented by a linearly parameterizable non-linear model operating within a
cluttered environment. The system model is considered to have uncertain model
parameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update
the model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic
estimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error
reduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives
generated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model
selected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also
equipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal
estimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall
motion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the
size of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive
learning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well
as in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter
and the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of
the implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go
arbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with
the true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion
planning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is
demonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model
represented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and
operating within a cluttered environment.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual
input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of
natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a
wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount
of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,
we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few
demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides
object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the
object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an
instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image
crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target
objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on
both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned
with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates
zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

novel framework for enhancing the attention of the iCub humanoid robot by
integrating advanced perceptual abilities to recognise social cues, understand

the human and the robot create a short imaginary story together, exchanging in
turn cubes with creative images placed on them. To validate the protocol and
the framework, experiments were performed to quantify the degree of usability

Conclusion: QuaDreamer通过生成高质量的全景视频数据，显著提升了四足机器人在全景视觉感知任务中的性能，特别是在多目标跟踪方面。

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are
suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training
data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration
challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems
tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose
QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for
quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of
quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,
providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively
capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during
quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts
controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and
provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video
generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller
(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter
control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in
wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream
architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail
enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.
We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training
data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the
performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and
model weights will be publicly available at

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world
deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and
permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly
degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite
its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in
the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the
complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware
coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot
target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our
approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)
probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent
sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding
inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or
communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized
behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned
into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and
collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots
experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate
independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them
to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate
our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive
assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our
framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments
with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for
the multi-robot systems community.

Abstract: In order to expand the operational range and payload capacity of robots,
wire-driven robots that leverage the external environment have been proposed.
It can exert forces and operate in spaces far beyond those dictated by its own
structural limits. However, for practical use, robots must autonomously attach
multiple wires to the environment based on environmental recognition-an
operation so difficult that many wire-driven robots remain restricted to
specialized, pre-designed environments. Here, in this study, we propose a robot
that autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a
multi-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and
environmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an
anchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by
flying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable
attachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in
environments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple
wires simultaneously. Through this approach, a wire-driven robot can
autonomously attach its wires to the environment, thereby realizing the
benefits of wire-driven operation at any location.

Abstract: Robotic cutting is a challenging contact-rich manipulation task where the
robot must simultaneously negotiate unknown object mechanics, large contact
forces, and precise motion requirements. We introduce a new virtual-model
control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators,
without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment.
Motion is generated through interconnection with virtual mechanisms, given by
virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through
analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior
settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator
demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter
slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same
controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and
adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and
platform independence.

Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in orchards presents
significant challenges due to obstacles and GPS-deprived environments. In this
work, we introduce a learning-based approach to achieve vision-based navigation
of UAVs within orchard rows. Our method employs a variational autoencoder
(VAE)-based controller, trained with an intervention-based learning framework
that allows the UAV to learn a visuomotor policy from human experience. We
validate our approach in real orchard environments with a custom-built
quadrotor platform. Field experiments demonstrate that after only a few
iterations of training, the proposed VAE-based controller can autonomously
navigate the UAV based on a front-mounted camera stream. The controller
exhibits strong obstacle avoidance performance, achieves longer flying
distances with less human assistance, and outperforms existing algorithms.
Furthermore, we show that the policy generalizes effectively to novel
environments and maintains competitive performance across varying conditions
and speeds. This research not only advances UAV autonomy but also holds
significant potential for precision agriculture, improving efficiency in
orchard monitoring and management.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.
However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor
policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we
introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that
systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual
monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for
embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system
first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program
grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed
in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected
checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure
reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events
with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and
repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting
program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that
HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of
robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating
multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Motivation: 现有辅助机器人解决方案假设人类保持静态或准静态，限制了其有效性。为提升辅助护理能力，特别是在机器人辅助床浴和穿衣等任务中，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用物理模拟器，结合反极采样和力闭合抓取技术，以及基于MPPI和矢量场的控制方法，生成满足生物力学和碰撞避免约束的运动轨迹。

Result: 在多种肢体操作任务中验证了方法的有效性，包括不同体位和年龄组的肩关节限制，并在真实人体模型和床浴任务中展示了其实际应用效果。

Conclusion: Manip4Care通过结合生物力学和碰撞避免约束，提供了一种有效的机器人抓取和重定位人类肢体的方法，并在实际应用中展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp and reposition human limbs can significantly enhance
their ability to provide assistive care to individuals with severe mobility
impairments, particularly in tasks such as robot-assisted bed bathing and
dressing. However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the
human remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address
this issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables
robotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our
approach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for
grasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision
avoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with
force closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model
Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to
generate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical
constraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks
in both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age
groups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our
approach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further
showcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks.

TL;DR: 提出半监督两阶段框架，通过残差引导DDPM和轻量级U-Net，在BraTS 2021上实现高精度脑肿瘤分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描中脑肿瘤的精确分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种半监督的两阶段框架。第一阶段使用残差引导的DDPM进行跨模态合成，第二阶段通过轻量级U-Net结合残差图和多模态输入来优化分割。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，全肿瘤分割的Dice分数为93.02%，IoU为86.7%，优于BraTS 2020上的ReCoSeg基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在BraTS 2021数据集上实现了全肿瘤分割的Dice分数93.02%和IoU 86.7%，优于ReCoSeg基线，展示了在真实世界、多中心MRI数据集上的更高准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT 作为一种针对医学图像分割优化的移动模型，在计算效率与性能之间取得了平衡，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，展示了其在移动医疗图像分析中的高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive

methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments

Motivation: 长期以来，‘状态’这一概念缺乏共识或形式化的清晰定义，本文旨在通过数学上严谨的统一形式结构，为包括智能的公理化定义在内的多样化系统强化理论基础。

Method: 研究首先提出了一个由状态深度和映射层次组成的‘分层状态网格’，作为统一的符号系统；随后引入了‘中间元宇宙（IMU）’以明确描述定义者和语言，避免自引用和逻辑不一致。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于‘定义=状态’原则的元形式逻辑框架，为智能定义、形式逻辑和科学理论提供了数学上严谨的基础。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

TL;DR: AgentTTS是一个基于LLM代理的框架，通过迭代反馈自主优化多阶段任务中的计算资源分配，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多阶段复杂任务中的测试时间计算最优缩放问题，以解决现有研究主要关注单阶段任务而忽略多阶段任务中模型和预算分配的相互依赖性和高成本搜索的挑战。

Method: 通过广泛的试点实验，提取了三个关于LLM在多阶段任务中行为的经验性洞察，并基于这些洞察提出了AgentTTS框架，利用LLM代理通过迭代反馈自主搜索最优计算资源分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，AgentTTS在搜索效率、对训练集大小变化的鲁棒性以及解释性方面均优于传统方法和其他LLM基线。

Conclusion: AgentTTS框架在多阶段复杂任务中显著提高了计算资源分配的效率和效果，优于传统方法和其他基于LLM的基线。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

*Abeer Dyoub,Ivan Letteri,Francesca A. Lisi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ff4ERA是一个基于模糊逻辑的伦理风险评估框架，通过量化风险评分支持AI系统做出符合人类价值观的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着共生AI（SAI）的发展，伦理风险评估（ERA）面临不确定性、模糊性和信息不完整等挑战，需要一种灵活、透明且 robust 的框架来支持伦理决策。

Method: 引入ff4ERA框架，整合模糊逻辑（Fuzzy Logic）、模糊层次分析法（FAHP）和确定性因素（CF），通过伦理风险评分（ERS）量化多种伦理风险。

Result: 案例研究表明，ff4ERA生成的伦理风险评分具有上下文敏感性，能够反映专家输入和传感器证据，且在无关输入下保持稳健。

Conclusion: ff4ERA框架通过结合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法和确定性因素，能够生成可解释、可追踪且风险感知的伦理评估，支持假设分析和指导设计者进行可靠的伦理决策支持。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否在风险决策中表现出与人类相似的启发式和偏见，以及情境如何影响其风险偏好。

Method: 通过实验测试大型语言模型在多种场景下的风险决策行为，并与前景理论进行比较分析。

Result: 发现大型语言模型的风险决策行为与前景理论一致，且军事场景的框架效应显著强于民用场景。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型在风险决策中表现出与人类相似的启发式和偏见，尤其是前景理论所描述的模式。同时，情境（如军事与民用场景）对风险偏好的影响显著，揭示了语言模型如何捕捉和反映人类决策中的局部偏见。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

Conclusion: CHECK框架通过语义分析和逻辑优化显著提升了多跳问答任务的准确性，相比现有方法平均提高了22.8%。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

TL;DR: REACT is a real-time V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework using a lightweight VLM, reducing collisions by 77% and achieving fast inference for safer autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based V2X frameworks have limitations in generalization, contextual reasoning, and mono-modal inputs, while Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced reasoning but lack real-time performance. REACT addresses these gaps by providing a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework.

Method: REACT integrates a fine-tuned lightweight VLM with specialized modules for processing multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories, and incorporates edge adaptation strategies to ensure real-time performance.

Result: REACT achieves a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality (VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the DeepAccident benchmark.

Conclusion: REACT demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for real-time edge-based cooperative planning, showcasing the potential of language-guided contextual reasoning to enhance safety and responsiveness in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Result: 实验表明，gpuRDF2vec在单节点和多节点设置下均显著快于现有最快方案（如jRDF2vec），尤其在大型/密集图上表现优异。

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Motivation: 生成式AI（如ChatGPT）的输出可能突然从正确变为误导或错误，且用户难以察觉，已造成重大损失和伤亡，亟需解决。

Method: 通过将AI输出映射到多自旋热系统，揭示了基本注意力头层面的临界不稳定性，并推导了临界点的精确公式。

Result: 研究发现了AI输出中的临界不稳定性，并展示了其如何通过多层架构放大，同时提供了量化用户风险和法律责任的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了生成式AI输出中隐藏的临界不稳定性，并提供了量化用户风险和法律责任的新路径。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

TL;DR: 研究通过卫星图像和AI文本数据融合，提升了家庭财富预测的准确性，发现LLM知识比代理检索文本更有效，并验证了多模态数据的部分表征趋同性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索社会经济指标（如家庭财富）是否能在卫星图像和互联网文本中留下可恢复的痕迹，并验证多模态数据融合在预测中的优势。

Method: 研究结合了卫星图像（Landsat）和LLM生成的文本描述，开发了五种预测管道：视觉模型、LLM仅使用位置/年份、AI代理搜索/合成网络文本、联合图像-文本编码器以及所有信号的集成模型。

Result: 融合视觉和文本数据的框架在财富预测上表现优于仅使用视觉的基线（R平方0.77 vs. 0.63），LLM内部知识比代理检索的文本更有效，且在多国和跨时间泛化中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个多模态框架，通过融合卫星图像和AI生成的文本数据，显著提升了家庭财富预测的准确性，并验证了视觉与语言模态在表征物质福祉方面的部分趋同性。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

Result: 在INTERACTION数据集上的实验表明，H2C平均减少了22.71%的灾难性遗忘，且无需手动分布变化信息。

Conclusion: H2C方法通过选择性回忆学习样本有效减少了灾难性遗忘问题，提高了轨迹预测在不同场景下的适应性，无需依赖手动分布变化信息。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.
The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态情绪推理中忽视了情绪冲突场景，导致对音频信号的过度依赖，忽视了视觉模态的关键线索。

Method: 提出了MoSEAR框架，包含MoSE（模态特定专家）和AR（注意力重分配机制），以减少模态偏见并平衡多模态贡献。

Result: MoSEAR在多个基准测试（包括MER2023、EMER、DFEW和CA-MER）中表现出色，尤其在模态冲突条件下表现最佳。

Conclusion: MoSEAR框架通过平衡多模态集成，显著提升了在情绪冲突场景下的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow

TL;DR: CoT推理看似有效，实则是训练数据分布下的假象，超出分布时失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CoT推理是否仅是表面现象，反映从训练数据中学到的结构化归纳偏差，而非真正的推理能力。

Method: 通过任务、长度和格式三个维度分析CoT推理，并设计DataAlchemy这一隔离控制环境，系统探究不同数据分布条件下的LLM表现。

Result: 发现CoT推理在超出训练分布时失效，其有效性受训练与测试数据分布差异的限制。

Conclusion: CoT推理是一种脆弱的假象，当超出训练数据分布时其效果会消失，强调了实现真正可泛化推理的持续挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Result: 在4个CodeLlama模型和9个多样化基准的8,000个评估点上，BIS框架在代码正确性评分上的平均绝对预测误差为1.1%，最佳和最差误差分别为0.3%和1.9%。

Conclusion: BIS框架通过无真实标签的性能预测，显著降低了代码生成任务中大型语言模型（LLM）的基准测试成本和努力，展示了其可靠性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业系统中故障检测对安全和可靠性至关重要，但现有诊断模型在复杂场景（如分布偏移）下缺乏严格的风险控制和可靠的量化不确定性。

Method: 该方法将故障检测转化为假设检验任务，通过定义基于模型残差的非一致性度量，并利用校准数据集计算新样本的p值，构建数学上保证以用户指定概率（1-α）包含真实标签的预测集。故障分类通过分析构建的预测集与预定义的正常和故障标签集的交集来实现。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在跨域故障诊断任务中验证了理论特性，经验覆盖率始终达到或超过名义水平（1-α），即使在底层点预测模型表现不佳时也表现出鲁棒性。此外，研究揭示了用户定义风险水平（α）与效率之间的可控权衡，即更高的风险容忍度导致更小的平均预测集大小。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个理论基础的故障检测框架，通过显式风险控制增强了安全关键应用中诊断系统的可信度，并将该领域从简单的点预测推进到信息丰富、不确定性感知的输出。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

Conclusion: SketchAgent通过整合草图识别、符号推理和迭代验证，显著减少了手动工作，为设计、教育和工程领域的应用提供了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

Result: 在17M至202M参数的模型上，MoE-MLA-RoPE实现了68%的KV缓存内存减少和3.2倍的推理加速，同时保持竞争力的困惑度（仅下降0.8%）。与53.9M参数的模型相比，验证损失降低了6.9%，每次前向传播使用的活跃参数减少了42%。

Conclusion: MoE-MLA-RoPE通过架构创新而非参数扩展，定义了资源受限语言模型部署的效率前沿。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的成员推理攻击方法win-k，该方法在小型语言模型（SLMs）上表现优于现有攻击方法，尤其是在更小的模型上效果显著。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的出现，知识冲突在多源背景下愈发普遍。当面对多个冲突上下文（即跨上下文知识冲突）时，LLMs常因冗长且矛盾的上下文而困惑。KCR框架旨在提升LLMs解决冲突知识的能力。

Method: KCR框架通过强化学习训练骨干LLMs，使其在冲突的长文本中选择并遵循逻辑一致性更强的上下文。具体步骤包括从冲突的长文本中提取推理路径（文本或局部知识图谱），然后通过强化学习鼓励模型学习遵循正确推理路径的范式。

Result: KCR框架有效提升了模型在长文本场景下解决知识冲突的能力，实验证明了其显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，KCR框架显著提升了多种骨干模型在长文本场景下解决知识冲突的能力，带来了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

TL;DR: BioDisco 是一个多代理框架，通过语言模型和双模式证据系统生成新颖的科学假设，并通过迭代优化和时间评估验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学假设的生成过程常因信息量大和复杂性高而受阻，现有自动化方法难以生成新颖且基于证据的假设。

Method: BioDisco 结合了基于语言模型的推理和双模式证据系统（生物医学知识图谱和自动化文献检索），并集成了内部评分和反馈循环以实现迭代优化。

Result: 评估显示 BioDisco 在新颖性和显著性上优于现有代理架构的简化配置。

Conclusion: BioDisco 是一个灵活且模块化的多代理框架，能够有效生成新颖且基于证据的科学假设，并通过时间评估和人类评估验证其性能。

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

*Ma'ayan Armony,Albert Meroño-Peñuela,Gerard Canal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在规划任务中表现不佳，提出的NLP恢复管道略有提升，但与传统规划器差距显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs作为NLP模型，其规划能力存在局限性，生成的计划常包含错误或虚构动作，需系统性评估和修复。

Method: 提出一个包含NLP评估和三个阶段恢复机制的管道，通过NLP操作修复LLM生成的计划，并最终使用符号规划器完成计划。

Result: 恢复管道虽能提升动作质量和成功率，但仍无法达到传统规划器的质量和可靠性。

Conclusion: LLMs在AI任务规划中的表现仍不及传统规划器，其生成的计划质量有限，仅前2.65个动作可执行，且整体成功率仅从21.9%提升至27.5%。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

TL;DR: PUZZLED是一种新型越狱方法，利用LLM的推理能力通过字谜攻击模型，攻击成功率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在多个领域的广泛应用，确保其安全性成为关键问题，现有的越狱攻击方法通常依赖迭代提示工程或有害指令的语义转换。

Method: PUZZLED通过将有害指令中的关键词掩码，并以字谜形式呈现给LLM解决，设计了三种谜题类型：单词搜索、字谜和填字游戏。

Result: 在五个最先进的LLMs上评估PUZZLED，平均攻击成功率为88.8%，其中GPT-4.1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet的成功率分别为96.5%和92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED是一种简单但强大的攻击方法，通过利用LLMs的推理能力，将熟悉的谜题转化为有效的越狱策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模AI系统的快速发展正在重塑人与机器之间的工作分配方式。论文旨在形式化这一重新分配过程，并探索其长期均衡状态及影响。

Method: 论文通过迭代任务委派映射的形式化方法，结合格子理论（Tarski和Banach）的固定点工具，证明了至少存在一个稳定均衡，并推导了保证唯一性的单调性条件。此外，还提出了三种互补的动态基准模型（离散线性更新、进化复制动态和连续Beta分布任务谱），均收敛到相同的混合均衡。

Result: 在理论模型中，长期自动化份额的封闭形式为$x^* = \alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$，其中$\alpha$和$\beta$分别表示自动化速度和新任务出现速率。模拟结果显示，自动化比例将从2025年的约10%上升到2045年的约65%，剩余三分之一的任务由人类完成。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的职业角色——工作流指挥者，人类专注于分配、监督和整合AI模块，而非与之竞争。同时，强调了促进人-AI团队协同的政策可以引导经济向福利最大化的固定点发展。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the limitations of existing unlearning evaluation metrics
in terms of practicality, exactness, and robustness in real-world LLM

identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence
scores using a validation set. The evaluation results are quantified using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes
the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more
practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.

Result: Benchmark对当前最先进的LLM构成严峻挑战（Claude-sonnet-4的WPSR仅为34.6%）。RFT显著提升了小模型的GUI执行能力（WPSR从3.3%提升至10.8%），但在复杂场景下性能急剧下降，揭示了小模型在综合任务中的能力上限。

Conclusion: 本研究为GUI智能体领域贡献了严格的评估标准和高质数据集，旨在指导未来的发展方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

Abstract: Composable AI offers a scalable and effective paradigm for tackling complex

under this setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
CABENCH, the first public benchmark comprising 70 realistic composable AI

assessment of composable AI solutions. To establish initial baselines, we
provide human-designed reference solutions and compare their performance with
two LLM-based approaches. Our results illustrate the promise of composable AI
in addressing complex real-world problems while highlighting the need for
methods that can fully unlock its potential by automatically generating
effective execution pipelines.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于道路节点中心的框架有效解决了封闭世界假设的限制，显著提升了下一步位置预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Method: 引入TripTailor基准，包含超过500,000个真实世界POI和近4,000条多样化旅行行程，提供更真实的评估框架。

Result: 实验显示，最新LLM生成的行程中仅有不到10%达到人类水平，并揭示了旅行规划中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: TripTailor基准旨在推动旅行规划代理的发展，使其能够理解并满足用户需求，同时生成实用的行程。

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid

investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

Conclusion: CARGO框架通过联合优化路线规划和充电策略，显著降低了充电成本，同时保持了可比的交付完成率，为可持续物流中的电动车配送问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Conclusion: WinkTPG框架通过窗口机制动态优化多智能体路径执行的kinodynamic可行性，显著提升了执行质量和效率。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

Method: Refine-n-Judge 利用单一LLM作为refiner和judge，通过迭代生成和评估改进，无需额外人工标注或奖励模型。

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge 通过自动化迭代方法显著提升了数据集质量，并在多个任务中验证了其有效性，为LLM的微调提供了高质量的数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of

### [353] [Getting out of the Big-Muddy: Escalation of Commitment in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01545)
*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Paul Kröger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs的承诺升级偏见表现高度依赖社会和组织背景，而非固有特性，对多智能体系统部署有重要意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）是否继承人类的认知偏见，特别是在承诺升级（继续投资于失败的行动）方面，以及这些偏见是否在特定触发条件下表现。

Method: 通过四个实验条件（模型作为投资者、模型作为顾问、多智能体审议和复合压力场景）的两阶段投资任务，进行了N=6,500次试验。

Result: 在个体决策情境中，LLMs表现出强烈的理性成本效益逻辑，几乎没有承诺升级。然而，在多智能体审议中，不对称层级结构显示出中等升级率（46.2%），而对称的同行决策则几乎普遍升级（99.2%）。在复合压力下，模型表现出高度的承诺升级（68.95%）。

Conclusion: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的认知偏见表现高度依赖于社会和组织的背景，而非固有特性。这一发现对多智能体系统和无监督操作中的部署具有重要意义，因为这些条件下可能自然出现偏见。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Conclusion: 本文系统性地分析了语言模型（LMs）在提升表格数据准备过程中的作用，包括数据获取、集成、清洗和转换四个核心阶段，并提出了未来可能的流程方向。

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL通过分解LTL任务规范为可达-避免子目标序列，并采用逐步解决的方法，显著提升了零样本泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决静态智能体架构在复杂动态环境中的局限性，PCF 旨在通过数学基础的组合空间实现实时参数重新配置，使智能体能够动态调整其核心行为特征。

Method: PCF 利用组合逻辑、拓扑理论和粗糙模糊集理论，定义了一个多维 SPARK 参数空间（技能、个性、方法、资源、知识），并通过 LLMs 参数化复杂空间并估计可能的参数值/变异性。

Result: 通过超过 125 万次蒙特卡洛模拟，结果揭示了智能体在五个复杂度层级中的适应性和性能趋势，并在高复杂度层级中显示出收益递减现象，突出了可扩展设计的阈值。

Conclusion: PCF 框架支持生成针对特定场景优化的智能体配置，同时保持逻辑一致性，为适应性强、协作性好的下一代多态智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

The project enables rich exploration into comparative AI behavior, battle
psychology, and meta-strategy development in constrained, rule-based game
environments. Through this system, we investigate how modern LLMs understand,
adapt, and optimize decisions under uncertainty, making Pok\'emon League a
novel benchmark for AI research in strategic reasoning and competitive
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在化学相关任务中表现出潜力，但其严格的、逐步的定量推理能力仍未充分探索。QCBench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究提出了QCBench，一个包含350个计算化学问题的基准测试，覆盖7个化学子领域，并分为三个难度层次，用于系统评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。

Result: 对19个大型语言模型的评估显示，随着任务复杂度的增加，模型性能一致下降，凸显了语言流畅性与科学计算准确性之间的差距。

Conclusion: QCBench作为一个定量化学基准测试，揭示了大型语言模型在科学计算准确性方面的局限性，并为进一步改进（如领域自适应微调或多模态集成）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

TL;DR: T-GRAG是一种动态、时间感知的RAG框架，通过建模知识演化解决了现有GraphRAG方法的时间动态性问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法忽略了知识的时间动态性，导致时间模糊性、时间不敏感检索和语义冗余等问题。

Method: T-GRAG包含五个关键组件：时间知识图生成器、时间查询分解机制、三层交互检索器、源文本提取器和基于LLM的生成器。

Result: 实验表明，T-GRAG在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性方面显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: T-GRAG显著优于现有的RAG和GraphRAG基线，在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性方面表现出色，强调了知识演化建模对于稳健的长文本问答的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SURE-Med是一个系统性减少医学报告生成中视觉、分布和上下文不确定性的框架，通过三个模块分别解决不同来源的不确定性，实验证明其在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化医学报告生成（MRG）在减轻放射科医生繁重工作负担方面具有巨大潜力，但其临床部署受到视觉不确定性、标签分布不确定性和上下文不确定性的限制，这些不确定性共同影响了MRG系统的可靠性和临床可信度。

Method: SURE-Med框架包括三个模块：Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling模块用于纠正视图标注错误并选择补充视图中的信息特征；Token Sensitive Learning目标增强关键诊断句子的建模并重新加权代表性不足的诊断术语；Contextual Evidence Filter验证并选择性地整合与当前图像一致的先前信息。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SURE-Med达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过系统性地减少视觉、分布和上下文三个关键维度的不确定性，为医学报告生成设定了新的可靠性基准，并为可信赖的临床决策支持提供了坚实的一步。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2VIS方法缺乏透明性，用户无法理解设计逻辑或优化输出，因此需要一种更透明、可交互的解决方案。

Method: 设计了全面的CoT推理流程，开发了自动化的数据集增强工具，创建了nvBench-CoT数据集，并开发了DeepVIS交互界面。

Result: 定量评估、案例研究和用户研究表明，CoT框架有效提升了NL2VIS的质量，并提供了有益的用户洞察。

Conclusion: 通过整合Chain-of-Thought推理到NL2VIS流程中，研究显著提升了可视化生成的质量，并为用户提供了透明的设计过程。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调度规则效率高但僵化，深度学习方法不透明且需要复杂特征工程，而直接应用LLM存在长上下文悖论、专家启发式利用不足和短视决策三大缺陷。

Method: 提出了ReflecSched框架，通过让LLM分析多规划视野下的启发式驱动模拟，并将其提炼为简洁的自然语言总结（“战略经验”），然后集成到最终决策模块的提示中。

Result: ReflecSched在Win Rate上显著优于直接LLM基线（71.35%），Relative Percentage Deviation减少2.755%，且在所有问题案例中与最佳启发式方法表现相当。

Conclusion: ReflecSched框架通过赋予LLM战略分析能力，显著优于直接应用的LLM基线，并在所有评估的启发式方法中表现最佳，同时有效缓解了三个关键缺陷。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架HypoAgents，整合贝叶斯推理和信息熵驱动搜索机制，分三阶段（假设生成、证据验证、假设优化）模拟科学家认知过程。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个可解释的概率推理框架HypoAgents，通过多阶段闭环优化显著提升了机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

Conclusion: 该论文旨在建立一个通用的形式化框架，用于表示和比较推理系统，特别是在可能出现内部失败、适应或分裂的情况下。

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus上的广泛实验证明了所提框架的有效性和效率，以及两种输出聚合方法对提升数学推理能力的贡献。

Conclusion: 本文提出的不确定性驱动框架和两种不确定性感知输出聚合方法，显著提升了过程奖励模型的效率和数学推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试仅限于单服务器设置，无法有效评估大规模现实场景中的代理能力。

Method: 提出了LiveMCPBench，包含95个真实任务、LiveMCPTool（70个MCP服务器和527个工具）和LiveMCPEval（LLM-as-a-Judge框架），并开发了MCP Copilot Agent。

Result: 最佳模型（Claude-Sonnet-4）在LiveMCPBench中达到78.95%的成功率，但模型间性能差异显著。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench提供了首个统一的框架，用于在真实、工具丰富且动态的MCP环境中评估LLM代理，为代理能力的可扩展和可重复研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的仅依赖指标数据的方法由于正常和异常事件之间的数据不平衡，导致高误报率，增加了系统可靠性工程师的操作负担。

Method: 提出了CloudAnoAgent，一种基于神经符号LLM的代理，联合处理结构化指标和文本日志数据，并利用符号验证来验证检测假设和生成结构化异常报告。

Result: 实验结果表明，CloudAnoAgent在异常分类准确率上平均提高了46.36%和36.67%，误报率平均降低了36.67%和33.89%，异常类型检测准确率比普通LLM提示提高了12.8%。

Conclusion: CloudAnoAgent通过结合结构化指标和文本日志数据，显著提高了异常检测的准确性，降低了误报率，并增强了可解释性，适合企业云环境的实际部署。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

TL;DR: ProKG Dial 是一个利用知识图谱构建高质量领域特定多轮对话数据集的框架，显著提升了对话质量和领域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在通用NLP任务上表现优异，但在专业领域缺乏精准性。构建高质量领域特定多轮对话数据集对开发专业对话系统至关重要，但现有方法资源消耗大或对话质量和领域覆盖有限。

Method: ProKG Dial 采用渐进式框架，首先通过社区检测将知识图谱划分为语义连贯的子图，然后围绕目标实体逐步生成一系列问答，并进行严格过滤以确保对话质量。

Result: 在医学知识图谱上的验证表明，ProKG Dial 生成的对话在多样性、语义连贯性和实体覆盖方面表现优异。微调后的基础LLM在自动指标和人工评估中均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: ProKG Dial 通过利用领域特定知识图谱（KGs）构建高质量的多轮对话数据集，显著提升了对话质量和领域特定性能，验证了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注单轮NL到GQL的转换，而实际应用中用户与图数据库的交互是多轮、动态且依赖上下文的。单轮方法无法有效处理多轮对话和复杂上下文依赖，且高质量多轮NL2GQL数据集的稀缺也阻碍了该领域的进展。

Method: 本文采用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动化构建多轮NL2GQL数据集，并应用于金融市场图数据库，开发了MTGQL数据集。

Result: 开发了MTGQL数据集，并提出了三种基线方法用于评估多轮NL2GQL翻译的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的自动化方法，用于构建多轮NL2GQL数据集，并开发了MTGQL数据集。此外，提出了三种基线方法来评估多轮NL2GQL翻译的有效性，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHRs）中的非结构化临床笔记富含信息，但提取有意义特征仍具挑战性。现有方法要么依赖人工（CFG），要么完全自动化（RFG）但缺乏可解释性和临床相关性。

Method: SNOW是一个模块化多智能体系统，由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动，能够自主从非结构化临床笔记中生成结构化临床特征，无需人工干预。系统包括特征发现、提取、验证、后处理和聚合等专门智能体。

Result: SNOW在预测5年前列腺癌复发任务中表现接近人工CFG（AUC-ROC: 0.761 vs. 0.771），显著优于基线特征（0.691）和所有RFG方法。临床引导的LLM方法表现良好（0.732）但仍需专家输入。

Conclusion: 自主LLM系统（如SNOW）能够大规模复制专家级特征工程，有望改变临床机器学习模型利用非结构化EHR数据的方式，同时保持临床部署所需的可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Motivation: 为了促进基于RAG的角色扮演代理（RPA）的开发和评估，并解决知识外问题中的人设一致性挑战。

Method: AMADEUS由自适应上下文感知文本分割器（ACTS）、引导选择（GS）和属性提取器（AE）组成。ACTS为每个角色找到最佳块长度和分层上下文，AE从GS检索的块中识别角色的通用属性，并将其作为最终上下文。

Result: 构建了CharacterRAG数据集（包含15个虚构角色的976K字符和450对问答），证明框架能有效建模角色知识及属性（如个性）。

Conclusion: AMADEUS框架通过ACTS、GS和AE组件，有效建模了角色的知识和多种属性（如个性），保持了角色扮演中的人设一致性。

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

TL;DR: TraceAlign框架通过量化训练数据中的语义不一致性并提供三种干预措施，显著减少LLM对齐漂移，同时保持实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在微调后仍可能因对抗性提示或解码扰动产生不安全或违反政策的输出，需要从训练数据根源上理解和解决对齐失败问题。

Method: 提出了TraceAlign框架，包括Belief Conflict Index (BCI)量化语义不一致性，以及三种干预措施：TraceShield安全过滤器、Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss微调目标和Prov-Decode解码策略。

Result: 在Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)上，这些防御措施将对齐漂移减少了高达85%，同时标准任务上的效用损失小于0.2，并提高了拒绝质量。

Conclusion: TraceAlign提供了一个可扩展、可追踪且基于根源的工具包，用于理解和缓解对齐失败，通过一系列防御措施显著减少了对齐漂移，同时保持了模型的实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Conclusion: 该方法通过类似案例检索增强，显著提高了建筑工地风险识别的准确性和稳定性，为危险检测提供了新的理论和技朮支持。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Conclusion: SE-Agent通过自进化机制显著提升了代理的推理能力，为复杂任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly

Motivation: 解决现有机器人操作系统无法直接基于手绘草图生成3D结构的限制，降低3D建模对精确3D块姿态和专业工具（如CAD）的依赖。

Method: 系统采用抽象关系图捕捉草图中的符号几何关系和稳定性模式，并通过组合扩散模型将其转化为3D姿态，同时迭代更新以预测隐藏的内部和后部支撑结构。

Result: 在标志性建筑和现代住宅设计的草图测试中，StackItUp在稳定性和视觉相似性上均优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: StackItUp系统通过引入抽象关系图，成功将手绘草图转化为稳定的多层3D结构，显著提升了非专家用户在3D建模中的效率和效果。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

Method: 提出了吸引力元数据攻击（AMA），这是一种黑盒上下文学习框架，通过迭代优化生成高度吸引人但语法和语义有效的工具元数据。

Conclusion: 研究发现元数据操纵是一种强大且隐蔽的攻击面，强调需要超越提示级防御的执行级安全机制。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

TL;DR: DMA是一种动态掩码稀疏注意力机制，通过内容感知和位置感知的稀疏性设计，显著提升长上下文建模的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为长上下文建模的瓶颈，现有稀疏注意力机制存在静态模式或信息丢失问题。

Method: 提出了一种可训练的动态掩码稀疏注意力机制（DMA），通过内容感知和位置感知的稀疏性设计，动态生成稀疏掩码并跳过不必要的计算区域。

Result: DMA在Chinchilla Scaling Law设置下的困惑度优于多头注意力、滑动窗口注意力等方法，并在1.7B参数模型评估中表现卓越。

Conclusion: DMA通过双重稀疏设计，在保持信息完整性的同时显著降低计算复杂度，有效平衡了模型效率和长上下文建模能力。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

Motivation: 情感弧线是一种跨文化和媒介的普遍叙事结构，旨在探索如何将其作为游戏叙事生成的框架，以提升互动故事的体验。

Method: 利用叙述学理论和大规模实证分析，聚焦于“上升”和“下降”两种核心情感模式，指导分支故事图的生成。每个故事节点自动填充角色、物品和游戏相关属性，并根据情感轨迹调整难度。

Result: 通过玩家评分、访谈和情感分析评估，系统展示了情感弧线如何通过大型语言模型（LLMs）和自适应实体生成来操作化。

Conclusion: 情感弧线整合显著提升了游戏的参与度、叙事连贯性和情感影响力，突出了情感结构化程序生成在推进互动叙事方面的潜力。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

Existing approaches for improving instruction following rely on stronger
external models, creating methodological bottlenecks and practical limitations
including increased costs and accessibility constraints. We propose a

instruction following in reasoning models. The data and code are publicly

TL;DR: 论文提出双惩罚强化学习框架，通过区分内部和外部冗余来优化推理痕迹，提升效率并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）产生的冗长推理痕迹（即过度思考）影响了效率和可解释性，现有方法仅通过减少响应长度来解决问题，未充分考察推理过程的语义结构。

Method: 提出了一种双惩罚强化学习框架：采用滑动窗口语义分析惩罚内部冗余，惩罚外部冗余的比例以鼓励提前终止。

Result: 该方法显著压缩了推理痕迹且准确率损失最小，并能有效泛化到问答和代码生成等域外任务。

Conclusion: 研究发现外部冗余可以安全去除而不影响性能，而内部冗余需谨慎减少以避免损害正确性。该方法不仅提高了推理效率，还实现了对思维链长度的隐式语义控制。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种受大脑启发的三部分架构，整合时间动态，显著提升了人工认知的灵活性和效率，初步验证效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工神经网络具有显著能力，但其灵活性和泛化智能有限，这源于其与生物认知的根本差异，忽视了神经区域的功能专门化和时间动态。

Method: 提出了一种三部分受大脑启发的架构，包括功能专门化的感知、辅助和执行系统，并通过模拟多频率神经振荡和突触动态适应机制整合时间动态。

Result: 初步评估显示，该架构在视觉处理任务上表现优于现有时间处理方法，准确率提高2.18%，计算迭代减少48.44%，且与人类置信模式相关性更高。

Conclusion: 该架构为跨认知领域的类脑智能奠定了理论基础，有望缩小人工与生物智能之间的差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Motivation: 解决在具有认知不确定性的环境中，传统KL控制代理在规划和探索效率上的不足。

Method: 通过将EFE最小化重新表述为带有认知先验的变分自由能最小化，将组合搜索问题转化为可处理的推断问题，并应用消息传递方法进行高效策略推断。

Result: 在随机网格世界和部分可观察的Minigrid任务中，基于EFE最小化的代理表现出更稳健的规划和更高效的探索能力。

Conclusion: 该方法将主动推理理论与实际应用相结合，为人工智能代理中认知先验的效率提供了实证支持。

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual design of ATC training scenarios is time-consuming and limits simulation diversity. The paper aims to automate and enhance this process using LLMs.

Method: The paper introduces AirTrafficGen, an end-to-end approach that uses a graph-based representation to encode sector topology for LLMs. It employs state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 for scenario generation, with engineered prompting for fine-grained control.

Result: Benchmarking shows that LLMs can generate high-traffic ATC scenarios with operational realism, capable of iterative refinement based on textual feedback.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for automating complex planning tasks in safety-critical domains like Air Traffic Control (ATC), providing a scalable alternative to manual scenario design.

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在复杂任务中生成的思维链存在过度冗余问题，根源在于后训练过度依赖结果奖励范式，而过程奖励范式的数据难以大规模构建。

Method: 提出了PI框架，包括动态指导推理路径的三个模块：When（时机）、How（方式）和Which（后干预采样）。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，PI显著缩短了CoTs并减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: PI框架通过在推理过程中动态指导和调节思维链，显著缩短了CoTs并减少了幻觉，产生了更简洁可靠的推理。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多模态大语言模型和参数高效微调，实现了新生儿MRI扫描中PMA的高精度预测和临床解释生成，提升了AI系统的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在预测PMA时缺乏透明度和可解释性，难以满足临床决策支持的需求。

Method: 采用参数高效微调（PEFT）策略，结合指令调优和低秩适应（LoRA）技术，对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行微调，训练数据为四种2D皮质表面投影图。

Result: 微调后的模型实现了较低的预测误差（95%置信区间为0.78至1.52周），并能生成基于发育特征的可解释输出。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和参数高效微调策略，在新生儿MRI扫描中实现了高精度的PMA预测和临床相关解释生成，为围产期神经科学中的透明和可信AI系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂数学推理任务中表现不佳，因其依赖深层结构关系。CAMA旨在通过显式、可重用的数学结构解决这一挑战。

Method: CAMA采用两阶段框架：学习阶段通过因果发现算法构建数学因果图（MCG），并基于反馈迭代优化；推理阶段动态提取任务相关子图，注入LLM以指导推理。

Result: 实证结果表明，CAMA显著提升了LLM在数学问题上的性能，结构化指导和不对称因果关系的引入优于非结构化方法。

Conclusion: CAMA框架通过两阶段因果推理方法显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂数学推理任务中的表现，证明了结构化指导和不对称因果关系的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了AI代理在电子商务环境中的行为模式，并提出了具体的卖家策略、平台设计和监管问题，为AI中介生态系统提供了实际见解。

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种不直接依赖训练数据的可操作反事实解释方法，通过贝叶斯网络估计数据密度，提高了高风险场景下的公平性和可解释性。实验证明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

Result: 在RoboMimic基准测试中，D2PPO在预训练和微调后分别平均提升了22.7%和26.1%，并在真实机器人实验中表现出高成功率。

Conclusion: D2PPO通过引入分散损失正则化，有效解决了扩散策略中的表示崩溃问题，显著提升了复杂机器人操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

Abstract: Load balancing is among the basic primitives in distributed computing. In
this paper, we consider this problem when executed locally on a network with
nodes prone to failures. We show that there exist lightweight network
topologies that are immune to message delivery failures incurred by (at most) a
constant fraction of all nodes. More precisely, we design a novel deterministic
fault-tolerant local load balancing (LLB) algorithm, which, similarly to their
classical counterparts working in fault-free networks, has a relatively simple
structure and guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the average value
despite crash and omission failures.
  As the second part of our contribution, we show three applications of the
newly developed fault-tolerant local load balancing protocol. We give a
randomized consensus algorithm, working against $t < n / 3$ crash failures,
that improves over the best-known consensus solution by Hajiaghayi et al. with
respect to communication complexity, yet with an arguable simpler technique of
combining a randomly and locally selected virtual communication graph with a
deterministic fault-tolerant local load balancing on this graph.
  We also give a new solution for consensus for networks with omission
failures. Our solution works against $t < \frac{n}{C\log{n} (\log\log n)^2}$
omissions, for some constant $C$, is nearly optimal in terms of time
complexity, but most notably -- it has communication complexity $O((t^2 +
n)\text{ polylog } {n})$, matching, within a polylogarithmic factor, the lower
bound by Abraham et. al. with respect to both terms depending on $t$ and $n$.
Ours is the first algorithm in the literature that is simultaneously nearly
optimal, in terms of $n,t$, with respect to both complexity measures, against
the adaptive omission-causing adversary.

Motivation: 解决Δ-着色问题的确定性复杂度，以匹配当前(Δ+1)-着色的最优上界。

Method: 开发了一种从Δ-着色到MIS的归约方法，确保Δ-着色的复杂度不超过MIS的复杂度，除非MIS可以在亚对数时间内解决。

Result: Δ-着色问题可以在O~(log^{5/3}n)轮内确定性解决，与MIS问题的复杂度相同。

Conclusion: 本文通过将Δ-着色问题归约到MIS问题，证明了Δ-着色问题的确定性复杂度与MIS问题相同，达到了目前(Δ+1)-着色的最优上界，即O~(log^{5/3}n)轮。

Abstract: Recent improvements on the deterministic complexities of fundamental graph
problems in the LOCAL model of distributed computing have yielded
state-of-the-art upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds for maximal
independent set (MIS) and $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring [Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24]
and $\tilde{O}(\log^{19/9} n)$ rounds for the more restrictive
$\Delta$-coloring problem [Ghaffari, Kuhn, FOCS'21; Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24;
Bourreau, Brandt, Nolin, STOC'25]. In our work, we show that $\Delta$-coloring
can be solved deterministically in $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds as well,
matching the currently best bound for $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring.
  We achieve our result by developing a reduction from $\Delta$-coloring to MIS
that guarantees that the (asymptotic) complexity of $\Delta$-coloring is at
most the complexity of MIS, unless MIS can be solved in sublogarithmic time, in
which case, due to the $\Omega(\log n)$-round $\Delta$-coloring lower bound
from [BFHKLRSU, STOC'16], our reduction implies a tight complexity of
$\Theta(\log n)$ for $\Delta$-coloring. In particular, any improvement on the
complexity of the MIS problem will yield the same improvement for the
complexity of $\Delta$-coloring (up to the true complexity of
$\Delta$-coloring).
  Our reduction yields improvements for $\Delta$-coloring in the randomized
LOCAL model and when complexities are parameterized by both $n$ and $\Delta$.
We obtain a randomized complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} \log n)$
rounds (improving over the state of the art of $\tilde{O}(\log^{8/3} \log n)$
rounds) on general graphs and tight complexities of $\Theta(\log n)$ and
$\Theta(\log \log n)$ for the deterministic, resp.\ randomized, complexity on
bounded-degree graphs. In the special case of graphs of constant clique number
(which for instance include bipartite graphs), we also give a reduction to the
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring problem.

Abstract: Blockchain technology has advanced rapidly in recent years and is now widely
used in a variety of fields. Blockchain appears to be one of the best solutions
for managing massive heterogeneous devices while achieving advanced data
security and data reputation, particularly in the field of large-scale IoT
(Internet of Things) networks. Despite the numerous advantages, there are still
challenges while deploying IoT applications on blockchain systems due to the
limited storage, power, and computing capability of IoT devices, and some of
these problems are caused by the consensus algorithm, which plays a significant
role in blockchain systems by ensuring overall system reliability and
robustness. Nonetheless, most existing consensus algorithms are prone to poor
node reliability, low transaction per second (TPS) rates, and scalability
issues. Aiming at some critical problems in the existing consensus algorithms,
this paper proposes the Efficient Byzantine Reputation-based Consensus (EBRC)
mechanism to resolve the issues raised above. In comparison to traditional
algorithms, we reinvented ways to evaluate node reliability and robustness and
manage active nodes. Our experiments show that the EBRC algorithm has lower
consensus delay, higher throughput, improved security, and lower verification
costs. It offers new reference ideas for solving the Internet of
Things+blockchain+Internet court construction problem.

Abstract: In the future 6G and wireless networks, particularly in dense urban
environments, bandwidth exhaustion and limited capacity pose significant
challenges to enhancing data rates. We introduce a novel system model designed
to improve the data rate of users in next-generation multi-cell networks by
integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Assisted Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surfaces (RIS), Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), and Coordinated
Multipoint Transmission (CoMP). Optimally deploying Aerial RIS for higher data
rates, employing NOMA to improve spectral efficiency, and utilizing CoMP to
mitigate inter-cell interference (ICI), we significantly enhance the overall
system capacity and sum rate. Furthermore, we address the challenge of feedback
overhead associated with Quantized Phase Shifts (QPS) from the receiver to RIS.
The feedback channel is band-limited and cannot support a large overhead of QPS
for uplink communication. To ensure seamless transmission, we propose a Machine
Learning Autoencoder technique for a compressed communication of QPS from the
receiver to RIS, while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, we investigate
the impact of the number of Aerial RIS elements and power allocation ratio for
NOMA on the individual data rate of users. Our simulation results demonstrate
substantial improvements in spectral efficiency, outage probability, and
bandwidth utilization, highlighting the potential of the proposed architecture
to enhance network performance.

Result: 实验显示，TaiChi在平衡的TTFT和TPOT SLOs下比现有系统提高了77%的吞吐量。

Conclusion: TaiChi系统通过统一的预填充-解码聚合与解聚架构，在不同服务级别目标（SLOs）下实现了最优的吞吐量，尤其在平衡的TTFT和TPOT SLOs下表现卓越。

Abstract: An ongoing debate considers whether prefill-decode (PD) aggregation or
disaggregation is superior for serving large language models (LLMs). This has
driven optimizations for both approaches, each showing distinct advantages.
This paper compares PD aggregation and disaggregation, showing that each excels
under different service-level objectives (SLOs): aggregation is optimal for
tight time-to-first-token (TTFT) and relaxed time-per-output-token (TPOT),
while disaggregation excels for strict TPOT and relaxed TTFT. However, under
balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs, neither approach delivers optimal goodput.
  This paper proposes TaiChi, an LLM serving system that unifies PD
disaggregation and aggregation for optimal goodput under any combination of
TTFT and TPOT SLOs. TaiChi uses a unified disaggregation-aggregation
architecture with differentiated-capability GPU instances: prefill-heavy (fast
prefill, high-interference decode) and decode-heavy (low-interference decode,
slow prefill). Three configurable sliders control the ratio between these
instances and their chunk sizes. TaiChi adapts to various SLO regimes by
adjusting sliders. When TTFT constraints are tight, TaiChi resembles a PD
aggregation configuration; when TPOT dominates, it adapts toward PD
disaggregation. Crucially, under balanced SLOs, TaiChi enables a hybrid mode
for superior goodput. The key innovation behind this hybrid mode is latency
shifting: selectively reallocating GPU resources from requests that meet SLOs
to those at risk of violation, maximizing the number of SLO-satisfied requests.
This fine-grained latency shifting is orchestrated by two scheduling
mechanisms: flowing decode scheduling to control TPOTs and length-aware prefill
scheduling to manage TTFTs, which jointly optimize request assignment. Our
experiments show TaiChi improves goodput by up to 77% over state-of-the-art
systems under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs.

Conclusion: DySTop 通过动态陈旧性控制和拓扑结构优化，显著提升了异步去中心化联邦学习的效率，减少了完成时间和通信资源消耗，同时保持了模型准确性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a potential distributed learning
paradigm that enables model training on edge devices (i.e., workers) while
preserving data privacy. However, its reliance on a centralized server leads to
limited scalability. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) eliminates the
dependency on a centralized server by enabling peer-to-peer model exchange.
Existing DFL mechanisms mainly employ synchronous communication, which may
result in training inefficiencies under heterogeneous and dynamic edge
environments. Although a few recent asynchronous DFL (ADFL) mechanisms have
been proposed to address these issues, they typically yield stale model
aggregation and frequent model transmission, leading to degraded training
performance on non-IID data and high communication overhead. To overcome these
issues, we present DySTop, an innovative mechanism that jointly optimizes
dynamic staleness control and topology construction in ADFL. In each round,
multiple workers are activated, and a subset of their neighbors is selected to
transmit models for aggregation, followed by local training. We provide a
rigorous convergence analysis for DySTop, theoretically revealing the
quantitative relationships between the convergence bound and key factors such
as maximum staleness, activating frequency, and data distribution among
workers. From the insights of the analysis, we propose a worker activation
algorithm (WAA) for staleness control and a phase-aware topology construction
algorithm (PTCA) to reduce communication overhead and handle data non-IID.
Extensive evaluations through both large-scale simulations and real-world
testbed experiments demonstrate that our DySTop reduces completion time by
51.8% and the communication resource consumption by 57.1% compared to
state-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same model accuracy.

Abstract: With an ever growing number of heterogeneous applicational services running
on equally heterogeneous computational systems, the problem of resource
management becomes more essential. Although current solutions consider some
network and time requirements, they mostly handle a pre-defined list of
resource types by design and, consequently, fail to provide an extensible
solution to assess any other set of requirements or to switch strategies on its
resource estimation. This work proposes an heuristics-based estimation solution
to support any computational system as a self-assessment, including
considerations on dynamically weighting the requirements, how to compute each
node's capacity towards an admission request, and also offers the possibility
to extend the list of resource types considered for assessment, which is an
uncommon view in related works. This algorithm can be used by distributed and
centralized resource allocation protocols to decide the best node(s) for a
service intended for deployment. This approach was validated across its
components and the results show that its performance is straightforward in
resource estimation while allowing scalability and extensibility.

Result: 实验结果表明，FedAPTA在性能上优于九种现有的SOTA联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: FedAPTA显著优于现有的联邦学习方法，性能提升高达4.23%。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has shown considerable promise in Computing Power
Networks (CPNs) for privacy protection, efficient data utilization, and dynamic
collaboration. Although it offers practical benefits, applying FL in CPNs
continues to encounter a major obstacle, i.e., multi-task deployment. However,
existing work mainly focuses on mitigating FL's computation and communication
overhead of a single task while overlooking the computing resource wastage
issue of heterogeneous devices across multiple tasks in FL under CPNs. To
tackle this, we design FedAPTA, a federated multi-task learning framework in
CPNs. FedAPTA alleviates computing resource wastage through the developed
layer-wise model pruning technique, which reduces local model size while
considering both data and device heterogeneity. To aggregate structurally
heterogeneous local models of different tasks, we introduce a heterogeneous
model recovery strategy and a task-aware model aggregation method that enables
the aggregation through infilling local model architecture with the shared
global model and clustering local models according to their specific tasks. We
deploy FedAPTA on a realistic FL platform and benchmark it against nine SOTA FL
methods. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed FedAPTA
considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art FL methods by up to 4.23%. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Zhenzovo/FedCPN.

TL;DR: PUSHtap结合CPU和PIM访问，通过统一数据格式和扩展PIM架构，显著提升HTAP系统的OLAP/OLTP性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTAP系统中OLTP和OLAP对数据格式的不同需求导致性能隔离、数据新鲜度和工作负载特定优化的矛盾。PIM技术为加速内存密集型工作负载提供了可能。

Method: 提出了统一的数据存储格式、数据对齐和放置技术，实现了MVCC，并扩展了商业PIM架构以支持OLAP操作和并发访问。

Result: PUSHtap在OLAP和OLTP吞吐量上比基于多实例PIM的设计分别提升了3.4倍和4.4倍。

Conclusion: PUSHtap通过结合CPU和PIM单元的访问方式，解决了HTAP系统中的数据格式矛盾，显著提升了OLAP和OLTP的性能。

Abstract: Hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) is an emerging database
paradigm that supports both online transaction processing (OLTP) and online
analytical processing (OLAP) workloads. Computing-intensive OLTP operations,
involving row-wise data manipulation, are suitable for row-store format. In
contrast, memory-intensive OLAP operations, which are column-centric, benefit
from column-store format. This \emph{data-format dilemma} prevents HTAP systems
from concurrently achieving three design goals: performance isolation, data
freshness, and workload-specific optimization. Another background technology is
Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computing units (PIM units) inside
DRAM memory devices to accelerate memory-intensive workloads, including OLAP.
  Our key insight is to combine the interleaved CPU access and localized PIM
unit access to provide two-dimensional access to address the data format
contradictions inherent in HTAP. First, we propose a unified data storage
format with novel data alignment and placement techniques to optimize the
effective bandwidth of CPUs and PIM units and exploit the PIM's parallelism.
Second, we implement the multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) essential for
single-instance HTAP. Third, we extend the commercial PIM architecture to
support the OLAP operations and concurrent access from PIM and CPU. Experiments
show that PUSHtap can achieve 3.4\texttimes{}/4.4\texttimes{} OLAP/OLTP
throughput improvement compared to multi-instance PIM-based design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D网状和交叉开关互连在带宽扩展、延迟和面积效率方面存在局限性，阻碍了多核低延迟共享内存集群的扩展。

Method: TeraNoC结合了32位字宽多通道2D网状和交叉开关拓扑，设计了路由器重映射器以平衡互连通道的流量负载。

Result: 在12nm技术中实现的1024核集群中，TeraNoC实现了高达0.85 IPC的计算利用率，功耗和面积效率显著优于纯交叉开关集群。

Conclusion: TeraNoC是一种开源的混合网状-交叉开关片上互连技术，成功解决了在保持低延迟和高面积效率的同时扩展带宽的挑战。

Abstract: A key challenge in on-chip interconnect design is to scale up bandwidth while
maintaining low latency and high area efficiency. 2D-meshes scale with low
wiring area and congestion overhead; however, their end-to-end latency
increases with the number of hops, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive
core-to-L1-memory access. On the other hand, crossbars offer low latency, but
their routing complexity grows quadratically with the number of I/Os, requiring
large physical routing resources and limiting area-efficient scalability. This
two-sided interconnect bottleneck hinders the scale-up of many-core,
low-latency, tightly coupled shared-memory clusters, pushing designers toward
instantiating many smaller and loosely coupled clusters, at the cost of
hardware and software overheads. We present TeraNoC, an open-source, hybrid
mesh-crossbar on-chip interconnect that offers both scalability and low
latency, while maintaining very low routing overhead. The topology, built on
32bit word-width multi-channel 2D-meshes and crossbars, enables the
area-efficient scale-up of shared-memory clusters. A router remapper is
designed to balance traffic load across interconnect channels. Using TeraNoC,
we build a cluster with 1024 single-stage, single-issue cores that share a
4096-banked L1 memory, implemented in 12nm technology. The low interconnect
stalls enable high compute utilization of up to 0.85 IPC in compute-intensive,
data-parallel key GenAI kernels. TeraNoC only consumes 7.6\% of the total
cluster power in kernels dominated by crossbar accesses, and 22.7\% in kernels
with high 2D-mesh traffic. Compared to a hierarchical crossbar-only cluster,
TeraNoC reduces die area by 37.8\% and improves area efficiency (GFLOP/s/mm2)
by up to 98.7\%, while occupying only 10.9\% of the logic area.

Motivation: 随着LLM通过MoE扩展和AI硬件（如Huawei CloudMatrix384 SuperPod）的升级，运行大型MoE模型带来了新的挑战，需要新的执行模型和系统级解决方案。

Method: xDeepServe采用Transformerless架构，将Transformer模型分解为注意力、前馈和MoE模块，独立在NPU上执行，并通过XCCL通信库实现高效通信。

Conclusion: xDeepServe通过Transformerless架构和XCCL通信库，成功解决了在SuperPod规模硬件上运行大型MoE模型的新挑战，实现了计算和内存的独立扩展，同时不牺牲性能。

Abstract: The rise of scaled-out LLMs and scaled-up SuperPods signals a new era in
large-scale AI infrastructure. LLMs continue to scale out via MoE, as seen in
recent models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen. In parallel, AI hardware is
scaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s
high-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware
brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling,
efficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure.
This paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for
SuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated
architecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention,
feedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed
fabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and
disaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent
scaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this
architecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages
CloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and
all-to-all primitives. We also extend our serving engine FlowServe with
system-level techniques, enabling scalable inference across hundreds of NPUs.

Abstract: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that has applications in many
domains such as cryptocurrency, smart contracts, supply chain management, and
many others. Distributed consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain
systems that enables secure, precise, and tamper-proof verification of data
without relying on central authorities. Existing consensus protocols,
nevertheless, suffer from drawbacks, some of which are related to scalability,
resource consumption, and fault tolerance. We introduce Blockchain Epidemic
Consensus Protocol (BECP), a novel fully decentralised consensus protocol for
blockchain networks at a large scale. BECP follows epidemic communication
principles, without fixed roles like validators or leaders, and achieves
probabilistic convergence, efficient message dissemination, and tolerance to
message delays. We provide an extensive experimental comparison of BECP against
classic protocols like PAXOS, RAFT, and PBFT, and newer epidemic-based
protocols like Avalanche and Snowman. The findings indicate that BECP provides
desirable gains in throughput, consensus latency, and substantial
message-passing efficiency compared to existing epidemic-based approaches,
validating its usability as an effective and scalable approach for

Abstract: Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger technology that has been
widely adopted in many sectors for various applications such as
cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and supply chain management. Distributed
consensus is a fundamental component of blockchain, which is required to ensure
trust, security, and integrity of the data stored and the transactions
processed in the blockchain. Various consensus algorithms have been developed,
each affected from certain issues such as node failures, high resource
consumption, collusion, etc. This work introduces a fully decentralised
consensus protocol, Blockchain Epidemic Consensus Protocol (BECP), suitable for
very large and extreme-scale blockchain systems. The proposed approach
leverages the benefits of epidemic protocols, such as no reliance on a fixed
set of validators or leaders, probabilistic guarantees of convergence,
efficient use of network resources, and tolerance to node and network failures.
A comparative experimental analysis has been carried out with traditional
protocols including PAXOS, RAFT, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
(PBFT), as well as a relatively more recent protocol such as Avalanche, which
is specifically designed for very large-scale systems. The results illustrate
how BECP outperforms them in terms of throughput, scalability and consensus
latency. BECP achieves an average of 1.196 times higher throughput in terms of
consensus on items and 4.775 times better average consensus latency.
Furthermore, BECP significantly reduces the number of messages compared to
Avalanche. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of fully
decentralised consensus for blockchain technology based on epidemic protocols.

TL;DR: 本文探索了两种集成学习预测到LSM-tree的方法：分类器减少查询延迟，学习模型减少内存占用，实验显示显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代键值存储依赖LSM-tree进行写入优化，但导致显著的读取放大。传统辅助结构如Bloom过滤器虽有效但内存成本高，学习数据结构可能提供更优解决方案。

Method: 第一种方法使用分类器选择性绕过Bloom过滤器探测以减少查询延迟；第二种方法用紧凑学习模型和小型备份过滤器替代传统Bloom过滤器以减少内存占用。两种方法均在Monkey风格LSM-tree上实现并测试。

Result: 分类器方法将GET延迟降低至多2.28倍，跳过30%的Bloom过滤器检查；学习Bloom过滤器设计实现零假阴性，内存占用减少70-80%，同时保持基线延迟。

Conclusion: 本文展示了两种将学习预测集成到LSM-tree查找路径中的方法，分别针对减少查询延迟和内存占用，证明了学习索引组件在写入优化存储系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern key-value stores rely heavily on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees for
write optimization, but this design introduces significant read amplification.
Auxiliary structures like Bloom filters help, but impose memory costs that
scale with tree depth and dataset size. Recent advances in learned data
structures suggest that machine learning models can augment or replace these
components, trading handcrafted heuristics for data-adaptive behavior. In this
work, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the
LSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom
filter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query
latency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned
models and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without
compromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style
LSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic
workloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up
to 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision,
though it incurs a modest false-negative rate. The learned Bloom filter design
achieves zero false negatives and retains baseline latency while cutting memory
usage per level by 70-80%. Together, these designs illustrate complementary
trade-offs between latency, memory, and correctness, and highlight the
potential of learned index components in write-optimized storage systems.

Motivation: 随着数据探索实践的演化和大规模高维数据集的普及，直接访问排名检索（DAR）问题面临新的挑战。传统方法无法高效访问任意排名位置的元组，因此需要新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of Direct-Access Ranked Retrieval (DAR) for interactive
data tooling, where evolving data exploration practices, combined with
large-scale and high-dimensional datasets, create new challenges. DAR concerns
the problem of enabling efficient access to arbitrary rank positions according
to a ranking function, without enumerating all preceding tuples. To address
this need, we formalize the DAR problem and propose a theoretically efficient
algorithm based on geometric arrangements, achieving logarithmic query time.
However, this method suffers from exponential space complexity in high
dimensions. Therefore, we develop a second class of algorithms based on
$\varepsilon$-sampling, which consume a linear space. Since exactly locating
the tuple at a specific rank is challenging due to its connection to the range
counting problem, we introduce a relaxed variant called Conformal Set Ranked
Retrieval (CSR), which returns a small subset guaranteed to contain the target
tuple. To solve the CSR problem efficiently, we define an intermediate problem,
Stripe Range Retrieval (SRR), and design a hierarchical sampling data structure
tailored for narrow-range queries. Our method achieves practical scalability in
both data size and dimensionality. We prove near-optimal bounds on the
efficiency of our algorithms and validate their performance through extensive
experiments on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating scalability to
millions of tuples and hundreds of dimensions.

Abstract: We study the computational complexity of locally estimating a node's PageRank
centrality in a directed graph $G$. For any node $t$, its PageRank centrality
$\pi(t)$ is defined as the probability that a random walk in $G$, starting from
a uniformly chosen node, terminates at $t$, where each step terminates with a
constant probability $\alpha\in(0,1)$.
  To obtain a multiplicative $\big(1\pm O(1)\big)$-approximation of $\pi(t)$
with probability $\Omega(1)$, the previously best upper bound is
$O(n^{1/2}\min\{ \Delta_{in}^{1/2},\Delta_{out}^{1/2},m^{1/4}\})$ from [Wang,
Wei, Wen, Yang STOC '24], where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of nodes and
edges in $G$, and $\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ upper bound the in-degrees
and out-degrees of $G$, respectively. The same paper implicitly gives the
previously best lower bound of
$\Omega(n^{1/2}\min\{\Delta_{in}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},\Delta_{out}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},m^{1/4}\})$,
where $\gamma=\frac{\log(1/(1-\alpha))}{4\log\Delta_{in}-2\log(1/(1-\alpha))}$
if $\Delta_{in}>1/(1-\alpha)$, and $\gamma=1/2$ if
$\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$. As $\gamma$ only depends on $\Delta_{in}$, the
known upper bound is tight if we only parameterize the complexity by $n$, $m$,
and $\Delta_{out}$. However, there remains a gap of $\Omega(n^{\gamma})$ when
considering $\Delta_{in}$, and this gap is large when $\Delta_{in}$ is small.
In the extreme case where $\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$, we have $\gamma=1/2$,
leading to a gap of $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ between the bounds $O(n^{1/2})$ and
$\Omega(1)$.
  In this paper, we present a new algorithm that achieves the above lower bound
(up to logarithmic factors). The algorithm assumes that $n$ and the bounds
$\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ are known in advance. Our key technique is a
novel randomized backwards propagation process which only propagates
selectively based on Monte Carlo estimated PageRank scores.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种时间复杂度为O(n^2.773203)的矩阵乘法算法，适用于实际输入规模，并在小基例中表现最佳，通过优化方法为实际应用奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有快速矩阵乘法算法大多仅适用于极大矩阵（n>10^100），而Pan算法虽然是可行输入中最快的，但仍存在优化空间。本文旨在提出一种更快的算法，适用于实际应用中的输入规模。

Method: 采用三线性聚合方法，利用de Groote等价性替换算法中的部分，并通过稀疏分解和降低主导系数来优化加性复杂度。

Result: 新算法的时间复杂度为O(n^2.773203)，在基例小于1000时表现最佳，并在n0=28时即展示出优越性。此外，对于更大的基例，算法也获得了更好的指数表现。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的矩阵乘法算法，其时间复杂度为O(n^2.773203)，适用于与Pan算法相同的输入规模，并且在多种小基例中表现最佳。通过改进加性复杂度和优化算法，为实际应用中超越现有快速矩阵乘法算法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental kernel in high performance computing.
Many algorithms for fast matrix multiplication can only be applied to enormous
matrices ($n>10^{100}$) and thus cannot be used in practice. Of all algorithms
applicable to feasible input, Pan's $O(n^{2.773372})$ algorithm (1982) is
asymptotically the fastest. We obtain an $O(n^{2.773203})$ algorithm applicable
to the same input sizes as Pan's algorithm. This algorithm is the fastest
matrix multiplication algorithm with base case smaller than $1000$. Further,
our method obtains the best asymptotic complexity for many small base cases,
starting at $n_0=28$. We also obtain better exponents for larger base cases. To
construct our algorithm, we use the trilinear aggregation method. We find parts
of the algorithms that are equivalent to matrix multiplication with smaller
base case, and use the de Groote equivalence to replace these parts in a way
that allows further optimization of our algorithms. Finally, we improve the
additive complexity of our algorithms by finding a sparse decomposition and
reducing the leading coefficient. These mark a fundamental step towards
outperforming existing fast matrix multiplication algorithms in practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型多维AboveThreshold（MAT）机制，解决了传统稀疏向量技术（SVT）在图算法中的误差放大问题，并在k-core分解、最密子图等图问题上实现了更优的边界。


<details>

Motivation: 传统稀疏向量技术（SVT）在图设置中因组合而导致的误差放大问题（误差被放大n倍）限制了其在图算法中的应用。作者希望通过提出一种新的机制来解决这一问题，并在多个图问题上实现更优的边界。

Abstract: Many differentially private and classical non-private graph algorithms rely
crucially on determining whether some property of each vertex meets a
threshold. For example, for the $k$-core decomposition problem, the classic
peeling algorithm iteratively removes a vertex if its induced degree falls
below a threshold. The sparse vector technique (SVT) is generally used to
transform non-private threshold queries into private ones with only a small
additive loss in accuracy. However, a naive application of SVT in the graph
setting leads to an amplification of the error by a factor of $n$ due to
composition, as SVT is applied to every vertex. In this paper, we resolve this
problem by formulating a novel generalized sparse vector technique which we
call the Multidimensional AboveThreshold (MAT) Mechanism which generalizes SVT
(applied to vectors with one dimension) to vectors with multiple dimensions. As
an application, we solve a number of important graph problems with better
bounds than previous work.
  We apply our MAT mechanism to obtain a set of improved bounds for a variety
of problems including $k$-core decomposition, densest subgraph, low out-degree
ordering, and vertex coloring. We give a tight local edge DP algorithm for
$k$-core decomposition with $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ additive error and no
multiplicative error in $O(n)$ rounds. We also give a new $(2+\eta)$-factor
multiplicative, $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ additive error algorithm in $O(\log^2
n)$ rounds for any constant $\eta > 0$. Both of these results are
asymptotically tight against our new lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ for any
constant-factor approximation algorithm for $k$-core decomposition. Our new
algorithms for $k$-core also directly lead to new algorithms for densest
subgraph and low out-degree ordering. Our novel private defective coloring
algorithms uses number of colors proportional to the arboricity of the graph.

Abstract: A cover (or quasiperiod) of a string $S$ is a shorter string $C$ such that
every position of $S$ is contained in some occurrence of $C$ as a substring.
The notion of covers was introduced by Apostolico and Ehrenfeucht over 30 years
ago [Theor. Comput. Sci. 1993] and it has received significant attention from
the combinatorial pattern matching community. In this note, we show how to
efficiently test whether $S$ admits a cover. Our tester can also be translated
into a streaming algorithm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典聚类问题对异常值高度敏感，且无约束的异常值排除可能导致某些群体被不公平地排除，从而引发公平性问题。

Method: 提出了双标准近似算法，分别为设施位置和k-中位数问题设计了不同的近似因子和异常值违反比例。

Result: 提出了双标准近似算法，设施位置问题的近似因子为O(1/ε)，异常值违反比例为(1+2ε)；k-中位数问题的近似因子为4(1+ω/ε)，异常值违反比例为(ω+ε)。

Conclusion: 论文证明了在设施位置和k-中位数问题中，通过引入公平性约束，可以在成本增加可忽略的情况下实现公平性，并通过实证分析验证了标准线性规划的整数间隙较小。

Abstract: Classical clustering problems such as \emph{Facility Location} and
\emph{$k$-Median} aim to efficiently serve a set of clients from a subset of
facilities -- minimizing the total cost of facility openings and client
assignments in Facility Location, and minimizing assignment (service) cost
under a facility count constraint in $k$-Median. These problems are highly
sensitive to outliers, and therefore researchers have studied variants that
allow excluding a small number of clients as outliers to reduce cost. However,
in many real-world settings, clients belong to different demographic or
functional groups, and unconstrained outlier removal can disproportionately
exclude certain groups, raising fairness concerns.
  We study \emph{Facility Location with Fair Outliers}, where each group is
allowed a specified number of outliers, and the objective is to minimize total
cost while respecting group-wise fairness constraints. We present a bicriteria
approximation with a $O(1/\epsilon)$ approximation factor and $(1+ 2\epsilon)$
factor violation in outliers per group. For \emph{$k$-Median with Fair
Outliers}, we design a bicriteria approximation with a $4(1+\omega/\epsilon)$
approximation factor and $(\omega + \epsilon)$ violation in outliers per group
improving on prior work by avoiding dependence on $k$ in outlier violations. We
also prove that the problems are W[1]-hard parameterized by $\omega$, assuming
the Exponential Time Hypothesis.
  We complement our algorithmic contributions with a detailed empirical
analysis, demonstrating that fairness can be achieved with negligible increase
in cost and that the integrality gap of the standard LP is small in practice.

Method: 引入均匀性跟踪问题，并开发了一种基于泊松混合物结构的新算法。

Result: 提出了一种与最优算法相比具有竞争性的均匀性跟踪算法，其竞争力为多对数级别。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的均匀性跟踪算法，通过利用泊松混合物的新结构结果，实现了与最优算法相比的竞争性性能。

Abstract: In the uniformity testing task, an algorithm is provided with samples from an
unknown probability distribution over a (known) finite domain, and must decide
whether it is the uniform distribution, or, alternatively, if its total
variation distance from uniform exceeds some input distance parameter. This
question has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is,
by now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of
interest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a
prespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance.
  To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity
tracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity
(however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be
competitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in
hindsight. Our main contribution is a
$\operatorname{polylog}(\operatorname{opt})$-competitive uniformity tracking
algorithm. We obtain this result by leveraging new structural results on
Poisson mixtures, which we believe to be of independent interest.

Abstract: Managing connectivity in integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicular networks
is critical for 6G, yet is challenged by dynamic conditions and partial
observability. This letter introduces the Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with
Satellite-Aided Multi-head self-attention (MAAC-SAM), a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework that enables vehicles to autonomously manage
connectivity across Vehicle-to-Satellite (V2S), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure

integration of a multi-head attention mechanism, which allows for robust state
estimation even with fluctuating and limited information sharing among
vehicles. The framework further leverages self-imitation learning (SIL) and
fingerprinting to improve learning efficiency and real-time decisions.
Simulation results, based on realistic SUMO traffic models and 3GPP-compliant

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCN作为一种新型网络架构，旨在解决传统IP网络模型的固有局限性。通过优化编码数据存储和传输策略，可以进一步提升CCN的性能。

Method: 提出了一系列对CCN架构的基本修改，包括集成DCC技术、针对用户访问权限的差异化编码策略，以及对内容交付路径上未编码数据的重新编码。

Result: 与传统的CCN实现相比，所提出的框架在网络吞吐量、缓存命中率和内容交付延迟方面均有显著改善。

Conclusion: 通过集成去中心化编码缓存（DCC）技术，本文提出的CCN架构改进显著提升了网络吞吐量、缓存命中率，并降低了内容交付延迟。

Abstract: Content-Centric Networking (CCN) offers a novel architectural paradigm that
seeks to address the inherent limitations of the prevailing Internet Protocol
(IP)-based networking model. In contrast to the host-centric communication
approach of IP networks, CCN prioritizes content by enabling direct addressing
and routing based on content identifiers. The potential performance
improvements of CCN can be further amplified through optimized management of
coded data storage and transmission strategies. Decentralized Coded Caching
(DCC) emerges as a promising technique that harnesses the collective caching
power of distributed network elements. By strategically pre-positioning
frequently accessed content closer to potential consumers during periods of low
network utilization, DCC has the potential to mitigate content transfer rates
during peak traffic periods. This paper proposes a series of fundamental
modifications to the CCN architecture by integrating DCC. The proposed
framework incorporates differentiated coding strategies tailored to user access
privileges, thereby eliminating the overhead associated with queue-based
searching. Additionally, the framework facilitates recoding of uncoded data
encountered along the content delivery path. These combined methodologies
demonstrably enhance network throughput, elevate cache hit ratios, and
consequently, reduce content delivery latency compared to conventional CCN
implementations.

Result: 实验表明，M3LLM在任务准确性、通信成本和专家路由适应性方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: M3LLM通过引入模型上下文协议（MCP）和双流SAC算法，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在动态无线网络条件下的任务准确性、通信效率和专家路由适应性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on centralized
architectures and often suffer from poor alignment between the input task and
their fixed visual encoding modules, which limits performance on diverse and
dynamic visual tasks. With the increasing deployment of resource-efficient
models on edge devices in wireless networks, a new opportunity emerges to
dynamically use distributed vision experts for improved MLLM inference quality.
To enable this, we propose M3LLM, where the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
coordinates a mixture of vision experts to achieve distributed MLLMs.
Specifically, MCP is an open protocol that structures the input task context
into interpretable representations, enabling wireless network-aware
coordination between the central model backbone and edge-hosted vision experts.
Based on the MCP representation, M3LLM formulates vision expert routing as a
joint optimization problem that balances task-expert semantic compatibility and
channel performance. To solve the resulting gradient conflicts, we develop a
dual-stream Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with decoupled reward signals and
introduce an Adaptive Stability Enhancement Module (ASEM) based on hierarchical
Bayesian modeling to ensure effective routing. Experiments show that M3LLM
improves task accuracy, reduces communication cost, and enhances expert routing
adaptability under dynamic wireless network conditions.

Motivation: 视频缓存因能显著提升视频流媒体交付效率和质量而成为无线通信流量的主要组成部分。由于缓存空间有限，需设计适应动态用户需求的缓存策略以最大化系统收入。系统收入受视频交付收益及传输和缓存替换成本影响，而缓存内容对未来替换成本的影响使得多时隙需求预测成为高效缓存规划的重要前提。

Abstract: Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance
quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless
communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be
designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system
revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested
videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache
replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the
replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache
placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.
Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution
for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a
Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict
multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely
accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content
popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand
distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results
to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This
latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we
then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results
demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to
that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching
methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper
system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based
optimization approaches.

Conclusion: NetConv通过堆叠交通卷积层和连续字节掩码预训练任务，显著提高了加密流量分类的性能和效率，平均分类性能提升6.88%，模型吞吐量提升7.41倍。

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is vital for modern network management and
security. To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent
methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on
large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two
limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited
model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity;
(2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit
positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during
pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear
complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers
in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a
systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency
and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this
trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for
encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution
layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns
through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a
continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn
protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that
NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model
throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.

Conclusion: PRIME框架通过监控模型参数的有效秩和不活跃神经元的比例，在模型可塑性下降时适当增加参数规模，显著提升了加密流量分类任务中的性能。

Abstract: With the continuous development of network environments and technologies,
ensuring cyber security and governance is increasingly challenging. Network
traffic classification(ETC) can analyzes attributes such as application
categories and malicious intent, supporting network management services like
QoS optimization, intrusion detection, and targeted billing. As the prevalence
of traffic encryption increases, deep learning models are relied upon for
content-agnostic analysis of packet sequences. However, the emergence of new
services and attack variants often leads to incremental tasks for ETC models.
To ensure model effectiveness, incremental learning techniques are essential;
however, recent studies indicate that neural networks experience declining
plasticity as tasks increase. We identified plasticity issues in existing
incremental learning methods across diverse traffic samples and proposed the
PRIME framework. By observing the effective rank of model parameters and the
proportion of inactive neurons, the PRIME architecture can appropriately
increase the parameter scale when the model's plasticity deteriorates.
Experiments show that in multiple encrypted traffic datasets and different
category increment scenarios, the PRIME architecture performs significantly
better than other incremental learning algorithms with minimal increase in
parameter scale.

Conclusion: NetClus通过结合预训练模型与蒸馏增强的聚类加速，有效解决了现有加密流量分类系统在大规模架构和依赖标记数据方面的限制，实现了高达6.2倍的加速，同时分类退化保持在1%以下。

Abstract: Traffic classification plays a significant role in network service
management. The advancement of deep learning has established pretrained models
as a robust approach for this task. However, contemporary encrypted traffic
classification systems face dual limitations. Firstly, pretrained models
typically exhibit large-scale architectures, where their extensive
parameterization results in slow inference speeds and high computational
latency. Secondly, reliance on labeled data for fine-tuning restricts these
models to predefined supervised classes, creating a bottleneck when novel
traffic types emerge in the evolving Internet landscape. To address these
challenges, we propose NetClus, a novel framework integrating pretrained models
with distillation-enhanced clustering acceleration. During fine-tuning, NetClus
first introduces a cluster-friendly loss to jointly reshape the latent space
for both classification and clustering. With the fine-tuned model, it distills
the model into a lightweight Feed-Forward Neural Network model to retain
semantics. During inference, NetClus performs heuristic merge with near-linear
runtime, and valid the cluster purity with newly proposed metrics ASI to
identify emergent traffic types while expediting classification. Benchmarked
against existing pretrained methods, NetClus achieves up to 6.2x acceleration
while maintaining classification degradation below 1%.

Abstract: Future networks, such as 6G, will need to support a vast and diverse range of
interconnected devices and applications, each with its own set of requirements.
While traditional network management approaches will suffice, an automated
solutions are becoming a must. However, network automation frameworks are prone
to errors, and often they employ ML-based techniques that require training to
learn how the network can be optimized. In this sense, network digital twins
are a useful tool that allows for the simulation, testing, and training of AI
models without affecting the real-world networks and users. This paper presents
an AI-based Network Digital Twin (AI-NDT) that leverages a multi-layered
knowledge graph architecture and graph neural networks to predict network
metrics that directly affect the quality of experience of users. An evaluation
of the four most prominent Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures was
conducted to assess their effectiveness in developing network digital twins. We
trained the digital twin on publicly available measurement data from RIPE
Atlas, therefore obtaining results close to what is expected in real-world
applications. The results show that among the four architectures evaluated,
GraphTransformer presents the best performance. However, other architectures
might fit better in scenarios where shorter training time is important, while
also delivering acceptable results. The results of this work are indicative of
what might become common practice for proactive network management, offering a
scalable and accurate solution aligned with the requirements of the
next-generation networks.

*Yongzhe Xu,Weitong Li,Eeshan Umrani,Taejoong Chung*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: ASINT 通过结合多种数据源和 LLM 推理，改进了 ASN 到组织的映射，识别更多跨区域关系，并在安全和测量任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要依赖 WHOIS 或 PeeringDB，无法捕捉重要的关系（如跨区域别名、父子所有权）或统一分散在不同 RIR 标识符中的组织。

Method: ASINT 是一个端到端的流程，结合了批量注册数据和非结构化网络资源，采用检索增强生成（RAG）来引导 LLM 推理，通过多阶段过程将 ASN 合并为“组织家族”。

Result: ASINT 将 111,470 个 ASN 映射到 81,233 个组织家族，相比 AS2ORG+ 和 AS-Sibling，识别出更多跨区域分组，并在安全和测量任务中表现更优（如减少误报和提高准确性）。

Conclusion: ASINT 通过融合多种数据源和利用大型语言模型（LLM）推理，提供了更准确的互联网组织结构视图，支持定期更新，并在安全和测量任务中表现出显著改进。

Abstract: Accurately mapping Autonomous Systems (ASNs) to their owning or operating
organizations underpins Internet measurement research and security
applications. Yet existing approaches commonly rely solely on WHOIS or
PeeringDB, missing important relationships (e.g., cross-regional aliases,
parent-child ownership) and failing to unify organizations scattered across
different RIR identifiers. We introduce ASINT, an end-to-end pipeline that
fuses bulk registry data with unstructured Web sources, then employs
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to guide large language model (LLM)
inference. Through a multi-stage procedure, ASINT merges ASNs into
"organization families," capturing nuanced ties beyond the scope of simpler
heuristics.
  ASINT maps 111,470 ASNs to 81,233 organization families; compared to both
AS2ORG+ and AS-Sibling, ASINT identifies more cross-regional groupings (e.g.,
operator aliases, rebrands) that other datasets overlook. Moreover, our refined
mappings enhance multiple security and measurement tasks: ASINT exposes 27.5%
more intra-organizational RPKI misconfigurations, cuts false-positive hijack
alarms by 9.4%, and lowers erroneous IP leasing inferences by 5.9%.
  Finally, ASINT supports periodic updates and cost-sensitive LLM selection,
demonstrating that broader Web evidence can provide a more accurate, evolving
view of the Internet's organizational structure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨3D图形绘制中边缘交叉及其类似配置对可读性的影响，以改进质量评估和绘图算法。

Method: 通过实证研究，调查了3D图形绘制中边缘交叉感知的影响因素，并比较了不同因素类别之间的差异。

Result: 研究结果表明，3D图形绘制中的边缘交叉感知受深度、边缘距离和相对边缘方向等因素影响，与2D图形绘制中的交叉感知存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究发现，3D图形绘制中的边缘交叉感知受到多种因素的影响，包括深度、边缘距离和相对边缘方向等，这些因素与2D图形绘制中的交叉感知存在显著差异。

Abstract: Human perception of graph drawings is influenced by a variety of impact
factors for which quality measures are used as a proxy indicator. The
investigation of those impact factors and their effects is important to
evaluate and improve quality measures and drawing algorithms. The number of
edge crossings in a 2D graph drawing has long been a main quality measure for
drawing evaluation. The use of stereoscopic 3D graph visualisations has gained
attraction over the last years, and results from several studies indicate that
they can improve analysis efficiency for a range of analysis scenarios. While
edge crossings can also occur in 3D, there are edge configurations in space
that are not crossings but might be perceived as such from a specific
viewpoint. Such configurations create crossings when projected on the
corresponding 2D image plane and could impact readability similar to 2D
crossings. In 3D drawings, the additional depth aspect and the subsequent
impact factors of edge distance and relative edge direction in space might
further influence the importance of those configurations for readability. We
investigate the impact of such factors in an empirical study and report on
findings of difference between major factor categories.

TL;DR: MeshLLM uses LLMs to process 3D meshes via Primitive-Mesh decomposition, achieving better performance and scalability than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing methods, such as dataset scale constraints and loss of 3D structural information during mesh serialization, MeshLLM aims to better align with LLM scaling laws.

Method: The framework introduces a Primitive-Mesh decomposition strategy and employs face connectivity inference and local mesh assembly training to enhance LLMs' ability to handle mesh topology and spatial structures.

Result: MeshLLM creates a dataset 50 times larger than previous methods (1500k+ samples) and outperforms LLaMA-Mesh in experiments.

Conclusion: MeshLLM demonstrates significant potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes, outperforming existing methods like LLaMA-Mesh in both generation quality and shape understanding.

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach
addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset
scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural
information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh
decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful
subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+
samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with
the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face
connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies,
significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial
structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art
LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding,
highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

Motivation: 为了支持逼真的着装人像创建，减少对昂贵多视图捕捉设备和专业3D编辑的依赖。

Method: 首先在共享坐标系中重建和对齐每层服装，然后通过碰撞感知优化处理穿透问题，并利用隐式神经场细化服装边界。

Conclusion: 该方法通过单摄像头和多层服装拍摄，实现了无模板、类别无关的多层3D服装重建，并在实验中展示了与类别特定方法相竞争的性能。

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive
multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the
creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for
reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which
captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB
camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified
3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.
Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate
system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a
collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further
refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth
noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables
the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our
experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D
clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to
category-specific methods. Project page: https://eth-ait.github.io/ReMu/

Motivation: 现有方法在生成批量样本时难以保持动作的多样性，尤其是在复杂的运动动力学下。

Method: MCG-IMM 将预训练生成模型的采样过程重新表述为多标准优化问题，通过优化过程探索满足多样性和平滑性等多项标准的动作序列。

Conclusion: MCG-IMM 是一种无需引入额外参数的即插即用方法，能够有效提升预训练模型生成动作的多样性，并在四个流行的人体运动数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions
that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining
smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse
motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly
when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to
differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with
In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion
generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it
enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without
introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling
process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.
Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained
generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an
optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple
criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play
multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative
models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational
autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular
human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art
methods in in-betweening motion generation task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高斯泼溅中的UE新方法，通过建模训练误差和可见性生成不确定性特征图，实验显示其优于现有技术且具有泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅在机器人学和医学等关键应用中需要可靠的UE，现有方法通常仅估计高斯原始的方差，缺乏对训练视图误差和可见性的直接建模。

Method: 通过建立训练误差和可见性的原始表示，并通过渲染生成不确定性特征图，再通过像素级回归聚合这些特征图。

Result: 实验表明，该方法与真实误差高度相关，尤其在前景物体上表现优异，且回归模型对新场景具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在高斯泼溅（Gaussian Splatting）中实现了高效的UE，尤其在前景物体上表现优于现有技术，且回归模型对新场景具有泛化能力，无需额外数据即可进行UE。

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in
Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical
applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate
the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain
pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of
error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty
information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error
and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained
by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel
views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty
feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout
data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,
investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression
models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into
foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The
trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes,
allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.
