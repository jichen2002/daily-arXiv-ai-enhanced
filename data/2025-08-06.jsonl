Mobile base stations (gNBs) stand as a\npromising solution by physically relocating to restore or sustain LoS, thereby\nnecessitating the development of intelligent algorithms for autonomous movement\ncontrol.\n  As part of the CONVERGE research project, which is developing an experimental\nchamber to integrate computer vision (CV) into mobile networks and enhance\nQuality of Service (QoS) in dynamic wireless environments, this paper presents\ntwo key contributions. First, we introduce the CONVERGE Chamber Simulator\n(CC-SIM), a 3D simulation environment for developing, training, and validating\nmobility control algorithms for mobile gNBs. CC-SIM models user and obstacle\nmobility, visual occlusion, and Radio Frequency (RF) propagation behavior. It\nsupports both offline reinforcement learning and real-time testing through\ntight integration with a standalone 5G system via the OpenAirInterface (OAI) RF\nsimulator, enabling validation under realistic network conditions.\n  Second, leveraging CC-SIM, we develop a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that\nlearns to reposition the gNB proactively in response to dynamic environmental\nchanges. Experiments across three representative use cases show that the\ntrained agent significantly reduces LoS blockage time - by up to 42% - when\ncompared to static deployments. These results highlight the effectiveness of\nlearning-based mobility control in adaptive next-generation wireless networks."}

This reduction employs the notion of de\nBruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$. A single\nEulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini\net al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX\n2020] based on $z$-anonymity.\n  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a\nde Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function\nmaps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in\nthe reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the\nlatter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an\ninterval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the\nfollowing basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we\nefficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et\nal.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.\n  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain\nknowledge in the complexity. Ben-Dor et al. developed an algorithm to solve the\nproblem on de Bruijn graphs in $O(m \\cdot w^{1.5} 4^{w})$ time, where $m=|E|$\nand $w$ is the maximum interval length over all edges.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel\ncoarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level\nannotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their\ninherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order\nto model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By\njointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively\nrefines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,\nachieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based\nmodeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,\nwe demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and\nMSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.\nExperimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art\nweakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach."}

While\npowerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,\nthey not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also\nsteerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and\nprecise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ\noptimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to\nself-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when\nself-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief\nor answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty\nlevels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph\nstructures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,\nOpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\\% in text-based biology\nand medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE).

For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models.

Using scaling laws derived from standard object\nrecognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and\nsystematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different\ndatasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a\ncertain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of\nout-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to\nstill use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they\nmight work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working\nconditions are different."}

Traditional\nnavigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for\ndynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a\nresult, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when\nhandling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language\nmodels and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive\nhazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping\nframework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential\ndynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling\nrobots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this\nlanguage-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only\nidentifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around\npotential hazards arising from environmental dynamics.

To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data\ngeneration pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic\nin-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use\nreasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task\ndomains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.\nThe fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on\nour test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on\nvarious out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong\ngeneralizability to real-world tool-use scenarios."}

However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling\nthem to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while\nleaving other areas unaffected.

To compensate for the\nlack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring\nsource domain images to target style.

UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation\nprocess from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation\noffline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial\nperturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted\non multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results\ndemonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for\ndata-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the\nonline generation of adversarial examples during training.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that\nleverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal\nreasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps\ncontinuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from\nlarge-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,\nencoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of\ndegradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to\ndistribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.\nTherefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to\nsystematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level\nCausal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with\nthe brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a\nFeature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective\nAttention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by\nillumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while\nenhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible\nfeature-level intervention.

We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework\nthat learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled\nrepresentations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training\nsolely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible\ndisentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on\narbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion\nmodels and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51\nstyles $\\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement\nthrough systematic style-content pairing.

However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these\ncapabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has\nattempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative\nmodels, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to\nvideo content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly\nunnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended\ngenerative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and\ninter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying\nimage-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield\nvideo from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint\nframe optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.\nFurthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization\nobjectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce\noutputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to\noptimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and\nsubjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results\nshow that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the\nbaseline methods."}

To\naddress this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive\nguidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps\nbased on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method\nis lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible\nwith standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image\n(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables\nup to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,\nrobustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm\nthe generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and\nhyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance\nadaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative\nmodels."}

To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional\ndiffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism\n(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and\ndepth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal\nAlignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a\nPanoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency\nacross monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two\nmetrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to\nevaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,\nSemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila\nachieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,\nwhile enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR\nsemantic segmentation."}

Unlearnable Examples\n(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model\ntraining, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning\nof meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically\ngenerate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their\nassociated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is\noften computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on\nexternal third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:\nusers must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve\nprotection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction\nhas severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection\nsolutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \\textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable\nExample (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using\nonly text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by\nemploying a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image\n(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce\neffective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected\ndata substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal\nretrieval) for state-of-the-art models.

The long denoising sequence for each action prediction\nimpedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require\nmillions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical\nfine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion\npolicies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong\ndependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for\nfine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement\nlearning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment\ninteractions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective\nadaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline\nplay interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,\nmaking the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot\nlearning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across\neight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude\nfewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this\nis the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world\nrobotic skills using an offline world model.
