*Zongyou Yang,Jonathan Loo*

Main category: cs.CV

Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these
advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf
network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1)
Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on
self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

TL;DR: DreamVVT是一个基于DiTs的两阶段框架，通过多帧试穿和视频生成模型解决视频虚拟试穿中的细节保留和时序一致性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端方法依赖稀缺配对数据且未能充分利用预训练模型和测试输入，导致细节保留和时序一致性不足。

Method: 基于Diffusion Transformers的两阶段框架：第一阶段利用多帧试穿模型和视觉语言模型合成高质量关键帧；第二阶段结合骨架图和动态描述，通过增强的视频生成模型实现长期时序一致性。

Result: 实验表明，DreamVVT在保留服装细节和时序稳定性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamVVT通过两阶段框架有效解决了现有视频虚拟试穿技术在保留细节和时序一致性方面的挑战，并在真实场景中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [4] [Learning Latent Representations for Image Translation using Frequency Distributed CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03415)
*Shivangi Nigam,Adarsh Prasad Behera,Shekhar Verma,P. Nagabhushan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN通过频率感知和局部邻域编码改进CycleGAN，提升图像转换的视觉一致性和语义准确性，适用于多种应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升潜在表示学习以逼近真实数据分布，解决图像转换任务中局部像素语义和结构一致性的问题。

Method: 基于CycleGAN框架，引入局部邻域编码（LNE）和频率感知监督，结合KL/JS散度和基于对数的相似性度量来量化生成图像与真实图像分布的匹配程度。

Result: 在Horse2Zebra、Monet2Photo和Strike-off数据集上，Fd-CycleGAN表现出更优的感知质量、更快的收敛速度和更高的模式多样性，尤其在低数据量情况下。

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN通过整合局部邻域编码和频率感知监督，显著提升了图像转换任务的泛化能力，适用于文档修复、艺术风格转换和医学图像合成等领域。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

### [5] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出用DynTanh替代特征层归一化，解决了IJEPA中因归一化导致的能量层级破坏问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征归一化破坏了视觉标记的自然能量层级，导致语义重要区域的优先级丧失，并产生棋盘状伪影。

Method: 提出用DynTanh激活替换特征层归一化（LN），以更好地保留标记能量并允许高能量标记对预测损失有更大贡献。

Result: 使用DynTanh激活的IJEPA模型表现出更长尾的损失分布，修复了损失图中的棋盘状伪影，ImageNet线性探测准确率从38%提升至42.7%，NYU Depth V2单目深度估计的RMSE降低了0.08。

Conclusion: 保留视觉标记的自然能量层级对于有效的自监督视觉表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [6] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE是一种混合模型，结合NeRF的高质量渲染和GS的可编辑性，实现实时编辑与动态交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在高质量渲染方面表现出色，但难以编辑；GS易于编辑但渲染质量较低。GENIE旨在结合两者的优势，实现高质量渲染与直观编辑的平衡。

Method: GENIE采用了一种混合模型，结合了NeRF和GS的优势。通过为每个高斯分配可训练的特征嵌入，并利用RT-GPS进行高效最近高斯搜索，结合多分辨率哈希网格更新高斯特征。

Result: GENIE支持实时、局部感知的编辑，高斯基元的修改可立即反映在渲染输出中，同时兼容物理模拟。

Conclusion: GENIE通过结合NeRF的高质量渲染和GS的可编辑性，提供了一种实时、直观的场景编辑和动态交互方法，填补了几何编辑与神经渲染之间的空白。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code
can be found under (https://github.com/MikolajZielinski/genie)

*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于粗标注的从粗到细分割框架，通过转移矩阵建模不准确区域，联合训练逐步逼近精确标注，实验性能优于弱监督方法，接近全监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量像素级标注在医学图像分割中至关重要，但获取成本高且需要专业知识，因此需要一种仅依赖粗标注的有效方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的从粗到细的分割框架，利用粗标注（包括目标和互补绘图）并通过转移矩阵建模不准确和不完整区域，通过联合训练逐步细化网络输出。

Result: 在两个公共心脏成像数据集（ACDC和MSCMRseg）上验证了方法的灵活性和有效性，并在UK Biobank数据集上进一步评估，结果显示其优于现有弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的从粗到细的分割框架通过引入转移矩阵和联合训练多组粗标注，有效逼近了精确标注的分割分布，实验结果表明其性能优于现有弱监督方法，接近全监督方法的水平。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [8] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAR是一种模拟真实LiDAR检测的模型，填补了微观交通模拟器的感知建模空白，通过GRU-enhanced APPNP架构在nuScenes数据集上达到0.909 AUC，验证了其在合作感知交通应用中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实自动驾驶车辆部署的不切实际性，模拟成为主要研究方法。但现有模拟器在扩展性和感知建模能力上存在不足，MIDAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MIDAR利用车辆级特征构建Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS)图来编码车辆间的遮挡关系，并采用GRU-enhanced APPNP架构进行特征传播，以预测真实LiDAR检测结果中的真阳性和假阴性。

Result: MIDAR在nuScenes AD数据集上达到了0.909的AUC，成功模拟了主流3D LiDAR检测模型CenterPoint的检测结果，并在两种基于合作感知的交通应用中验证了其必要性。

Conclusion: MIDAR成功填补了微观交通模拟器在感知建模能力上的不足，通过模拟真实的LiDAR检测结果，为基于合作感知的交通应用提供了可行的解决方案，并展示了其在多种应用场景中的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

*J. Alex Hurt,Trevor M. Bajkowski,Grant J. Scott,Curt H. Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based models outperform CNNs in object detection on satellite imagery, as shown by extensive comparisons across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of transformer-based models in CV, there's a need to assess their performance on satellite imagery, especially compared to established DCNNs.

Method: The study compares eleven bounding-box detection and localization algorithms, including five transformer-based architectures and six convolutional networks, across three open-source high-resolution remote sensing datasets. Thirty-three deep neural models were trained and evaluated.

Result: Transformer-based architectures show superior performance over convolutional networks in object detection tasks for satellite imagery.

Conclusion: Transformer-based neural networks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in object detection for high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, surpassing traditional convolutional networks.

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft enhances LVLMs' creative text generation by integrating structured visual extraction and dynamic prompting, achieving superior performance in creativity and instruction adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and precise adherence to nuanced user instructions in long-form text generation.

Method: VisuCraft integrates a multimodal structured information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G) to distill fine-grained visual attributes and generate optimized prompts for LVLMs.

Result: VisuCraft outperforms baseline LVLMs on the ImageStoryGen-500K dataset, showing remarkable improvements in creativity and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: VisuCraft significantly enhances LVLMs' capabilities in generating imaginative, visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text, unlocking new potential for sophisticated creative AI applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

Motivation: 扩散模型在无监督异常分割中表现出色，但通常依赖正常数据进行训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决仅含污染数据时的模型鲁棒性问题。

Method: 通过将数据的最大似然估计转化为非线性回归问题，从回归角度重新解释去噪扩散概率模型，并利用鲁棒回归推导出鲁棒版本的扩散模型。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上，该方法比现有扩散模型性能提升显著（AUROC提高8.08%，AUPRC提高10.37%）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新型的鲁棒去噪扩散模型，适用于仅含污染（即正常与异常混合）未标记数据的情况。实验表明，该方法在仅含污染数据时，优于当前最先进的扩散模型，性能提升显著。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种材料控制的声学特征生成方法，通过编码器-解码器模型生成高保真RIR，效果优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过用户定义的材质配置在推理时生成目标声学特性，解决材料控制的声学特征生成任务。

Result: 模型能够基于动态定义的多种材料配置生成多样化的RIR，并在新基准数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该模型能有效编码材料信息并生成高保真度的房间脉冲响应，优于多种基线方法和现有技术。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

*Vebjørn Haug Kåsene,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现现成的LVLMs能执行VLN任务，但性能不及专门设计的模型，且支持低级和全景动作空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现成的LVLMs（未经架构修改或模拟器训练）是否能有效支持VLN任务，以及是否同时支持低级和全景动作范式。

Method: 在Room-to-Room（R2R）数据集上对开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct进行微调，并评估其在低级和全景动作空间中的表现。

Result: 最佳模型在R2R测试集上实现了41%的成功率。

Conclusion: 现成的大型视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）虽然可以学习执行视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务，但在性能上仍落后于专门为此任务设计的模型。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAP估计在盲去模糊中倾向于产生模糊解，限制了其有效性。本文旨在通过扩散先验重新审视这一问题。

Method: 通过经验性检查基于扩散先验的似然景观，并对其关键特性进行分析，结合理论分析盲去模糊后验。

Result: MAP估计倾向于产生接近Dirac delta函数的锐利滤波器和模糊解，而后验的局部最小值对应真实的自然图像，有效解决了盲去卷积问题。

Conclusion: 研究发现，克服MAP估计的限制需要良好的局部初始化以找到后验景观中的局部最小值，这为设计改进的先验和优化技术提供了实际指导。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

TL;DR: 研究发现，ImageNet预训练对超小型模型（<1M参数）的鲁棒性仍有帮助，但效果随模型减小而减弱，建议避免使用过小模型以保证不同工作条件下的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在嵌入式设备上运行的超小型模型（参数少于100万）中，ImageNet预训练对下游任务鲁棒性的影响，以解决现实应用中模型需同时具备鲁棒性和轻量化的需求。

Method: 通过从标准物体识别架构中衍生的缩放定律，构建了两个超小型骨干网络家族，并系统研究了它们在红外视觉模态下游物体检测任务中的性能。

Result: 实验表明，ImageNet预训练在超小型模型中仍有一定作用，但随着模型容量减小，其对分布外检测鲁棒性的提升效果会逐渐减弱。

Conclusion: 尽管ImageNet预训练对超小型模型仍有益处，但当模型容量低于某一阈值时，其对于分布外检测鲁棒性的提升效果会逐渐减弱。因此，建议实践者在可能的情况下避免使用过小的模型，因为它们虽然在域内问题上表现良好，但在不同工作条件下可能表现脆弱。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

TL;DR: X-Actor 是一种音频驱动肖像动画框架，通过两阶段解耦生成流程实现长范围情感丰富的表演，超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要集中在受限说话场景下的唇部同步和短范围视觉保真度，而缺乏对情感表达和长范围表演的捕捉。X-Actor 旨在实现演员级别的长范围肖像表演，捕捉与语音节奏和内容连贯的动态演变情感。

Method: X-Actor 采用两阶段解耦生成流程：首先，音频条件自回归扩散模型预测身份无关的面部运动潜在标记；其次，基于扩散的视频合成模块将这些运动转化为高保真视频动画。通过扩散强制训练范式，模型在紧凑的面部运动潜在空间中有效捕捉音频与面部动态的长期相关性。

Result: 实验表明，X-Actor 能够生成超越标准说话头部动画的引人入胜的电影风格表演，并在长范围音频驱动情感肖像表演中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: X-Actor 是一种创新的音频驱动肖像动画框架，能够从单一参考图像和输入音频片段生成逼真、情感丰富的说话头部视频。通过两阶段解耦生成流程，该方法在长时序上下文中捕捉音频与面部动态的长期关联，实现了无错误积累的无限长度情感丰富运动预测，并在长范围音频驱动情感肖像表演中达到了最先进的效果。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

TL;DR: 论文提出基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架（含HNM和IGM），显著提升空间异构噪声下的去噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪模型在空间异构噪声（OOD条件）下泛化能力不足，尺度等变性被视为提升鲁棒性的核心归纳偏置。

Method: 提出了一种结合尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，包含HNM（稳定特征分布并动态校正）和IGM（通过门控交互调节信息流）。

Result: 模型在合成和真实世界基准测试中均表现优异，尤其在空间异构噪声条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，通过HNM和IGM模块显著提升了模型在空间异构噪声条件下的鲁棒性和性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成多样性和高保真图像方面表现出色，但在提示遵从性和质量上存在显著差异。负提示虽能改善提示遵从性，但显式负面提示存在信息丢失和不完整的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为ANSWER的训练自由采样技术，适用于任何支持无分类器引导（CFG）的模型，通过结合正负条件来优化图像生成。

Result: ANSWER在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，人类偏好度是其他方法的两倍。

Conclusion: ANSWER方法通过利用扩散模型对否定的内部理解，无需显式负面提示即可提高图像生成的忠实度，且在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法，并更受人类偏好。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗扰动方法在攻击基于Transformer的目标检测器时表现较弱，AFOG旨在设计一种神经架构无关的统一对抗注意力框架，以有效攻击不同类型的检测器。

Method: AFOG利用可学习的注意力机制，将扰动集中在多框检测任务中的脆弱图像区域，并通过集成两种特征损失和迭代注入对抗扰动来优化攻击损失。

Result: AFOG在COCO数据集上的12个大型检测Transformer上进行了广泛实验，结果显示其性能优于现有攻击方法，最高提升83%，并具有更高的速度和不可察觉性。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种高效且隐蔽的对抗扰动方法，通过战略性生成视觉上难以察觉的扰动，能够有效攻击基于Transformer和CNN的目标检测器，并在实验中表现优于现有攻击方法。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有检测方法主要集中在生成前过滤提示或生成后审核图像，而扩散模型的生成阶段NSFW检测研究较少。

Method: 提出In-Generation Detection (IGD)方法，利用扩散过程中的预测噪声作为内部信号进行NSFW内容检测。

Result: 在七个NSFW类别上的实验显示，IGD平均检测准确率达91.32%，优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD方法通过利用扩散过程中的预测噪声作为内部信号，有效识别NSFW内容，实验证明其在对抗性提示下仍保持高准确率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

Conclusion: MGFC框架通过分层和粒度感知的校准，有效将视觉基础模型的泛化优势转移到领域广义语义分割任务中，实验证明其在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

Method: 提出了一种名为SLFG的新方法，通过将单个帧组合成语义连贯的场景帧，利用场景定位方法和动态帧重组机制，显著提升了MLLMs在长视频中的理解能力。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at

Conclusion: SA-3DGS 提出了一种有效的方法，通过重要性评分和聚类模块显著减少了存储成本，同时保持了渲染质量，并在多个基准数据集上验证了其性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face

Conclusion: VideoForest 通过基于人物特征的层次化推理，为跨视频理解建立了新范式，显著提升了跨视频推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed

applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

*Hyebin Cho,Jaehyup Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceMat 是一种无需辅助输入的实时面部遮罩框架，通过两阶段训练和不确定性感知，显著提升了遮挡情况下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部滤镜在遮挡情况下性能下降，需解决遮挡物与面部分离的精细遮罩问题。

Method: FaceMat 采用两阶段训练流程：教师模型通过负对数似然损失联合预测 alpha 遮罩和逐像素不确定性，学生模型则通过空间自适应知识蒸馏利用不确定性指导学习。

Result: FaceMat 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，提升了真实视频场景下的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FaceMat 提出了一种无需辅助输入的实时面部遮罩方法，通过两阶段训练和不确定性感知策略，显著提升了在复杂遮挡情况下的性能，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

*Lekang Wen,Jing Xiao,Liang Liao,Jiajun Chen,Mi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHARM提出互补学习框架，通过MPU和双路径优化策略实现跨模态和谐协同，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过显式特征对齐实现模态同质化，削弱了各模态的独特优势与互补性。CHARM旨在通过互补学习框架实现协同和谐化。

Method: CHARM框架包含两个核心组件：Mutual Perception Unit (MPU) 通过窗口式跨模态交互实现隐式对齐；双路径优化策略（CoL和InE）分别负责互补融合学习和模态特异性优化。

Result: 在多数据集和骨干网络上的实验表明，CHARM始终优于基线方法，尤其在脆弱模态上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: CHARM框架通过互补学习策略，实现了跨模态的和谐协同而非同质化，显著提升了脆弱模态的性能，为多样性中的真正和谐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

TL;DR: SSFMamba是一种基于Mamba的双分支网络，通过融合空间和频率域特征提升3D医学图像分割性能，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在频率域特征提取中忽视了其独特属性（如共轭对称性）和与空间域的数据分布差异，导致频率域表示的互补优势未能充分发挥。

Method: 提出SSFMamba网络，采用双分支架构分别提取空间和频率域特征，并利用Mamba块进行异构特征融合，同时设计了3D多方向扫描机制以增强局部与全局线索的融合。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上的实验表明，SSFMamba在多种评估指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSFMamba通过结合空间和频率域的双分支架构，利用Mamba块融合异构特征，有效提升了3D医学图像分割的性能，证明了其在全局上下文建模和局部细节保留方面的优势。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: RobustGS通过退化学习和语义感知增强，提升前馈3DGS在恶劣成像条件下的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈式3DGS方法假设输入多视图图像干净且高质量，但实际场景中图像常受噪声、低光或雨等恶劣条件影响，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出了一种通用的多视图特征增强模块RobustGS，包含通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，前者提取退化表征，后者增强特征空间中的语义聚合。

Result: 实验表明，RobustGS以即插即用方式集成到现有方法中，在多种退化条件下均实现最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: RobustGS模块通过引入通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，显著提升了3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在多种恶劣成像条件下的重建质量，且无需对现有预训练流程进行额外优化。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注种族和性别等人口属性，而更广泛的属性公平性尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建一个开放集的偏见属性知识库，并评估LVLMs在细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: 实验结果表明，LVLMs在多样属性上表现出偏见输出，且文化、环境和行为因素对决策影响更大。

Conclusion: LVLMs在更广泛的属性上表现出偏见，且文化、环境和行为因素对决策的影响比传统人口属性更为显著。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$通过伪袋增强和对比学习框架，显著提升了WSI分类的性能，并在多个评估指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖简单的类名模板，忽略了更丰富的语义信息，限制了持续学习在动态演化的临床环境中的适应性。

Method: 动态构建视觉概念池并通过相似性过滤机制避免冗余，采用跨模态图像-概念注意力模块及注意力损失整合概念到持续学习过程中。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过利用LLM生成的视觉概念作为判别性语义指导，结合跨模态图像-概念注意力模块，显著提升了持续学习的性能，在医学和自然图像数据集上达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如GRPO）存在数据效率低、优势消失问题以及信用分配不均的局限性，AVATAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: AVATAR框架通过两个核心组件实现改进：1. 离策略训练架构，提升样本效率并解决优势消失问题；2. 时序优势塑造（TAS），一种新的信用分配策略，强调关键推理阶段。

Result: AVATAR在多个基准测试中表现优异，如MMVU（+5.4）、OmniBench（+4.9）和Video-Holmes（+4.5），样本效率提升35%以上。

Conclusion: AVATAR框架通过其离策略训练架构和时序优势塑造策略，显著提升了多模态长视频推理的性能和样本效率，优于现有基准。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

TL;DR: CCA通过ICA解耦CLIP视觉特征并增强跨模态对齐，显著提升少样本学习性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习方法依赖隐式解耦表示，导致模型在有限监督下难以有效适应。CLIP等对比学习方法理论上能解耦潜在表示，但可能破坏模态对齐。

Method: 提出Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA)框架，利用无监督独立成分分析(ICA)解耦CLIP视觉特征，并通过单向（文本分类器微调）和双向（跨注意力机制）增强跨模态对齐。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上的实验表明，CCA在少样本性能和分布偏移鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，且保持计算效率。

Conclusion: Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA) 通过显式解耦CLIP视觉特征并增强跨模态对齐，显著提升了少样本学习性能，同时在计算效率和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有的3D重建方法在几何精度和鲁棒性之间存在根本性权衡，H3R旨在通过混合框架解决这一问题。

Method: H3R框架由两部分组成：一个通过极线约束增强几何一致性的高效潜在体积，以及一个利用Plücker坐标进行自适应对应关系细化的相机感知Transformer。

Conclusion: H3R框架通过结合体积潜在融合和基于注意力的特征聚合，有效解决了3D重建中的通用性问题，显著提升了性能并加快了收敛速度。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机的指数级增长，远距离检测成为确保安全操作的关键需求，尤其是在人口密集区域。尽管深度学习在计算机视觉领域取得了巨大进展，但小型空中物体的检测仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入了LRDDv2数据集，包含39,516张经过精细标注的图像，其中8,000多张包含目标距离信息，专为远距离空中物体检测设计。

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

TL;DR: OmniShape是一种新方法，通过分解形状补全为两个多模态分布并训练条件扩散模型，实现了从单次观测中概率估计物体的姿态和完整形状，在真实数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单次观测中估计物体的姿态和完整形状，而不假设已知的3D模型或类别，是一个具有挑战性的问题。OmniShape旨在通过概率姿态和形状估计来解决这一问题。

Method: OmniShape通过将形状补充分解为两个多模态分布：一个捕获测量如何投影到由数据集定义的归一化物体参考框架中，另一个建模以三平面神经场表示的物体几何先验。通过为这两个分布训练单独的条件扩散模型，实现了从联合姿态和形状分布中采样多个假设。

Result: OmniShape在具有挑战性的真实世界数据集上表现出色，能够从单次观测中估计物体的姿态和完整形状。

Conclusion: OmniShape展示了在具有挑战性的真实世界数据集上的出色表现，证明了其能够从单次观测中估计物体的姿态和完整形状的潜力。

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose
and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape
completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: Veila提出的条件扩散框架通过CACM、GCMA和PFC机制，成功解决了RGB图像与全景LiDAR数据生成中的三大挑战，实现了高保真度和跨模态一致性的生成，并在下游任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: UniEdit-I是一种无需训练的统一视觉语言模型图像编辑框架，通过理解、编辑和验证三个迭代步骤实现高效编辑，性能达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管OpenAI的GPT-4o提出的生成管道（理解VLM→视觉特征→投影器→扩散模型→图像）在统一视觉语言模型（VLM）的未来发展中显示出巨大潜力，但如何轻松实现图像编辑能力仍未被探索。

Method: UniEdit-I通过三个迭代步骤实现图像编辑：1. 理解步骤通过结构化语义分析生成源提示，并根据编辑指令形成目标提示；2. 编辑步骤引入时间自适应偏移，实现从粗到细的连贯编辑；3. 验证步骤检查目标提示与中间编辑图像的对齐情况，提供一致性评分和纠正反馈，决定是否提前停止或继续编辑循环。

Result: 在基于BLIP3-o的实现中，UniEdit-I在GEdit-Bench基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的UniEdit-I框架通过理解、编辑和验证三个迭代步骤，以无需训练的方式实现了统一视觉语言模型的图像编辑能力，并在GEdit-Bench基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

Motivation: 识别并解决基于反转流的图像编辑方法中存在的结构性缺陷，即语义偏见问题，特别是在源和目标语义不相似时。

Method: LORE是一种无需训练的高效图像编辑方法，直接优化反转噪声。

Conclusion: LORE通过直接优化反转噪声，解决了现有方法在泛化性和可控性上的核心限制，实现了稳定、可控且通用的概念替换，无需架构修改或模型微调。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

Conclusion: ChartCap数据集通过其高质量标注和创新的验证流程，显著提升了图表描述生成的准确性和信息量，减少了幻觉内容，超越了现有开源、专有模型及人工标注的效果。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

Motivation: 尽管大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在理解复杂视觉文本上下文方面取得了突破，但幻觉问题限制了其实际应用。现有方法主要针对摄影图像，忽视了风格化图像可能带来的风险。

Method: 构建了一个包含摄影图像及其风格化版本的数据集，并标注了标题标签。通过基准测试13种先进的LVLMs，提出了Style-Aware Visual Early Revision (SAVER)机制，利用早期层反馈动态调整模型输出。

Conclusion: SAVER机制通过动态调整LVLMs的输出，显著减少了由风格化图像引起的幻觉问题，并在多种模型、数据集和任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Conclusion: Duplex-GS 框架通过整合代理高斯表示与顺序无关渲染技术，显著提升了渲染质量与效率，同时减少了排序开销，实现了高质量实时渲染。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D

produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展要求检测器持续适应新方法，但现有检测器在学习新类型时对旧类型的性能会急剧下降（灾难性遗忘）。KANs因其局部可塑性适合解决这一问题，但存在高维图像建模无效和输入空间重叠的局限性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的KAN-CFD框架通过DG-KD和FS-KDCP策略，有效解决了KANs在持续学习中的局限性，显著减少了遗忘现象，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

TL;DR: 本文构建了首个公开的 CNV 数据集（CNVSeg），并提出了一种新的图卷积交互增强分割网络（MTG-Net），显著提升了 CNV 分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于 CNV 形状不规则、成像限制（如投影伪影、噪声和边界模糊）以及缺乏公开数据集，现有的 CNV 分割方法面临挑战。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MTG-Net 是一个多任务框架，包含两个基于图的跨任务模块（MIGR 和 MRGR），通过图机制迭代推理任务间的高阶关系，并采用不确定性加权损失来减少伪影和噪声的影响。

Result: MTG-Net 在区域分割和血管分割上分别达到了 87.21% 和 88.12% 的 Dice 分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTG-Net 通过结合区域和血管形态信息，并利用图域中的语义和几何双重约束，显著提升了 CNV 分割的准确性，为湿性 AMD 的临床评估提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Conclusion: AlignCAT在弱监督视觉定位任务中表现出色，通过粗粒度对齐和细粒度对齐模块有效解决了文本表达中的语义模糊问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

*Ting Lei,Shaofeng Yin,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INP-CC improves HOI detection by using interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration, outperforming existing methods on key datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for HOI detection rely on Vision and Language Models but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders and ineffective textual description encoding, limiting the model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships.

Method: The paper proposes INP-CC, an end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration. It includes an interaction-aware prompt generator and language model-guided calibration for refining HOI concept representations.

Result: Extensive experimental results show that INP-CC outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in open-vocabulary HOI detection.

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗扰动方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下表现不佳，且可能引入无关语义内容，无法有效应对VLMs对地理位置的推断威胁。

Method: GeoShield 包含三个关键模块：特征解耦模块、暴露元素识别模块和尺度自适应增强模块，通过联合优化全局和局部扰动来实现高效的隐私保护。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中，GeoShield 在黑盒设置下显著优于现有方法，实现了强隐私保护且对视觉或语义质量影响最小。

Conclusion: GeoShield 提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案，用于抵御高级视觉语言模型（VLMs）对地理位置推断的威胁，显著提升了地理隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

TL;DR: FastInit是一种快速噪声初始化方法，通过单次前向传播优化噪声，显著提升视频生成效率和时间一致性，无需迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FreeInit）通过迭代优化初始噪声来提高时间一致性，但计算成本高，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: FastInit通过训练一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），在单次前向传播中生成优化的噪声，避免了迭代优化过程。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit在不同文本到视频模型中均能提升生成视频的质量和时间一致性。

Conclusion: FastInit提出了一种快速的噪声初始化方法，显著提高了视频生成的效率并保持了时间一致性，为视频生成领域提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验验证了UAA的有效性，证明了其在数据增强对抗防御策略中的新SOTA表现。

Conclusion: UAA框架为构建鲁棒模型提供了一种实用且高效的途径，无需在训练过程中在线生成对抗样本，从而在数据增强对抗防御策略中建立了新的SOTA。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

TL;DR: GIT enhances 3D segmentation by correcting 2D inconsistencies and refining Gaussians, leading to cleaner 3D assets and improved segmentation boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian Splatting often produce inconsistent masks and noisy boundaries due to neglected semantic cues.

Method: The method introduces GIT, augmenting Gaussian representation with an instance weight matrix to correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies, and a GIT-guided adaptive density control mechanism to refine ambiguous Gaussians.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that GIT improves 3D segmentation in both online and offline settings, supporting applications like hierarchical segmentation and scene editing.

Conclusion: Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT) effectively addresses 2D mask inconsistencies and noisy segmentation boundaries in Gaussian Splatting, enabling cleaner 3D asset extraction and improved 3D segmentation across various applications.

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup填补了高质量裸妆配对数据集的空白，为未来美容相关任务的研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写文本生成方法主要关注孤立单词，而真实手写文本需要同时考虑单词间关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距）。生成整个文本行是更全面且有挑战性的任务。

Method: DiffBrush 是一种基于扩散的模型，采用内容解耦风格学习（通过列和行掩码）和多尺度内容学习（使用行和词鉴别器）来生成手写文本行。

Result: 大量实验表明，DiffBrush 在生成高质量文本行方面表现优异，尤其在风格模仿和内容准确性上。

Conclusion: DiffBrush 通过内容解耦风格学习和多尺度内容学习，成功生成了高质量的手写文本行，尤其在风格再现和内容保留方面表现出色。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

Method: 构建了一个统一的提示池空间，通过注意力机制融合动词和名词的细粒度模式表示，并引入了多样化的训练目标（Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization和Prompt Knowledge Orthogonalization）。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens和EGTEA数据集上的实验表明，EgoPrompt在数据集内、跨数据集和基到新泛化基准上均达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: EgoPrompt框架通过统一的提示池空间和多样化的训练目标，有效提升了第一人称动作识别的性能，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Motivation: 解决语义分割模型在训练和测试数据分布偏移时的局限性，特别是在零样本领域自适应语义分割任务中，缺乏目标领域训练数据的问题。

Method: 提出SDGPA方法，通过合成数据生成和渐进式适应策略，利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型生成目标风格图像，并通过裁剪和编辑小区域提高空间精度，同时构建中间域以缩小领域差距。

Result: SDGPA在零样本语义分割任务中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SDGPA方法在零样本语义分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Motivation: 由于传感器测量稀疏性和缺乏捕捉不平坦地形上人体运动的数据集，现有方法在姿态估计精度上表现不佳且仅限于平坦地形。

Method: BaroPoser利用智能手机和智能手表记录的IMU及气压计数据，通过气压读数估计传感器高度变化，并结合局部大腿坐标系解耦局部和全局运动输入。

Result: 在公共基准数据集和真实世界记录上的评估显示，BaroPoser在相同硬件配置下优于仅使用IMU的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: BaroPoser通过结合IMU和气压计数据，显著提高了在不平坦地形上的人体姿态估计和全局平移的准确性，超越了现有仅使用IMU的SOTA方法。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring

continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

Method: 采用双阶段方法：第一阶段通过残差傅里叶引导模块（RFGM）在频域恢复全局光照；第二阶段使用Mamba模块进行纹理结构细化，包括Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba。

Conclusion: 论文提出的双阶段方法在极暗图像中显著提升了细节恢复性能，同时保持了高效性。模块轻量且易于集成到现有傅里叶框架中。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频问答中因处理大量视频帧的高令牌成本而受限，且过多帧会导致性能下降。现有关键帧选择方法仍存在时间冗余问题。

Method: AFP采用自适应层次聚类算法在ResNet-50和CLIP融合特征空间上识别并合并视觉冗余（'visual echoes'），并引入轻量级文本语义图以补充信息。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME基准测试中，AFP将所需帧数减少86.9%，输入令牌减少83.2%，且准确性优于基线。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为自适应帧剪枝（AFP）的新方法，通过智能剪枝关键帧来解决视频问答（Video-QA）中的高令牌成本和上下文稀释问题。实验证明，AFP能显著减少帧数和令牌数量，同时提升准确性。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: CIVQLLIE框架结合离散表示学习和因果干预，解决了夜间图像增强中数据驱动与物理方法的局限性，提升了极端暗光下的增强效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像的低可见性限制了内容感知，现有方法（如数据驱动的端到端映射网络或基于物理的方法）在极端暗光或复杂场景下表现不佳，需一种更可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 利用向量量化（VQ）将连续图像特征映射到离散的视觉标记代码本，并通过多级因果干预（包括像素级PCI模块和特征级FCI机制）校正分布偏移，最后通过高频细节重建模块（HDRM）恢复细节。

Result: CIVQLLIE通过离散代码本和多级因果干预，显著提升了低光图像增强的鲁棒性和细节恢复能力。

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE框架通过离散表示学习和因果干预，有效解决了夜间图像增强中数据驱动方法与物理方法各自的局限性，显著提升了极端暗光条件下的图像增强效果。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

TL;DR: WaMo通过小波变换和多分辨率特征提取，显著提升了文本与3D运动序列的语义对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在匹配3D运动与文本时忽视了人体结构的复杂性和时空动态性，导致语义对齐不精确。WaMo旨在解决这一问题。

Method: WaMo框架包含三个关键组件：轨迹小波分解、轨迹小波重构和乱序运动序列预测，通过多分辨率特征提取和时空信息保留实现精细对齐。

Result: WaMo在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别实现了17.0%和18.2%的Rsum提升，优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: WaMo框架通过小波变换和多分辨率特征提取，显著提升了文本与3D运动序列的语义对齐效果，实验证明其在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别实现了17.0%和18.2%的Rsum提升。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: VLMQ是一种针对视觉语言模型的重要性感知PTQ框架，通过优化Hessian矩阵和轻量级反向传播，显著提升低比特量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）中存在模态差异（文本令牌有限vs.视觉令牌冗余），现有基于Hessian的LLM PTQ方法未考虑令牌重要性，导致性能下降。

Method: VLMQ提出了一种重要性感知的PTQ框架，通过优化包含令牌级重要性因子的Hessian矩阵，并利用轻量级块级反向传播计算这些因子，实现了高效且有效的量化。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，VLMQ在0.5B∼32B VLMs上表现出最先进的性能，尤其在低比特设置下，如2位量化下MME-RealWorld任务提升16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ框架通过重要性感知的PTQ方法，显著提升了视觉语言模型在低比特量化下的性能，尤其在2位量化下实现了16.45%的改进。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

TL;DR: FedPromo 是一种高效联邦学习框架，通过轻量级代理模型和两阶段知识蒸馏，降低计算开销并保持隐私，实验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统联邦学习在大型模型上计算资源需求高的问题，同时保持隐私和效率。

Method: FedPromo 采用两阶段方法：首先在服务器端进行知识蒸馏，将大型基础模型（如 Transformer）与紧凑模型（如 CNN）的表征对齐；然后在客户端设备上部署紧凑模型编码器，本地学习可训练分类器，最后聚合并转移回基础模型。

Result: 在五个图像分类基准测试中，FedPromo 在资源有限的客户端上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedPromo 框架通过轻量级代理模型优化和两阶段知识蒸馏，在保持隐私的同时显著降低了计算开销，并通过实验验证了其在多域学习中的优越性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Motivation: 现有的AiOIR方法要么重新训练扩散模型，要么需要额外的条件指导微调预训练模型，导致高推理成本和有限的降解类型适应性。

Method: 论文提出了一种高效的AiOIR方法DOD，通过多降解特征调制和参数高效的条件下低秩适应，只需一步采样即可实现优异的修复性能。此外，SD解码器中集成了高保真细节增强模块以改善结构和纹理细节。

Result: DOD方法在视觉质量和推理效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 实验证明，DOD方法在视觉质量和推理效率上均优于现有的基于扩散模型的修复方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: GRASP通过伪标签和特征对齐整合解剖学知识，提升病理分割性能，无需重新训练解剖模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法多依赖纯模式识别，忽略了病理发展的解剖学背景，GRASP旨在填补这一空白。

Method: GRASP是一个模块化的即插即用框架，通过伪标签整合和特征对齐，利用现有的解剖学分割模型增强病理分割模型。

Result: 在多个PET/CT数据集上，GRASP在多种评估指标和不同架构中均表现优异，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: GRASP框架通过伪标签整合和特征对齐，有效结合了解剖学上下文信息，显著提升了病理分割模型的性能，且无需重新训练解剖学组件。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于样式与内容在语义上的重叠和人类感知的主观性，显式解耦具有挑战性。现有方法仍面临解耦固有模糊性的问题。

Method: 提出了SCFlow，一个基于流匹配的框架，学习样式与内容之间的双向映射，通过三个关键见解实现：1）仅训练合并任务；2）流匹配避免高斯先验限制；3）使用合成数据集模拟解耦。

Result: SCFlow在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt的零样本设置中表现优异，验证了解耦可从可逆合并过程中自然涌现。

Conclusion: SCFlow通过可逆的样式与内容合并过程，自然地实现了分离，且在零样本设置下泛化性能优异，证明了无需显式监督即可实现解耦。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有步态识别方法在遇到新数据集时需重新训练，且难以保留先前数据集的知识，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出了 GaitAdapter，一种非重放式持续学习方法，结合 GPAK 模块和 EDSN 方法，通过图神经网络聚合步态模式并优化特征判别性。

Result: GaitAdapter 在多样化任务中表现出色，显著提升了步态识别的判别能力。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter 通过 GPAK 模块和 EDSN 方法，有效保留了从不同任务中获取的步态知识，显著提升了步态识别的判别能力，优于其他方法。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在参数规模、自校正能力和长视觉上下文任务中的表现不足，限制了其在文档任务中的应用。

Method: 提出了MACT，一个多智能体协作框架，包含规划、执行、判断和回答四个小规模智能体，通过混合奖励建模和智能体级混合测试时扩展优化性能。

Result: MACT在15个基准测试中的13个中领先，三个变体在平均得分中占据前三名。

Conclusion: MACT框架在视觉文档理解和视觉问答任务中表现出色，尤其在长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务中领先，同时保持了较小的参数规模。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

Method: 通过信息增强中和令牌聚合（NAVIA），包括直接增强[CLS]令牌嵌入和在浅层ViT中引入自适应偏置。

Result: NAVIA在多个OOD基准测试中性能提升超过2.5%，推理延迟降低20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决了ETTA挑战，显著提升了性能并降低了推理延迟。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

Conclusion: SlotMatch框架通过简单的知识蒸馏方法，成功地将复杂的教师模型知识转移至轻量级学生模型，不仅性能匹配甚至超越教师模型，还显著减少了参数数量和计算开销。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

Conclusion: DepthGait通过结合RGB衍生的深度图和剪影，显著提升了步态识别的性能，并在标准基准测试中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source
code of this paper will be released on

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG信号分类中因电极配置、采集协议和硬件差异导致的数据分布偏移问题。

Method: IMAC通过通道依赖掩码和插补自监督框架，将跨领域EEG数据对齐任务转化为空间时间序列插补问题，并采用3D到2D位置统一映射策略标准化电极布局。

Result: 在10个公开EEG数据集上，IMAC实现了最先进的分类准确率，并在模拟和真实分布偏移下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IMAC框架在跨领域EEG信号分类中表现出色，不仅提升了分类准确率，还显著增强了模型对数据分布变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: VideoGuard 是一种联合帧优化方法，通过扰动防止视频被未经授权的生成模型编辑，其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成技术的快速发展使得恶意个体可能滥用高保真数字内容的生成和编辑能力，而现有研究对视频内容编辑的保护存在显著不足。

Method: 采用联合帧优化，将所有视频帧视为一个优化实体，并融合视频运动信息到优化目标中，通过微妙的扰动干扰生成扩散模型的功能。

Result: 通过客观和主观指标验证，VideoGuard 的保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard 是一种有效的视频保护方法，能够防止未经授权的恶意编辑，其保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖提示级建模和大规模模型，由于T2I扩散模型输入令牌容量有限，常导致个性化不准确。

Method: 提出DrUM方法，结合用户画像和基于transformer的适配器，在潜在空间中进行条件级建模。

Result: DrUM在大规模数据集上表现优异，并能无缝集成开源文本编码器。

Conclusion: DrUM通过条件级建模在潜在空间中整合用户画像，显著提升了T2I扩散模型的个性化生成能力，且无需额外微调即可与主流T2I模型兼容。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨生成模型中普遍存在但未被充分研究的对象生成中的 demographic bias，填补了现有研究主要关注人类描绘偏见的空白。

Method: 论文方法包括引入SODA框架，通过比较带有 demographic cues 和中性提示生成的对象的视觉属性，分析了三个先进模型生成的2,700张图像。

Result: 研究结果揭示了特定 demographic groups 与视觉属性之间的强烈关联，包括由性别或种族提示引发的重复颜色模式，以及一些模型生成较少多样化的输出，从而放大了与中性提示的视觉差异。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，提出的SODA框架为系统测量生成模型中的偏见提供了实用方法，揭示了当前生成模型中仍存在的刻板印象，是迈向更系统、负责任AI开发的重要一步。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Motivation: 探讨血清脂质亚类与视网膜微血管特征之间的关系，填补脂质组学与视网膜血管关联的研究空白。

Result: FA与视网膜血管扭曲相关，CE与动静脉平均宽度相关，而DAG和TAG与动静脉宽度和复杂性呈负相关。

Conclusion: 视网膜微血管结构反映了不同的循环脂质谱，支持其作为系统性代谢健康的非侵入性标志物的作用。

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动主动学习（CSAL）在医学图像分析中缺乏基准，且现有方法依赖自监督学习（SSL），效率低且特征表示不足。预训练基础模型（FMs）具有强大特征提取能力，但尚未在CSAL任务中得到充分研究。

Method: 提出了MedCAL-Bench，首个系统性基于FMs的CSAL基准，评估了14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个数据集上的表现，覆盖分类和分割任务。

Result: 实验结果显示：1) 大多数FMs是有效的CSAL特征提取器，DINO系列在分割任务中表现最佳；2) FMs在分割任务中性能差异较大，分类任务中差异较小；3) 不同数据集应选择不同样本选择策略，ALPS在分割任务中表现最佳，RepDiv在分类任务中领先。

Conclusion: 大多数基础模型（FMs）在冷启动主动学习（CSAL）中是有效的特征提取器，其中DINO系列在分割任务中表现最佳。不同样本选择策略应根据数据集选择，ALPS在分割任务中表现最佳，而RepDiv在分类任务中领先。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Conclusion: MetaScope不仅在最先进的金属透镜分割和修复方法中表现优异，还在真实生物医学场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Conclusion: 本研究发现了一种在基于流的生成模型中使用分类器自由引导（CFG）时的不稳定性问题，并提出了一种简单且理论上有依据的自适应引导调度方法，有效解决了这一问题。该方法在保持或提高生成质量的同时，显著提升了采样速度。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Conclusion: CoPS框架通过动态提示合成和空间感知对齐机制，显著提升了零样本异常检测的性能，在多个数据集上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet,

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提出的双摄像头框架在图像和视频去摩尔纹任务中显著优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

TL;DR: LRQ-DiT是一种针对DiT模型的低比特量化框架，通过TLQ和ARS解决了权重和激活量化问题，在保持图像质量的同时优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但其高计算成本和参数量在资源受限场景中难以应用。现有PTQ方法在极端低比特设置下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出了LRQ-DiT框架，包括Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ)和Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS)，分别针对权重和激活的量化问题进行优化。

Result: 在PixArt和FLUX模型上验证，LRQ-DiT在COCO、MJHQ和sDCI数据集上表现出色，有效减少了量化误差并保持了图像质量。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT成功实现了在低比特设置下对DiT模型的高效量化，同时保持了图像质量，优于现有的PTQ基线方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

TL;DR: 本文探讨稀疏字典学习中不同优化方法对稀疏性的影响，发现高稀疏性通常不影响恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏性是学习解的重要属性，但需要在SDL中平衡稀疏性与恢复质量。本文旨在探讨不同优化方法下解的稀疏性及其对恢复质量的影响。

Method: 本文通过多种优化方法研究稀疏字典学习（SDL）中解的稀疏性，并比较不同方法下的稀疏性表现。

Result: 发现不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性表现，高稀疏性通常不会损害恢复质量。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高稀疏性通常不会影响图像恢复质量，即使恢复的图像与学习数据库差异较大。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉医学数据中的多层次语义关系，导致检索结果不可靠。PECM旨在解决这一问题，提升医学图像与报告之间的对齐准确性。

Method: 提出了Prototype-Enhanced Confidence Modeling (PECM)框架，采用多级原型捕捉语义变异性，并利用双流置信度估计和自适应加权机制控制高不确定性数据对检索排名的影响。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务（包括全监督和零样本检索）上，PECM实现了高达10.17%的性能提升，达到了新的最佳效果。

Conclusion: PECM框架通过引入多级原型和双流置信度估计，显著提升了跨模态检索的精确性和一致性，尤其在处理医学数据的模糊性和变异性方面表现优异，确立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个自动化流程来构建服装编辑数据集，并引入了Fashion Edit Score作为评估指标，最终构建了包含20,596个高质量三元组的EditGarment数据集。

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CD-FSMIS模型依赖大量源域训练，限制了模型的通用性和部署便捷性。利用自然图像的大型视觉模型（如SAM）来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了Multi-center Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP)策略，包括多中心提示生成、不确定性感知提示选择和自适应提示优化三个创新点，结合预训练的DINOv2特征编码器实现。

Result: MAUP在三个医学数据集上实现了精确的分割效果，优于传统CD-FSMIS模型和无训练的FSMIS模型。

Conclusion: MAUP策略通过引入多中心自适应不确定性感知提示，成功将SAM模型应用于CD-FSMIS任务，无需额外训练，取得了优于传统模型的分割效果。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

Motivation: 解决现有LReID方法在特定分布感知和跨域统一知识学习方面的不足，以平衡旧知识保留与新信息适应。

Method: 设计了分布感知模型、自适应知识巩固（AKC）、统一知识关联（UKA）机制和基于分布的知识转移（DKT）方法。

Result: DKUA在抗遗忘和泛化能力上分别实现了7.6%和5.3%的平均mAP/R@1提升。

Conclusion: 提出的DKUA框架通过分布感知知识统一与关联，显著提升了LReID任务中的抗遗忘和泛化能力，实验结果显示其性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Motivation: 组织样本通常大于标准显微镜载玻片，需要拼接多个碎片以处理整个结构（如肿瘤）。自动化拼接是实现规模化分析的前提，但受限于组织准备过程中的损失、形态变形不均、染色不一致、载玻片上的错位或组织边缘磨损等问题。

Method: 使用基于视觉组织病理学基础模型的潜在特征表示来识别不同碎片中的相邻区域，并通过大量语义匹配候选进行鲁棒的姿态估计，形成WMS。

Result: 在三个不同的组织病理学数据集上的实验表明，SemanticStitcher能够稳健地生成WMS拼接，并在正确边界匹配方面持续优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher通过利用视觉组织病理学基础模型的潜在特征表示，显著提高了全载玻片（WMS）的拼接性能，并在多个数据集上验证了其优于现有方法的边界匹配准确性。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Conclusion: CoEmoGen通过结合多模态大语言模型和心理学启发的HiLoRA模块，显著提升了情感图像生成的语义连贯性和情感忠实度，并通过EmoArt数据集展示了其高扩展性。

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large-scale, open-source dataset for converting spoken math to LaTeX, using ASR and audio language models to significantly improve accuracy over existing methods, with CERs of 28% and 27% on key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of converting spoken mathematics into LaTeX is crucial for educational and research applications but remains underexplored, with existing approaches having limitations such as the need for multiple transcriptions, limited datasets, and lack of multilingual coverage.

Method: The study utilizes ASR post-correction models, few-shot prompting, and audio language models to transcribe and convert spoken mathematical expressions into LaTeX.

Result: The proposed models achieve a character error rate (CER) of 28% on the MathSpeech benchmark and outperform the MathSpeech model by over 40 percentage points on the S2L-equations benchmark (27% vs. 64%). Additionally, an equation CER of 40% is achieved on the newly established S2L-sentences benchmark.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for future advancements in multimodal AI, particularly in the recognition of mathematical content, by providing a comprehensive dataset and demonstrating improved performance in converting spoken mathematics to LaTeX.

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for
LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for
mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER
of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI,
with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that

Result: 在爱尔兰历史地图系列上验证了该方法的高性能和效率，成功识别出一个可能在大饥荒期间被废弃的定居点。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种针对乡村地图的高效且可扩展的机器学习流程，能够显著提升历史建筑足迹的提取效率，并在历史与考古发现中展现出潜力。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现出优越性能，包括二分图像分割、伪装目标检测等。

Conclusion: SAM2-UNeXT通过简单架构实现更准确的分割，为下游任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadProPoser 是一种概率编码器-解码器架构，用于雷达人体姿态估计，通过变分推断联合预测关节位置和不确定性，实现了低误差和可靠的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于雷达的人体姿态估计（HPE）提供了一种保护隐私、不受光照影响的感知模式，但受到噪声和多径效应测量的挑战。

Method: RadProPoser 是一个概率编码器-解码器架构，处理来自紧凑型3发射器、4接收器MIMO雷达的复值雷达张量。通过将变分推断纳入关键点回归，RadProPoser 联合预测26个三维关节位置以及异方差随机不确定性，并可重新校准以预测总不确定性。探索了使用高斯和拉普拉斯分布作为潜在先验和似然的不同概率公式。

Result: 在新发布的光学运动捕捉地面真实数据集上，RadProPoser 实现了整体平均每关节位置误差（MPJPE）为6.425厘米，45度视角下为5.678厘米。学习到的不确定性与实际姿态误差有很强的对齐性，并可校准以产生可靠的预测区间，最佳配置的预期校准误差为0.021。此外，从潜在分布中采样可实现有效的下游活动分类数据增强，F1得分为0.870。

Conclusion: RadProPoser 是首个基于雷达张量的端到端人体姿态估计系统，能够从原始雷达张量数据中明确建模和量化每个关节的不确定性，为雷达应用中可解释且可靠的人体运动分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

TL;DR: DyCAF-Net通过动态类别感知融合网络解决了目标检测中的遮挡、杂乱和类别不平衡问题，显著提升了性能并保持高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前目标检测中的静态融合启发式和类别无关注意力限制了在动态场景（如遮挡、杂乱和类别不平衡）中的性能。

Method: 引入了三项创新：(1) 基于输入条件的平衡颈部结构，通过隐式固定点建模迭代优化多尺度特征；(2) 双重动态注意力机制，利用输入和类别依赖线索自适应调整通道和空间响应；(3) 类别感知特征适应，调制特征以突出稀有类别的判别区域。

Result: DyCAF-Net在13个多样化基准测试中显著提升了精度、mAP@50和mAP@50-95，同时保持了计算效率（约11.1M参数）和竞争力推理速度。

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net通过动态类别感知融合网络，显著提升了动态场景下目标检测的精度和适应性，同时在计算效率和推理速度上保持竞争力，适用于医疗影像、监控和自动驾驶等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决卫星图像受限的挑战，特别是云层覆盖和夜间条件对多光谱影像可用性的限制。

Method: 采用了一种新颖的多阶段训练方法，基于条件潜在流匹配，并首次将余弦调度与流匹配结合。

Result: CloudBreaker表现出色，生成的光学影像FID得分为0.7432，NDWI和NDVI的SSIM分别为0.6156和0.6874，显示出高保真度和结构相似性。

Conclusion: CloudBreaker被确立为一种有前景的解决方案，适用于多光谱数据通常不可用或不可靠的广泛遥感应用。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机的高动态范围和微秒级延迟特性为面部表情识别提供了丰富时空信息，但直接训练网络效率低，需探索更高效方法。

Method: 采用对抗生成方法预训练特征提取器（用于面部重建任务），并迁移其编码器权重至表情识别系统；结合LSTM捕捉长期动态，并引入TIE事件表示。

Result: 在e-CK+数据库上，evTransFER比现有方法精度提升至少25.9个百分点，识别率达93.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的evTransFER框架通过迁移学习和新型事件表示TIE，显著提升了基于事件相机的面部表情识别性能，在e-CK+数据库上达到93.6%的识别率。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Result: 在LINEMOD和SPEED+数据集上，FPG-NAS模型在严格FLOPs约束下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FPG-NAS是首个专为6DoF物体姿态估计设计的可微分NAS框架，通过任务特定搜索空间和可微分门控机制，在严格FLOPs约束下表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived
models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best
of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework
specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D
scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

Conclusion: Trokens通过将轨迹点转换为语义感知的关系令牌，结合语义感知采样策略和运动建模框架，显著提升了少样本动作识别的性能，在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

Motivation: 传统规划假设对象数量固定（DCA），但在实际应用中对象可能动态变化，现有方法无法直接适用，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 采用一阶逻辑对规划问题进行建模，限制初始理论为有限的、一致的流文字集合，并在规划时对动作序列进行实例化搜索。

Result: 提出的方法能够正确且完备地解决无DCA的有界规划问题，适用于特定类型的广义规划和一致性规划的交集问题。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种在动态对象变化环境下解决有界规划问题的方法，证明了方法的正确性和完备性，并通过概念验证实现展示了其可行性。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于位置的服务（LBS）数据提供了关于人类移动性的重要见解，但其稀疏性通常导致不完整的行程和活动序列，使得对行程和活动的准确推断变得困难。本研究提出了一个研究问题：我们能否利用来自高质量 LBS 数据的活动序列来恢复个体水平上的不完整活动序列？

Conclusion: VSNIT 在活动序列恢复任务中表现出更高的准确性和多样性，展示了其在增强 LBS 数据效用方面的潜力，为未来基于位置的研究和应用提供了一个有前景的框架。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS

study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

*Newman Cheng,Gordon Broadbent,William Chappell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLIO是一种新型AI推理方法，通过开放设计和原位优化显著提升了大语言模型在科学问题上的准确性和可操控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI开发框架在科学发现中缺乏准确性和透明度的同时，科学家还需要对推理过程的可操控性。CLIO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入了一种名为CLIO的方法，通过原位优化实现对大语言模型（LLMs）的深度和精确控制，使其能够自我制定问题解决策略、在自信不足时调整行为，并为科学家提供最终信念或答案。

Result: CLIO在未进行额外训练的情况下，在基于文本的生物和医学问题上实现了22.37%的准确率，相比基础GPT-4.1模型提升了13.82%（相对提升161.64%），并超越了OpenAI的o3性能。

Conclusion: CLIO通过其开放设计和内部机制，为科学决策过程提供了深入的洞察和控制，显著提升了AI在科学发现中的效用。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种多代理系统（MAS），用于提升放射学视觉问答（RVQA）的准确性和可靠性，解决了现有方法在事实准确性、幻觉和跨模态对齐方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和检索增强生成（RAG）的方法在RVQA中取得了进展，但仍面临事实准确性、幻觉和跨模态对齐的挑战。

Method: 通过设计一个多代理系统（MAS），包括专门用于上下文理解、多模态推理和答案验证的代理，来解决RVQA中的事实准确性、幻觉和跨模态对齐问题。

Result: 在通过模型分歧过滤筛选的具有挑战性的RVQA数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，该系统优于强大的MLLM基线，案例研究也证明了其可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了多代理系统（MAS）在放射学视觉问答（RVQA）中的潜力，能够支持需要复杂推理的可解释和可信赖的临床AI应用。

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出基于Countdown游戏的规划基准，解决现有基准不足，理论证明其复杂度，实验显示现有LLM方法难以应对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准无法有效衡量基础模型和代理的长期规划能力，要么任务定义松散，要么利用国际规划竞赛中的现有问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种创建规划基准的程序，围绕Countdown游戏设计，该游戏要求玩家通过算术运算从一组输入数字中形成目标数字。

Result: 通过理论分析证明该问题的计算复杂度（NP完全），并在实例生成上优于公共基准。评估显示现有LLM辅助规划方法在该动态基准上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于Countdown游戏的规划基准来解决现有基准在衡量基础模型和代理的长期规划能力方面的不足。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

Motivation: 由于资源限制，提升日语LLMs的性能具有挑战性，本文旨在寻找一种简单有效的方法来克服这一挑战。

Method: 受任务向量的启发，该方法通过提取推理LLMs在训练前后权重的变化来获取推理向量，并将其应用于日语LLMs。

Result: 该方法显著提升了日语LLMs的性能，并展示了在其他语言中应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种简单有效的方法，通过从推理LLMs中获取推理向量并应用于日语LLMs，显著提升了其性能，同时为其他语言提供了启发。

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

*Shane Caldwell,Max Harley,Michael Kouremetis,Vincent Abruzzo,Will Pearce*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PentestJudge利用LLM评估渗透测试代理的操作质量，通过树结构评分标准和F1分数比较，发现验证任务可能比生成更容易，为AI信息安全代理的可靠使用提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决程序化评估渗透测试代理操作质量的困难，开发一个能够全面且可扩展评估AI信息安全代理质量的系统。

Method: 开发了基于树结构的评分标准，将渗透测试任务分解为更小的子任务和简单的是非标准，由PentestJudge评估。比较LLM评分与人类专家评分，使用F1分数等标准二分类指标进行评估。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数达到0.83，工具使用能力强的模型更接近人类专家表现。不同模型在不同类型问题上表现各异，验证任务可能比生成任务更容易。

Conclusion: PentestJudge系统通过LLM作为评估者，能够有效评估渗透测试代理的操作质量，且验证任务可能比生成任务更容易。该方法为未来研究提供了基础，以确保AI信息安全代理在敏感生产环境中的可靠使用。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

*Songkun Yan,Zhi Li,Siyu Zhu,Yixin Wen,Mofan Zhang,Mengye Chen,Jie Cao,Yang Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AQUAH是首个专为水文建模设计的端到端语言代理，能根据自然语言提示自主完成从数据检索到报告生成的整个流程，初步实验效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过语言代理简化水文建模流程，降低专业门槛，使非专家也能轻松进行复杂的环境模拟。

Method: AQUAH通过视觉支持的大型语言模型驱动工作流程，自主检索地形、强迫和测量数据，配置水文模型，运行模拟，并生成自包含的PDF报告。

Result: 初步实验表明，AQUAH能在无需人工干预的情况下完成冷启动模拟，并生成被水文专家认为清晰、透明且物理上合理的结果文档。

Conclusion: AQUAH展示了以LLM为核心的、基于视觉的代理在简化复杂环境建模和降低地球观测数据、物理工具与决策者之间障碍方面的潜力。尽管仍需进一步的校准和验证以用于实际部署，但早期成果已显示出其前景。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Medblink基准测试显示，当前多模态语言模型在临床感知任务中表现远不如人类，需加强视觉基础以提升临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态语言模型在临床决策支持和诊断推理中表现出潜力，但临床医生对AI工具的采用高度选择性。若模型在看似简单的感知任务（如图像方向判断或CT扫描是否增强）上出错，则难以被临床采用。

Method: 研究团队引入了Medblink基准，涵盖8个临床相关任务，涉及多种成像模式和解剖区域，共包含1,429个多选题和1,605张图像。评估了19种最先进的MLMs，包括通用模型（如GPT4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet）和领域专用模型（如Med Flamingo、LLaVA Med、RadFM）。

Result: 人类标注者在Medblink基准上的准确率达到96.4%，而表现最佳的模型仅达到65%。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态语言模型（MLMs）在常规感知任务中表现不佳，准确率仅为65%，远低于人类标注者的96.4%，这表明需要加强其视觉基础以支持临床采用。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Polymath是一种自优化代理，通过动态层次化工作流和代码表示解决无标签数据的动态问题，实验显示其性能优于现有方法8.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于手动构建或标签数据训练的代理工作流方法在解决动态、无标签数据的现实问题时存在可扩展性和效率限制。

Method: 提出了一种结合任务流图灵活性和代码表示工作流表达能力的自优化代理Polymath，采用多网格启发式图优化和自我反思引导的进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在编码、数学和多轮问答任务的六个基准数据集上，Polymath相比现有最优方法平均提升了8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath通过动态层次化工作流和自我优化方法，显著提升了在无标签数据环境下解决动态问题的能力，相比现有基线方法平均提高了8.1%。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 提出了一种结合元认知和仲裁模块的框架，利用LLM自身的推理能力进行自我防护，无需依赖外部分类器。

Result: 在AdvBench和Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024数据集上测试，部分模型在增强模式下实现了完美或接近完美的防御成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs提供了一种轻量级、成本效益高的自我防御机制，显著提升了防御成功率，并在GenAI应用中具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Result: 实验结果显示代码减少60-80%，性能提升最高达3.1倍，并与现有函数调用标准完全兼容。

Conclusion: 本研究为工具增强型大语言模型（LLMs）的集成提供了理论架构洞察和实际解决方案，显著降低了开发成本并提升了性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）能力和自主性的提升，评估其输出（尤其是在开放性和复杂任务中）已成为关键瓶颈，需要可扩展且细致的替代方案。

Method: 定义了'代理作为评判者'的概念，追溯了从单一模型评判到动态多代理辩论框架的演变，并批判性地评估了其优势和不足。

Result: 比较了不同方法在可靠性、成本和人类对齐方面的表现，并调查了在医疗、法律、金融和教育等领域的实际应用。

Conclusion: 基于代理的评判可以作为人类监督的补充（而非替代），标志着向下一代LLMs可信、可扩展评估迈出的一步。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

Conclusion: BPO框架通过自改进数据飞轮，在稀疏奖励环境中为长期规划任务提供了高效的推理模型，显著提升了性能并降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

Motivation: 现有学习型MILP方法独立处理各模块策略学习，忽视了模块间的相互依赖，导致求解速度和质量受限。

Method: 提出了一种基于Stackelberg博弈的多智能体策略学习框架（Collab-Solver），通过两阶段学习范式（数据通信策略预训练和模块间策略协调）协同优化多个模块的策略。

Result: 在合成和大规模真实MILP数据集上，联合学习的策略显著提高了求解性能，且策略在不同实例集上泛化能力优异。

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过多智能体策略学习框架显著提升了混合整数线性规划（MILP）的求解性能，并在不同实例集上展示了优秀的泛化能力。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Motivation: 探究ICL在NLP任务中高度非线性行为的潜在机制，尤其是在LLMs中解决ODE问题的能力。

Method: 论文通过将标准ODE问题及其解构造成序列提示，评估GPT-2模型在这些任务上的表现，包括对两类ODE的实验。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-2能够学习元ODE算法，收敛行为与欧拉方法相当或更优，且随着演示数量的增加实现指数级精度提升，同时具备良好的OOD泛化能力。

Conclusion: 论文通过实验展示了GPT-2在ICL设置下能够有效学习和解决ODE问题，并具备鲁棒的泛化能力，为理解ICL机制及其在非线性数值问题中的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在复杂医疗诊断任务中因推理深度不足导致信息丢失或逻辑跳跃，需改进以提升临床推理能力。

Method: 提出Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR)框架，采用树状结构记录推理路径和临床证据，并引入交叉验证机制确保多智能体决策一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，ToR框架在真实医疗数据上表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR) 框架通过树状结构和交叉验证机制显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂医疗诊断任务中的表现，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法主要依赖浅层模式匹配，难以应对新颖和未见的攻击策略，因此需要一种更通用的防御机制。

Method: 提出了认知驱动防御（CDD）框架，结合监督微调和熵引导的强化学习算法（EG-GRPO）来识别和推理越狱提示的底层结构。

Result: 实验表明，CDD在防御性能和泛化能力上均达到最优水平。

Conclusion: CDD框架通过结合结构化推理链和强化学习，显著提升了对未见过的越狱攻击的防御能力，实现了最先进的防御性能。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ContractEval是首个评估开源与专有LLMs在商业合同法律风险识别中表现的基准，发现专有模型整体更优，开源模型需针对性优化以适用于高风险的司法环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在专业领域（如法律风险分析）中的潜力，特别是在本地部署开源LLMs以保护数据机密性的背景下。

Method: 使用Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD)评估了4个专有和15个开源LLMs，分析了它们在识别商业合同中条款级法律风险方面的表现。

Result: 专有模型在正确性和输出效果上优于开源模型，但某些开源模型在特定维度上具有竞争力。开源模型在规模增大时表现更好，但改进速度放缓。推理模式提高输出效果但降低正确性。开源模型更频繁生成“无相关条款”回应，可能存在“懒惰”思维或提取相关内容信心不足的问题。模型量化加速推理但牺牲性能。

Conclusion: ContractEval提供了一个坚实的基准，指导未来法律领域大型语言模型的发展。虽然大多数LLMs的表现与初级法律助理相当，但开源模型需要针对高风险的司法环境进行有针对性的微调，以确保正确性和有效性。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AHD方法仅设计单一启发式，导致在不同分布或设置下泛化性差。

Method: 提出了Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD)框架，并开发了Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S)算法，利用互补种群管理和互补感知的模因搜索机制。

Result: 在三个AHD任务上的实验表明，EoH-S显著优于现有方法，性能提升高达60%。

Conclusion: 通过AHSD和EoH-S，我们成功解决了现有AHD方法在泛化性上的不足，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述在捕捉复杂需求（如系统行为、条件逻辑和架构约束）时存在歧义，难以正确推断和处理服务导向架构中的隐式数据依赖。

Method: 1. 引入增强的统一建模语言（UML）序列图，整合决策表和API规范，消除语言歧义。2. 提出数据依赖推断（DDI）任务，构建显式数据依赖图。3. 通过新颖的提示策略将DDI形式化为约束数学推理任务，并辅以静态解析和依赖剪枝。

Result: UML2Dep框架通过形式化规范和DDI任务，显著减少了复杂规范的上下文复杂性，提高了推理的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为UML2Dep的逐步代码生成框架，通过利用无歧义的形式化规范来弥补自然语言描述的不足，显著提高了代码生成的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有基于DDPM的方法存在高推理延迟和输出变异性大的问题，限制了其在现实表格数据中的应用。

Method: MissDDIM采用条件扩散框架，基于Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models（DDIM）进行表格数据填补。

Result: MissDDIM在保持多样性的同时，显著降低了推理延迟并减少了输出变异性。

Conclusion: MissDDIM通过采用DDIM框架，显著降低了推理延迟并减少了输出变异性，为表格数据填补提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

TL;DR: T2UE是一种仅通过文本描述生成不可学习示例的新框架，解决了现有方法需要暴露原始数据的隐私悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有不可学习示例生成方法需要暴露原始图像数据给第三方服务的问题，提出了T2UE框架。

Method: T2UE利用文本到图像（T2I）模型将文本描述映射到图像（噪声）空间，并结合误差最小化框架生成有效的不可学习噪声。

Result: 实验表明，T2UE保护的数据显著降低了最先进模型在下游任务（如跨模态检索）中的性能。

Conclusion: T2UE框架通过仅使用文本描述生成不可学习的示例，实现了‘零接触数据保护’，有效解决了隐私悖论问题。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Conclusion: 本研究通过提出AgentSME框架，验证了Echo通信模式在生成式教育代理中的优越性，为智能教育模型的改进提供了宝贵信息。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

TL;DR: Geoint-R1 是一个多模态推理框架，旨在解决现有模型在正式几何推理中的不足，通过整合辅助元素构建和正式验证，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在正式几何推理方面存在困难，尤其是在动态构建和验证辅助几何元素时。

Method: Geoint-R1 整合了辅助元素构建、通过 Lean4 表示的正式推理以及交互式可视化。

Result: Geoint-R1 能够从文本描述和视觉图表中生成可正式验证的几何解决方案，并在 Geoint 基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: Geoint-R1 显著超越了现有的多模态和数学专用推理模型，特别是在需要显式辅助元素构建的挑战性问题中。

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However,
most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments
with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants,
encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility.
This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting
learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent.
Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of

Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior
knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing
different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of
InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with

TL;DR: ETDNet通过全历史图和并行模块设计，显著提升了时间图建模的性能，适用于交通和金融领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建模实体间随时间变化的交互对于许多现实任务至关重要，如交通预测和金融欺诈检测，需要明确表示关系及其演化。

Method: 提出了一种全历史图表示方法，并设计了ETDNet网络，包含图注意力模块、多头时间注意力模块和融合模块，分别处理时间步内和时间步间的边。

Result: 在Waymo驾驶员意图预测任务中，联合准确率提升至75.6%（原74.1%）；在Elliptic++比特币欺诈检测任务中，非法类F1分数提升至88.1%（原60.4%）。

Conclusion: 通过将结构和时间关系表示为单一图中的不同边，ETDNet在驾驶员意图预测和比特币欺诈检测任务中显著优于现有方法，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

Motivation: 现有研究在工具增强的视觉问答（VQA）中表现良好，但在真实世界工具使用和多步骤推理方面存在显著差距。

Method: 提出了ToolVQA数据集和ToolEngine数据生成流水线，采用深度优先搜索（DFS）和动态上下文示例匹配机制。

Result: ToolVQA数据集包含23K实例，涵盖10种多模态工具和7个任务领域。微调的7B LFMs在测试集和OOD数据集上表现优于GPT-3.5-turbo。

Conclusion: ToolVQA和ToolEngine的引入显著提升了大型基础模型在真实世界工具使用场景中的表现，特别是在多模态和多步骤推理任务中。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

Motivation: 现有记忆系统在基本记忆单元定义和知识提取机制上存在局限性，无法实现真正的学习和进化。

Method: Nemori采用了两步对齐原则和预测校准原则，分别受到事件分割理论和自由能原理的启发，自主组织对话流并主动学习预测差距。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有最先进系统，尤其在长上下文中优势明显。

Conclusion: Nemori通过其创新的自组织记忆架构，显著提升了大型语言模型在长期互动中的自主代理能力，特别是在长上下文环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Motivation: LLMs在使用CoT提示时生成的冗长推理过程存在高冗余，导致推理成本增加和效率降低，需解决此问题。

Method: 通过理论分析和广泛的实证验证，引入步骤熵度量冗余，并提出结合SFT和GRPO强化学习的两阶段训练策略，使LLM能自主生成压缩的CoT。

Result: 实验表明，80%的低熵中间步骤可被剪枝且对最终答案准确性影响极小，显著提升了推理效率。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于步骤熵的CoT压缩框架，显著提升了LLM的推理效率，同时保持了准确性，为实际部署和对推理结构的深入理解提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for cognitive impairment assessment from speech lack generalizability across languages and clinical settings, limiting practical utility.

Method: Evaluation using a unified multimodal pipeline on three speech datasets (ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, CIR-E) spanning English and Mandarin, comparing conventional deep learning models and LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Conventional models degrade significantly across domains, while LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting adapt better but remain sensitive to prompt design. LoRA fine-tuning significantly enhances generalization in target domains.

Conclusion: LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought prompting and LoRA fine-tuning show promise for improving cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability in speech-based cognitive impairment assessment, advancing toward clinically useful tools.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在通用逻辑推理任务上表现不佳，缺乏确定性和可解释性。神经符号AI试图将逻辑融入神经网络，但两种主流方法的性能对比尚未明确。

Method: 本文介绍了两种神经符号方法：整合方法（integrative approach）和混合方法（hybrid approach），并分别以Logic Neural Network（LNN）和LLM-Symbolic Solver（LLM-SS）作为案例研究。

Result: 分析表明，混合方法在通用逻辑推理任务上表现更优。

Conclusion: 混合方法（hybrid approach）在开发通用逻辑推理方面更具潜力，因为其推理链更可解释，且保留了现有大型语言模型的能力和优势。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

Method: 提出了Hide and Seek Game (HSG)动态对抗框架，包含两个对抗角色：Sneaky（生成隐蔽错误）和Diagnosis（检测错误），通过对抗性协同进化提升错误隐蔽性和诊断准确性。

Result: 在多个数学推理任务上，HSG显著提升了错误诊断准确率，比GPT-4o等基线模型高出16.8%--31.4%。同时发布了一个具有挑战性的隐蔽错误数据集作为未来研究基准。

Conclusion: HSG框架通过对抗性角色动态生成和诊断错误，显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂错误识别和诊断方面的能力，尤其在数学问题解决任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: MOID结合了LLM代理和多目标优化，在单次运行中自动生成多种诊断建议，为恢复模型可行性和决策提供了更实用的见解。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 公开可用的医学数据快速增长，导致科学文献数量与其应用之间的差距扩大，医疗专业人员难以系统性地审查和理解最新知识。

Conclusion: 该研究为医学从业者提供了一个集中、实时更新且可持续的知识来源，并可能成为多种领域类似成果的基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

TL;DR: SmartGen 是一个基于LLM的框架，通过合成上下文感知的用户行为数据，解决智能家居模型因行为漂移导致的性能下降问题，实验显示性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居模型通常基于静态数据集训练，难以应对行为漂移（如季节性变化、生活方式改变等）。由于新数据收集成本高、速度慢且涉及隐私问题，直接重训练模型不切实际。

Method: SmartGen 包括四个关键组件：1) 时间和语义感知分割模块；2) 语义感知序列压缩；3) 图引导序列合成；4) 两阶段异常过滤器。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，SmartGen 显著提升了模型在行为漂移下的性能，异常检测和行为预测分别平均提升85.43%和70.51%。

Conclusion: SmartGen 框架通过合成上下文感知的用户行为数据，显著提升了智能家居模型在行为漂移情况下的异常检测和行为预测性能，平均提升分别为85.43%和70.51%。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

TL;DR: EDCIM是一种通过错误检测与纠正优化LLM在数学任务中表现的方法，平衡成本与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多步推理中常产生中间错误，导致最终预测不准确，且在生成数学表达式或源代码时难以遵守指定格式。

Method: EDCIM通过生成方程组、符号错误检测框架和针对性反馈机制，结合轻量级开源LLM与强大专有模型，优化效率与准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，EDCIM在不同数据集上有效减少了成本和错误，提升了准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM（可解释数学的错误检测与纠正）方法显著降低了计算和财务成本，同时在适当配置平衡时保持甚至提高了预测准确性。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

TL;DR: 研究分析了Transformer训练中大规模激活的出现动态，发现其遵循可预测的数学模式，并开发了预测框架，证明模型设计可预测和控制这些现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管之前的工作已经在完全训练的模型中描述了大规模激活现象，但其在训练过程中出现的时间动态仍不清楚。

Method: 使用Pythia模型家族作为测试平台，通过系统分析不同模型大小和多个训练检查点，展示了大规模激活的出现遵循可预测的数学模式，并开发了一个机器学习框架来预测这些参数。

Result: 大规模激活的出现遵循可预测的数学模式，可以通过一个具有五个关键参数的指数调制对数函数准确建模，并且可以通过机器学习框架从架构规格中预测这些参数。

Conclusion: 研究发现，大规模激活的出现是由模型设计决定的，可以在训练开始前预测并可能控制，这对模型稳定性、训练周期长度、可解释性和优化有重要影响。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

TL;DR: 本文提出FPBench框架，评估LLMs在错误前提下的代码生成表现，发现模型自我审查能力不足，并揭示了错误前提触发的缺陷模式。研究为开发可靠代码生成模型提供了理论和实践支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）代码生成能力的进步，其对输入前提的依赖加剧。用户提供包含错误前提的输入时，代码生成幻觉的概率显著增加，暴露了其自我审查能力的不足。

Method: 本文提出了FPBench，第一个针对错误前提的代码生成评估框架，通过系统构建三类错误前提并整合多维评估指标，对15个代表性LLM进行了深入评估。

Result: 关键发现包括：(1) 大多数模型在错误前提下的推理能力和代码生成性能较差，严重依赖显式提示进行错误检测，自我审查能力有限；(2) 错误前提触发了资源投入的收益递减点，盲目增加长度无法提升质量；(3) 三类错误前提分别激活模型中的不同缺陷模式，揭示了代码生成模型认知机制的三重分离。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅强调了LLMs在代码生成中主动验证前提的迫切需求，还通过提出的FPBench框架和多维评估系统，为开发可靠、以人为中心的代码生成模型提供了理论基础和实践路径。

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Motivation: 现有算法（如匹配滤波和深度神经网络）在引力波信号识别中存在计算量大和黑盒决策逻辑的问题，需探索更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合树结构搜索、进化优化和大语言模型启发式，创建可解释的算法解决方案。

Result: 在MLGWSC-1基准数据集上，Evo-MCTS比现有最佳算法性能提升20.2%，并生成高性能且可解释的算法变体。

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS框架不仅在性能上超越了现有方法，还提供了可解释的算法路径，为计算科学领域的自动化算法发现提供了可转移的方法论。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中强化学习训练与代理紧密耦合或依赖序列拼接与掩码的问题，实现代理执行与训练的完全解耦。

Conclusion: Agent Lightning 提供了一个灵活且可扩展的框架，通过解耦代理执行与训练，实现了与多种现有代理的无缝集成，并通过实验验证了其在真实世界代理训练和部署中的潜力。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

Motivation: 研究单侧扩展图中的着色和独立集问题具有重要的理论和实际意义。尽管已有一些进展，但现有算法的效率和适用范围仍有改进空间。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供更优的算法和硬度结果。

Method: 本文采用算法设计和理论分析相结合的方法，重点关注单侧扩展图的谱性质。通过新的分层策略和矩阵分析，提出了针对不同条件的多项式时间算法，并辅以硬度证明。

Result: 本文的主要结果包括：1）在多项式时间内找到相对大小为1/2-o(1)的独立集或几乎完全的3-着色；2）在强正则单侧扩展图中提出1.6667-近似的顶点覆盖算法；3）通过矩阵分层证明了特定条件下的NP难性，并给出了多项式时间可解的充分条件。

Conclusion: 本文通过研究单侧扩展图及其相关图类的着色和独立集问题，提出了新的算法保证和匹配的硬度结果。特别地，我们改进了Bafna等人的工作，提供了更高效的算法，并在特定条件下解决了NP难问题。此外，我们还发现了一种新的图谱性质，为后续研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We establish new algorithmic guarantees with matching hardness results for
coloring and independent set problems in one-sided expanders and related
classes of graphs. For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided
expander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative
size at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$
fraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$
with the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This
result improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025)
developing an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative
size at least $0.01$ in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient
$1.6667$-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong
regular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\epsilon)$-factor
approximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\epsilon>0$.
  We propose a new stratification of $k$-COLORING in terms of $k$-by-$k$
matrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove
that whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem
is NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the
other hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the
corresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time.
  As starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph
spectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The
number of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\tau$ is at most $O(1/\tau^{2})$
times the number of eigenvalues larger than $\tau^{2}/2$. While this result
allows us to bound the number of eigenvalues bounded away from $0$ in one-sided
spectral expanders, this property alone is insufficient for our algorithmic
results.

Result: 算法在时间n^{O(r/ε²)}内，为n顶点3-可着色图找到至少(1/2−O(ε))n个顶点的适当3-着色。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新算法，能够在具有小1-sided阈值秩的3-可着色图中找到大的独立集，并证明了其结果的紧性。

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for finding large independent sets in
$3$-colorable graphs with small $1$-sided threshold rank. Specifically, given
an $n$-vertex $3$-colorable graph whose uniform random walk matrix has at most
$r$ eigenvalues larger than $\varepsilon$, our algorithm finds a proper
$3$-coloring on at least $(\frac{1}{2}-O(\varepsilon))n$ vertices in time
$n^{O(r/\varepsilon^2)}$. This extends and improves upon the result of Bafna,
Hsieh, and Kothari on $1$-sided expanders. Furthermore, an independent work by
Buhai, Hua, Steurer, and V\'ari-Kakas shows that it is UG-hard to properly
$3$-color more than $(\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon)n$ vertices, thus establishing
the tightness of our result.
  Our proof is short and simple, relying on the observation that for any
distribution over proper $3$-colorings, the correlation across an edge must be
large if the marginals of the endpoints are not concentrated on any single
color. Notably, this property fails for $4$-colorings, which is consistent with
the hardness result of [BHK25] for $4$-colorable $1$-sided expanders.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文通过组合学洞察改进了de Bruijn图上的算法，当位置范围相对于k较小时，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of efficiently reconstructing a best string from a de Bruijn graph given domain knowledge, which translates into intervals for edges in an Eulerian trail.

Method: The method involves combinatorial insights leading to exponential-time improvements over existing algorithms, specifically for de Bruijn graphs parametrized by w (log w + 1)/(k-1).

Result: The result is an improved algorithm that outperforms the state-of-the-art, particularly when the range of positions is small relative to k.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with an improved algorithm for the de Bruijn graph problem, showing that a small range of positions relative to k is sufficient for efficient computation.

Abstract: The reduction of the fragment assembly problem to (variations of) the
classical Eulerian trail problem [Pevzner et al., PNAS 2001] has led to
remarkable progress in genome assembly. This reduction employs the notion of de
Bruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$. A single
Eulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini
et al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX
2020] based on $z$-anonymity.
  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a
de Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function
maps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in
the reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the
latter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an
interval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the
following basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we
efficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et
al.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.
  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain
knowledge in the complexity. Ben-Dor et al. developed an algorithm to solve the
problem on de Bruijn graphs in $O(m \cdot w^{1.5} 4^{w})$ time, where $m=|E|$
and $w$ is the maximum interval length over all edges. Bumpus and Meeks
[Algorithmica 2023] rediscovered the same algorithm on temporal graphs,
highlighting the relevance of this problem in other contexts. We give
combinatorial insights that lead to exponential-time improvements over the
state-of-the-art. For the important class of de Bruijn graphs, we develop an
algorithm parametrized by $w (\log w+1) /(k-1)$. Our improved algorithm shows
that it is enough when the range of positions is small relative to $k$.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）代理在结构化操作环境中因非确定性而受限的问题。

Method: 提出基于'Blueprint First, Model Second'哲学的Source Code Agent框架，将专家定义的操作程序编码为基于源代码的执行蓝图，并由确定性引擎执行。

Result: 在tau-bench基准测试中，Source Code Agent以平均Pass^1分数超出最强基线10.1个百分点，显著提升执行效率。

Conclusion: Source Code Agent框架通过分离工作流逻辑与生成模型，实现了在严格程序逻辑应用中的可验证和可靠部署。

Abstract: While powerful, the inherent non-determinism of large language model (LLM)
agents limits their application in structured operational environments where
procedural fidelity and predictable execution are strict requirements. This
limitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic,
high-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative
process. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new
paradigm built on the "Blueprint First, Model Second" philosophy. Our framework
decouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined
operational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution
Blueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is
strategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex
sub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark,
designed for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the
Source Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the
strongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while
dramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable
and reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict
procedural logic.

Conclusion: 结合性能分析和程序语义的深度学习方法能够有效提升性能分析工具的可操作性，帮助软件工程师更直观地识别程序中的性能问题。

Abstract: Profiling tools (also known as profilers) play an important role in
understanding program performance at runtime, such as hotspots, bottlenecks,
and inefficiencies. While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give
extra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are
responsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable
optimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users
to associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users
are not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.
  In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles
and program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean
code summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it
into a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for
actionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async
Profiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a
fine-tuned CodeBERT-based model. We demonstrate the code summaries of any
selected call path in a graphic user interface. Our system can effectively
assist analysis on many Java benchmarks.

Abstract: Maintaining code quality in large-scale software systems presents significant
challenges, particularly in settings where a large numbers of engineers work
concurrently on a codebase. This paper introduces Code Quality Score (CQS)
system to automatically detect issues with a set of code changes and provide
actionable insights. At its core, the CQS system is powered by two Llama3

code quality issues related to coding best practices and b) to provide good
``critiques'' for LLM-generated code review respectively. To maintain good user
experience, we layer the system with hand-crafted rules to filter out incorrect
responses/hallucinations. Offline evaluations show that our CQS system is able
to achieve an impressive precision rate for identifying valid issues. This
system has already been rolled out to developers in an industrial scale setting
and has consistently achieved 60\% week over week user helpfulness rate,

Result: 研究揭示了专家在证明开发过程中的三种策略和多种非正式实践，这些实践虽未体现在最终代码中，但对任务结果有预测性。研究还提出了AI证明助手的设计指南。

Conclusion: 本研究通过用户研究揭示了专家在使用F*和Verus时的证明开发策略和非正式实践，并基于这些发现提出了AI证明助手的设计指南。通过一个F*证明代理的案例研究，展示了这些建议的有效性。

Abstract: Proof-oriented programming languages (POPLs) empower developers to write code
alongside formal correctness proofs, providing formal guarantees that the code
adheres to specified requirements. Despite their powerful capabilities, POPLs
present a steep learning curve and have not yet been adopted by the broader
software community. The lack of understanding about the proof-development
process and how expert proof developers interact with POPLs has hindered the
advancement of effective proof engineering and the development of
proof-synthesis models/tools.
  In this work, we conduct a user study, involving the collection and analysis
of fine-grained source code telemetry from eight experts working with two
languages, F* and Verus. Results reveal interesting trends and patterns about
how experts reason about proofs and key challenges encountered during the proof
development process. We identify three distinct strategies and multiple
informal practices that are not captured final code snapshots, yet are
predictive of task outcomes. We translate these findings into concrete design
guidance for AI proof assistants: bias toward early specification drafting,
explicit sub-goal decomposition, bounded active errors, and disciplined
verifier interaction. We also present a case study of an F* proof agent
grounded in these recommendations, and demonstrate improved performance over
baseline LLMs

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个自动化程序修复工具，显著减少了静态分析警报数量，并验证了其修复效果和性能影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态分析工具产生的许多警报是误报，识别真正的阳性警报并修复相关代码需要大量努力。APR工具可以显著减少SA警报数量并降低手动审查的工作量。

Method: 研究通过设计、开发和性能测试一个APR工具，该工具能够修复由多个SA工具产生的3类警报相关的C/C++代码。修复方法简单且局部化。

Result: APR工具在一个代码库中修复了9234个警报中的8718个，能够修复3类缺陷。对于2类缺陷、2个SA工具和2个代码库，该工具平均修复或排除了超过80%的警报。测试显示修复未显著降低代码性能或引发新警报。

Conclusion: 本研究通过设计和开发一个自动化程序修复（APR）工具，显著减少了静态分析（SA）工具产生的警报数量，并降低了分析师手动审查代码的工作量。研究还促使CERT编码标准的维护者重新评估和更新了用于检测或修复指南违规的指标。

Abstract: (Note: This work is a preprint.) Static analysis (SA) tools produce many
diagnostic alerts indicating that source code in C or C++ may be defective and
potentially vulnerable to security exploits. Many of these alerts are false
positives. Identifying the true-positive alerts and repairing the defects in
the associated code are huge efforts that automated program repair (APR) tools
can help with. Our experience showed us that APR can reduce the number of SA
alerts significantly and reduce the manual effort of analysts to review code.
This engineering experience paper details the application of design,
development, and performance testing to an APR tool we built that repairs C/C++
code associated with 3 categories of alerts produced by multiple SA tools. Its
repairs are simple and local. Furthermore, our findings convinced the
maintainers of the CERT Coding Standards to re-assess and update the metrics
used to assess when violations of guidelines are detectable or repairable. We
discuss engineering design choices made to support goals of trustworthiness and
acceptability to developers. Our APR tool repaired 8718 out of 9234 alerts
produced by one SA tool on one codebase. It can repair 3 flaw categories. For 2
flaw categories, 2 SA tools, and 2 codebases, our tool repaired or dismissed as
false positives over 80% of alerts, on average. Tests showed repairs did not
appreciably degrade the performance of the code or cause new alerts to appear
(with the possible exception of sqlite3.c). This paper describes unique
contributions that include a new empirical analysis of SA data, our selection
method for flaw categories to repair, publication of our APR tool, and a
dataset of SA alerts from open-source SA tools run on open-source codebases. It
discusses positive and negative results and lessons learned.

TL;DR: REFINE是一个自动化框架，通过生成质量逐步降低的代码工件和优化评估器配置，提升LLM在代码评估中的可靠性，已在IBM内部成功应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为代码评估器的可靠性不足，人工评估成本高且不可扩展，现有自动化方法无法识别细微的质量差异。

Method: REFINE框架包含两个模块：Hierarchy Dataset Builder自动生成质量逐步降低的代码工件，Evaluator Tester通过量化评估器配置与预期排序的一致性来优化评估器。

Result: REFINE在IBM内部开发流程中应用，显著提升了评估器配置的准确性，使某些编码任务的对齐分数从0.7以下提升至0.9以上。

Conclusion: REFINE框架成功提升了LLM作为代码评估器的可靠性，使其在工业环境中能够敏感地识别细微的质量差异，并支持模型发布决策。

Abstract: Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language
models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However,
establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human
evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated
methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.
  We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation),
an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software
engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder
applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with
progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate
evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with
expected ordering.
  A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of
degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse
filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.
  While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the
practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's
internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and
summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using
industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that
lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks.
These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams
to support model release decisions.

Motivation: 全球老龄化社会对包容性技术的需求增加，传统开发方法存在无障碍和个性化障碍，亟需工具支持开发适应老年人的软件。

Method: 采用基于访谈的实证研究，对18名软件从业者进行了评估。

Conclusion: 本文通过访谈研究评估了AdaptForge工具，提出了支持开发无障碍和自适应软件的低代码工具设计建议，并指出了开发者对此类工具的期望。

Abstract: The global ageing population presents a growing societal challenge, creating
an urgent need for inclusive technologies that promote autonomy among older
adults. Software practitioners can address this by delivering digital services
that enhance seniors' independence and reduce reliance on routine support from
family members and healthcare infrastructure. However, traditional development
practices, constrained by time and resources, often result in applications with
major accessibility and personalisation barriers. Increasing pressure from
regulatory requirements, such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA), and the
personal empathy many developers feel toward supporting their older loved ones
and their own future selves have created a demand for tools that support the
development of accessible and adaptive software. To address this demand, this
paper presents an interview-based empirical study with 18 software
practitioners, evaluating AdaptForge: a low-code model-driven engineering (MDE)
tool that enables the efficient creation of accessible and adaptive
applications for senior users by mitigating development constraints through
automated code generation. Based on these insights, we identify developer
expectations for adopting such tools as industry-standard solutions and provide
empirically grounded recommendations for designing low-code tools that support
accessible and adaptive software development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成评估数据集存在局限性，如缺乏可运行测试用例、偏离真实代码分布及仅支持Python，影响评估结果可信度。

Method: 引入MRG-Bench基准，支持多语言、真实代码库数据及可运行测试用例，并设计实验分析生成错误的根本原因。

Result: 实验表明，当前模型在理解用户需求方面表现不佳，且不同编程语言的上下文影响差异显著。

Conclusion: 当前仓库级代码生成技术存在显著性能缺陷，主要原因是模型难以准确理解用户需求。不同编程语言需要设计专门的上下文信息以提升性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation. However, current evaluation datasets suffer from issues such
as the lack of runnable test cases, deviation from the distribution of
real-world code, and the ability to evaluate only the Python language. These
limitations undermine the credibility of the evaluation results.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MRG-Bench} (Multi-language
Repository-level Code Generation Benchmark), a novel dataset that provides a
more accurate evaluation of LLMs in practical repository-level code generation
tasks. MRG-Bench has three main features: (1) practical data sourced from
real-world code repositories that align to the practical distribution, (2)
multiple programming languages support, including Python, Java, and Go, and (3)
project-level runnable test cases to assess the quality of the generated code.
  Based on MRG-Bench, we conducted extensive experiments including large
language models, long-context models, and RAG-related methods. These evaluation
results demonstrate that \textbf{current repository-level code generation
techniques suffer from significant performance deficiencies}. To further
investigate why models fail, we designed novel experiments to annotate the
underlying causes of generation errors. The results explicitly show that the
majority of methods suffer from "\textbf{difficulty in understanding user
requirements}," failing to comprehend their assigned tasks accurately.
Moreover, the impact of different repository-level contexts on this issue
exhibits significant disparities across different programming languages,
suggesting that, in practice, specialized contextual information needs to be
designed for different languages.

Motivation: 解决软件问题定位中的语义鸿沟和复杂的多跳推理挑战。

Method: 提出了ToolTrain，一个两阶段工具集成训练框架，结合了拒绝采样的监督微调和工具集成的强化学习。

Result: ToolTrain训练的模型在问题定位上实现了最先进的性能，32B模型甚至超过了Claude-3.7在函数级定位上的表现。

Conclusion: 训练用于问题定位是改进自动化软件开发的一种可行且有效的策略。

Abstract: Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need
modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in
software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue
descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code
dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating
repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a
demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively
utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning
and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a
two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled
supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance
LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental
results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art
performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level
localization. The results also show that improved localization performance
translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further
demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective
strategy for improving automated software development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SysMBench是一个用于评估LLMs生成系统模型能力的基准，包含151个场景。评估显示LLMs表现不佳，最高BLEU为4%，SysMEval-F1为62%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统模型开发因模型描述语言的特定语法和公开模型示例的稀缺而具有挑战性。尽管LLMs在生成编程语言代码方面表现出潜力，但目前缺乏评估其生成特定描述语言系统模型能力的基准。

Method: 提出了SysMBench，包含151个人工策划的场景，涵盖多个流行领域和不同难度级别。每个场景包括自然语言需求描述、特定模型描述语言表达的系统模型以及可视化系统模型图。引入SysMEval作为语义感知评估指标。

Result: 评估了17个流行的LLMs，使用三种传统指标和SysMEval，结果显示LLMs在SysMBench上表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在SysMBench上表现不佳，最高BLEU仅为4%，SysMEval-F1为62%。SysMBench及其评估框架的发布将支持未来基于LLM的系统模型生成研究。

Abstract: System models, a critical artifact in software development, provide a formal
abstraction of both the structural and behavioral aspects of software systems,
which can facilitate the early requirements analysis and architecture design.
However, developing system models remains challenging due to the specific
syntax of model description languages and the relative scarcity of public model
examples. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
code with programming languages and could potentially aid in system model
development, no benchmarks currently exist for evaluating their ability to
generate system models with specific description languages. We present
SysMBench, which comprises 151 human-curated scenarios spanning a wide range of
popular domains and varying difficulty levels. Each scenario mainly comprises a
natural language requirements description, a system model expressed in a
specific model description language, and a visualized system model diagram. The
requirements description is fed as user input to the LLM, the system model with
description language is used to verify if the generated system model conforms
to the requirements, and the visualized diagram serves to support manual
validation. We introduce SysMEval, a semantic-aware evaluation metric to
evaluate the quality of generated system models. We evaluate 17 popular LLMs on
this task with three traditional metrics and SysMEval, from directly prompting
to three commonly used enhancement strategies. Our in-depth evaluation shows
that LLMs perform poorly on SysMBench, with the highest BLEU of 4% and
SysMEval-F1 of 62%. We release the SysMBench and its evaluation framework to
enable future research on LLM-based system model generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在软件工程任务中表现优异，但其实际部署面临高成本、长响应时间和性能波动等挑战，现有静态调度方法需大量训练数据且灵活性不足。

Method: SLS包含三个核心组件：自适应缓存管理器（减少冗余计算）、性能-成本优化调度器（动态分配任务）和动态更新管理器（实时优化策略）。

Result: 在日志解析和代码生成任务中，SLS显著优于基线方法，性能平均提升198.82%，处理时间减少63.28%。

Conclusion: SLS（SmartLLMs Scheduler）通过动态调度和实时反馈机制，显著提升了LLMs在软件工程任务中的性能表现和处理效率，平均性能提升198.82%，处理时间减少63.28%。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable
capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the
advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high
financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when
handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for
deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires
extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the
computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this
paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective
scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse
tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies
periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an
Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic
Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed
queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and
minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler
dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted
performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific
features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and
scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to
enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate
the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based
software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The
results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving
an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time
reduction of 63.28%.

Conclusion: GUI-ReRank框架通过结合快速嵌入检索和MLLM重排序技术，显著提升了GUI检索的准确性和泛化能力，同时提供了自定义GUI库的便捷工具。

Abstract: GUI prototyping is a fundamental component in the development of modern
interactive systems, which are now ubiquitous across diverse application
domains. GUI prototypes play a critical role in requirements elicitation by
enabling stakeholders to visualize, assess, and refine system concepts
collaboratively. Moreover, prototypes serve as effective tools for early
testing, iterative evaluation, and validation of design ideas with both end
users and development teams. Despite these advantages, the process of
constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming,
frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise. Recent research has
sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches,
which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models
for specific GUI repositories. However, these methods often suffer from limited
retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets.
In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid
embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based
reranking techniques. GUI-ReRank further introduces a fully customizable GUI
repository annotation and embedding pipeline, enabling users to effortlessly
make their own GUI repositories searchable, which allows for rapid discovery of
relevant GUIs for inspiration or seamless integration into customized LLM-based
RAG workflows. We evaluated our approach on an established NL-based GUI
retrieval benchmark, demonstrating that GUI-ReRank significantly outperforms
SOTA tailored LTR models in both retrieval accuracy and generalizability.
Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive cost and efficiency analysis of
employing MLLMs for reranking, providing valuable insights regarding the
trade-offs between retrieval effectiveness and computational resources. Video:

Method: 采用混合代理（MoA）方法，结合多个专用LLM直接合成代码，并与TurinTech AI的遗传算法（GA）集成系统及单个LLM优化器进行对比。

Result: MoA在开源模型上表现优异，节省14.3%至22.2%成本，优化时间加快28.6%至32.2%；GA在商业模型中更具优势，两种集成方法均优于单个LLM。

Conclusion: 本研究通过混合代理（MoA）方法在受监管环境中实现了高质量代码优化，同时保持成本效益，为工业应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization
have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering
at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries
face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize
commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements,
creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization
while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a
Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple
specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm
(GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world
industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application
to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical
evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost
savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated
environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with
commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4)
Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations,
generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble
evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing
regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

Conclusion: KANT 为代码理解提供了一个可扩展、低延迟、本地部署的强有力基础，显著减少了推理延迟并提高了人类评估的偏好。

Abstract: Repository-level code comprehension and knowledge sharing remain core
challenges in software engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise by generating explanations of program structure and logic. However,
these approaches still face limitations: First, relevant knowledge is
distributed across multiple files within a repository, aka semantic
fragmentation. Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade
performance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm
attention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often
outdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy
and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented
Neural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into
both training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access
to repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding
inference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data
directly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context,
reducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise
deployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the
synthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions;
compare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference
speed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability.
Results show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking
needs. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack
expert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to
85% across all models. Overall, it is well-suited for scalable, low-latency,
on-premise deployments, providing a strong foundation for code comprehension.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI systems in 6G software businesses presents both
strategic opportunities and significant challenges. While such systems promise
increased autonomy, scalability, and intelligent decision-making across
distributed environments, their adoption raises concerns regarding technical
immaturity, integration complexity, organizational readiness, and
performance-cost trade-offs. In this study, we conducted a preliminary thematic

scanning, we identified 29 motivators and 27 demotivators, which were further
categorized into five high-level themes in each group. This thematic mapping
offers a structured overview of the enabling and inhibiting forces shaping
organizational readiness for agentic transformation. Positioned as a

TL;DR: StoneDetector是一个用于检测Java代码克隆的平台，基于支配树路径的文本比较，能有效识别各种类型的代码克隆，并在基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码克隆在软件开发中普遍存在，可能导致项目膨胀和漏洞传播，因此识别代码克隆至关重要。

Method: 基于支配树表示的路径的文本比较，StoneDetector实现了传统的克隆检测方法，支持多种字符串度量和哈希算法。

Result: 在多个先进基准测试中，StoneDetector展示了其在检测Java源代码和字节码中代码克隆的性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: StoneDetector作为一种传统克隆检测平台，在Java源代码和字节码中检测代码克隆方面表现出色，具有高性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Copy & paste is a widespread practice when developing software and, thus,
duplicated and subsequently modified code occurs frequently in software
projects. Since such code clones, i.e., identical or similar fragments of code,
can bloat software projects and cause issues like bug or vulnerability
propagation, their identification is of importance. In this paper, we present
the StoneDetector platform and its underlying method for finding code clones in
Java source and Bytecode. StoneDetector implements a conventional clone
detection approach based upon the textual comparison of paths derived from the
code's representation by dominator trees. In this way, the tool does not only
find exact and syntactically similar near-miss code clones, but also code
clones that are harder to detect due to their larger variety in the syntax. We
demonstrate StoneDetector's versatility as a conventional clone detection
platform and analyze its various available configuration parameters, including
the usage of different string metrics, hashing algorithms, etc. In our
exhaustive evaluation with other conventional clone detectors on several
state-of-the-art benchmarks, we can show StoneDetector's performance and
scalability in finding code clones in both, Java source and Bytecode.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs在多语言漏洞修复中展现出潜力，GPT-4o在少量示例提示下表现优异，Go语言修复效果最佳，C/C++最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法仅限于特定编程语言（如C/C++），而LLMs具有语言无关的能力和强大的语义理解潜力，但现有研究对其修复效果评估不足。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，比较了自动漏洞修复方法和最先进的LLMs在七种编程语言中的表现。

Result: 结果显示，经过指令调优的GPT-4o在少量示例提示下表现优异，与领先方法VulMaster竞争激烈，且在修复独特漏洞和最严重漏洞时表现更优。Go语言在所有模型类型中表现最佳，而C/C++表现最差。

Conclusion: 本研究首次探讨了跨多语言的漏洞修复方法和大语言模型（LLMs）的表现，展示了LLMs在多语言漏洞修复中的潜力，并分析了其失败案例的原因。

Abstract: Various Deep Learning-based approaches with pre-trained language models have
been proposed for automatically repairing software vulnerabilities. However,
these approaches are limited to a specific programming language (C/C++). Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities
and strong semantic understanding, exhibiting potential to overcome
multilingual vulnerability limitations. Although some work has begun to explore
LLMs' repair performance, their effectiveness is unsatisfactory. To address
these limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate
the performance of automated vulnerability repair approaches and
state-of-the-art LLMs across seven programming languages. Results show GPT-4o,
instruction-tuned with few-shot prompting, performs competitively against the
leading approach, VulMaster. Additionally, the LLM-based approach shows
superior performance in repairing unique vulnerabilities and is more likely to
repair the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Instruction-tuned GPT-4o
demonstrates strong generalization on vulnerabilities in previously unseen
language, outperforming existing approaches. Analysis shows Go consistently
achieves the highest effectiveness across all model types, while C/C++ performs
the worst. Based on findings, we discuss the promise of LLM on multilingual
vulnerability repair and the reasons behind LLM's failed cases. This work takes
the first look at repair approaches and LLMs across multiple languages,
highlighting the promising future of adopting LLMs for multilingual
vulnerability repair.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BitsAI-Fix是一种基于LLM的自动化lint错误修复工作流，通过上下文扩展和渐进式强化学习训练策略，在企业环境中实现了高准确率的代码修复，展示了LLM在大规模工业场景中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着企业代码库规模和复杂性的增长，lint错误数量远超工程师的手动修复能力，导致技术债务的持续积累和开发效率的降低。本文旨在解决这一工业规模环境中的关键挑战。

Method: BitsAI-Fix采用tree-sitter进行上下文扩展，通过专门训练的LLM生成搜索替换格式的补丁，并通过lint扫描重新验证输出最终修复结果。此外，该方法还引入了渐进式强化学习（RL）训练策略和基于规则的奖励机制。

Result: 在ByteDance的生产部署中，该解决方案支持了超过5,000名工程师，解决了12,000多个静态分析问题，修复准确率约为85%，每周活跃用户约1,000名。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了基于LLM的代码修复解决方案在企业环境中的实际可行性，并为大规模工业场景中的自动化代码修复提供了参考。

Abstract: As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume
of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to
continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency.
This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow
based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical
challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for
context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through
specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final
remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative
progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can
automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start
phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through
feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted
rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness
rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff
matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production
deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers,
resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85%
remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work
demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions
in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in
large-scale industrial scenarios.

TL;DR: LaTCoder通过Layout-as-Thought方法提升网页设计到代码生成中的布局准确性，实验证明其优于直接提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在设计到代码任务中布局保持不准确的问题。

Method: 提出LaTCoder方法，采用Layout-as-Thought（LaT）策略，首先将网页设计划分为图像块，然后通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）方法生成每个块的代码，最后通过绝对定位和MLLM-based两种组装策略动态选择最优输出。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用DeepSeek-VL2时，TreeBLEU分数提高了66.67%，MAE降低了38%，人工偏好评估中超过60%的案例更倾向于LaTCoder生成的网页。

Conclusion: LaTCoder通过Layout-as-Thought（LaT）方法显著提升了网页设计在代码生成中的布局保持能力，实验结果表明其在自动指标和人工偏好评估中均优于直接提示方法。

Abstract: Converting webpage designs into code (design-to-code) plays a vital role in
User Interface (UI) development for front-end developers, bridging the gap
between visual design and functional implementation. While recent Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in
design-to-code tasks, they often fail to accurately preserve the layout during
code generation. To this end, we draw inspiration from the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in human cognition and propose LaTCoder, a novel approach that
enhances layout preservation in webpage design during code generation with
Layout-as-Thought (LaT). Specifically, we first introduce a simple yet
efficient algorithm to divide the webpage design into image blocks. Next, we
prompt MLLMs using a CoTbased approach to generate code for each block.
Finally, we apply two assembly strategies-absolute positioning and an
MLLM-based method-followed by dynamic selection to determine the optimal
output. We evaluate the effectiveness of LaTCoder using multiple backbone MLLMs
(i.e., DeepSeek-VL2, Gemini, and GPT-4o) on both a public benchmark and a newly
introduced, more challenging benchmark (CC-HARD) that features complex layouts.
The experimental results on automatic metrics demonstrate significant
improvements. Specifically, TreeBLEU scores increased by 66.67% and MAE
decreased by 38% when using DeepSeek-VL2, compared to direct prompting.
Moreover, the human preference evaluation results indicate that annotators
favor the webpages generated by LaTCoder in over 60% of cases, providing strong
evidence of the effectiveness of our method.

*Iti Shree,Karine Even-Mendoz,Tomasz Radzik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReFuzzer通过LLM反馈循环改进测试程序有效性，显著提升代码覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的编译器模糊测试工具常生成语法或语义无效的测试程序，限制了其在测试编译器优化和后端组件中的有效性。

Method: ReFuzzer通过反馈循环与本地LLM验证和过滤错误程序，系统检测和修正编译及运行时违规。

Result: 测试程序的有效性提升至96.6-97.3%，处理时间平均为2.9-3.5秒/程序，关键组件的代码覆盖率显著增加（如向量化覆盖率提升9.2%、2.3%和7.1%）。

Conclusion: ReFuzzer显著提高了LLM生成的测试程序的有效性，从47.0-49.4%提升至96.6-97.3%，并在关键优化和IR生成组件中显著增加了代码覆盖率。

Abstract: Existing LLM-based compiler fuzzers often produce syntactically or
semantically invalid test programs, limiting their effectiveness in exercising
compiler optimizations and backend components. We introduce ReFuzzer, a
framework for refining LLM-generated test programs by systematically detecting
and correcting compilation and runtime violations (e.g. division by zero or
array out-of-bounds accesses). ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local
LLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving
fuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of
diverse yet valid test programs.
  We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box
fuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs'
validity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of
2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing
significantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR
generation components. For example, vectorization coverage had an absolute
improvement of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 7.1% in black-, grey-, and white-box fuzzing,
enhancing testing effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成编程练习任务和相关工件时，编写高质量且灵活的生成器具有挑战性，尤其是在需要生成多种相关工件时。

Method: 通过定义一组抽象构建块，并为每个构建块定义具体实现，然后通过组合这些抽象构建块来指定工件的结构，从而自动生成相关工件。

Result: 提出的方法能够生成多样化且符合习惯的代码，同时适用于多种上下文，提高了生成器的通用性和适应性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于抽象构建块的方法，用于自动生成编程练习任务和相关工件，提高了生成器的灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: When automatically generating programming exercise tasks one often also needs
to automatically generate programs. At the very least when providing sample
solutions is part of automated feedback. But programs can also be used as part
of the exercise task description to communicate a task's requirements.
  Writing good program generators that produce varied yet idiomatic code while
being easily adaptable for new tasks is challenging. The challenges are
intensified if task generation requires additional artifacts, like a more
general behavior specification for testing or additional textual descriptions.
Manually writing generators for multiple different but strongly related
artifacts gets complicated quickly.
  We present an approach where instead of writing monolithic generators for
multiple connected artifacts one specifies a small set of abstract building
blocks and for each such building block defines sets of concrete realizations
for various kinds of artifacts. Then the intended structure of the resulting
artifacts is specified as a composition of the small abstract building blocks.
This abstract description then serves as the common source from which related
artifacts can be derived automatically. The approach is generic in the kind of
artifacts it can produce and is therefore adaptable to a wide range of
contexts.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合数据相似性的Voronoi treemap算法，优化了邻域保持能力，并通过案例和定量分析验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Voronoi treemap仅能展示层次结构，无法同时反映数据属性（如相似性或共现特征），限制了其应用场景。

Method: 1. 在数据预处理阶段考虑相似性；2. 使用Kuhn-Munkres匹配将相似性映射到CVT细胞；3. 通过贪心交换优化细胞邻域；4. 迭代调整细胞大小以保持邻域关系。

Result: 通过多个真实案例（信息图和语言学）展示了算法的实用性，并使用树状图指标和邻域保持度进行了定量评估。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于数据相似性的Voronoi treemap算法，能够生成保持邻域关系的树状图，并通过真实案例和定量评估验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Voronoi treemaps are used to depict nodes and their hierarchical
relationships simultaneously. However, in addition to the hierarchical
structure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities,
frequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders
between countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding
vectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a
Voronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate
neighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline
to consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres
matching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to
create initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy
swapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's
similarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to
their respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods. We
demonstrate the practicality of our approach through multiple real-world
examples drawn from infographics and linguistics. To quantitatively assess the
resulting treemaps, we employ treemap metrics and measure neighborhood
preservation.

TL;DR: READ是首个实时扩散-Transformer框架，通过压缩潜在空间和异步噪声调度器，显著加速音频驱动说话头部生成，同时保持高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在音频驱动说话头部生成中表现出色，但推理速度极慢，限制了实际应用。本研究旨在解决这一问题，实现实时生成。

Method: READ框架采用时间VAE学习高度压缩的视频潜在空间，结合预训练的Speech Autoencoder生成音频潜在编码，并通过Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer进行建模。此外，异步噪声调度器（ANS）用于提升训练和推理效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，READ在生成质量和推理速度上均优于现有方法，尤其在长时间生成中保持了稳定的性能。

Conclusion: READ框架通过创新的异步噪声调度器和高效的潜在空间建模，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了推理速度，实现了实时音频驱动说话头部生成。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出CC-SIM仿真环境和DQN代理，通过学习有效减少无线网络中的LoS阻塞时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线环境复杂性增加，用户移动性和动态障碍物对LoS连接的维护带来挑战，移动基站(gNBs)通过物理重新定位来恢复或维持LoS，需要智能算法支持。

Method: 本文提出了CONVERGE Chamber Simulator (CC-SIM) 3D仿真环境，并开发了Deep Q-Network (DQN)代理来主动重新定位gNB。

Result: 实验表明，训练的代理在三个代表性用例中显著减少了LoS阻塞时间，最高达42%。

Conclusion: 基于学习的移动控制在自适应下一代无线网络中表现出显著效果，特别是在减少LoS阻塞时间方面。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of wireless environments, characterized by user
mobility and dynamic obstructions, poses challenges for the maintenance of
Line-of-Sight (LoS) connectivity. Mobile base stations (gNBs) stand as a
promising solution by physically relocating to restore or sustain LoS, thereby
necessitating the development of intelligent algorithms for autonomous movement
control.
  As part of the CONVERGE research project, which is developing an experimental
chamber to integrate computer vision (CV) into mobile networks and enhance
Quality of Service (QoS) in dynamic wireless environments, this paper presents
two key contributions. First, we introduce the CONVERGE Chamber Simulator
(CC-SIM), a 3D simulation environment for developing, training, and validating
mobility control algorithms for mobile gNBs. CC-SIM models user and obstacle
mobility, visual occlusion, and Radio Frequency (RF) propagation behavior. It
supports both offline reinforcement learning and real-time testing through
tight integration with a standalone 5G system via the OpenAirInterface (OAI) RF
simulator, enabling validation under realistic network conditions.
  Second, leveraging CC-SIM, we develop a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that
learns to reposition the gNB proactively in response to dynamic environmental
changes. Experiments across three representative use cases show that the
trained agent significantly reduces LoS blockage time - by up to 42% - when
compared to static deployments. These results highlight the effectiveness of
learning-based mobility control in adaptive next-generation wireless networks.

identity, and capability sharing has become essential. This paper surveys three
prominent registry approaches each defined by a unique metadata model: MCP's
mcp.json, A2A's Agent Card, and NANDA's AgentFacts. MCP uses a centralized
metaregistry with GitHub authenticated publishing and structured metadata for
server discovery. A2A enables decentralized interaction via JSON-based Agent
Cards, discoverable through well-known URIs, curated catalogs, or direct
configuration. NANDA Index introduces AgentFacts, a cryptographically
verifiable and privacy-preserving metadata model designed for dynamic
discovery, credentialed capabilities, and cross-domain interoperability. These
approaches are compared across four dimensions: security, scalability,
authentication, and maintainability. The paper concludes with suggestions and
recommendations to guide future design and adoption of registry systems for the
Internet of AI Agents.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents represents a paradigmatic shift
from traditional web architectures toward collaborative intelligent systems
requiring sophisticated mechanisms for discovery, authentication, capability
verification, and secure collaboration across heterogeneous protocol
environments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework addressing the
fundamental infrastructure requirements for secure, trustworthy, and
interoperable AI agent ecosystems. We introduce the NANDA (Networked AI Agents
in a Decentralized Architecture) framework, providing global agent discovery,
cryptographically verifiable capability attestation through AgentFacts, and
cross-protocol interoperability across Anthropic's Modal Context Protocol
(MCP), Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Microsoft's NLWeb, and standard HTTPS
communications. NANDA implements Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) principles,
extending traditional Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to address autonomous
agent security challenges including capability spoofing, impersonation attacks,
and sensitive data leakage. The framework defines Agent Visibility and Control
(AVC) mechanisms enabling enterprise governance while maintaining operational
autonomy and regulatory compliance. Our approach transforms isolated AI agents
into an interconnected ecosystem of verifiable, trustworthy intelligent
services, establishing foundational infrastructure for large-scale autonomous
agent deployment across enterprise and consumer environments. This work
addresses the critical gap between current AI agent capabilities and
infrastructure requirements for secure, scalable, multi-agent collaboration,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态端点解析在分布式异构环境中对AI代理通信的限制，支持基于地理、系统负载、代理能力和安全威胁等因素的实时端点选择。

Method: 代理通过Agent Fact卡片在Agent Registry/Index中广告其名称和上下文需求，请求代理通过注册表发现目标代理，并根据实际环境上下文解析目标代理名称以获取定制通信通道。

Result: AdaptiveResolver实现了上下文感知的实时通信端点选择，支持信任、服务质量和资源约束的协商，提供了灵活、安全且可扩展的代理间交互。

Conclusion: AdaptiveResolver为分布式异构环境中的AI代理通信提供了一个动态、灵活且可扩展的解决方案，超越了传统的客户端-服务器模型，支持未来生态系统复杂性的增长。

Abstract: AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address
the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in
distributed, heterogeneous environments. Unlike traditional DNS or static URLs,
AdaptiveResolver enables context-aware, real-time selection of communication
endpoints based on factors such as geographic location, system load, agent
capabilities, and security threats. Agents advertise their Agent Name and
context requirements through Agent Fact cards in an Agent Registry/Index. A
requesting Agent discovers a Target Agent using the registry. The Requester
Agent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication
channel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents.
The architecture supports negotiation of trust, quality of service, and
resource constraints, facilitating flexible, secure, and scalable
agent-to-agent interactions that go beyond the classic client-server model.
AdaptiveResolver provides a foundation for robust, future-proof agent
communication that can evolve with increasing ecosystem complexity.

Abstract: This work focuses on the development and assessment of modern wireless

beyond applications. To analyze the growing demands for data, and their impact,
we built an IEEE 802.11ah (WiFi Halow) office testbed for real-world

scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to consider
complex real-world IEEE 802.11ah implementations, aiming specifically to reveal
unexpected performance behaviors, such as significant throughput degradation
arising in closely deployed wireless links. Our findings show that intense
network contention and Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI), drastically impact
the performance of the wireless links involved. Beyond evaluating network
performance, our experimental analysis also considers the energy consumption of
the devices under test, offering a more holistic perspective on the feasibility
of IEEE 802.11ah in real-world deployments. The effective disclosure of such
unexpected phenomena, can lead to well planned decisions and energy consumption
optimization across the IoT to Cloud continuum.

Conclusion: 本文提出的ECO算法通过联合优化无人机轨迹、用户参与、功率分配和数据量控制，有效降低了系统总能耗，并通过仿真验证了其优于现有基线方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted federated
learning (FL) framework that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory, user
participation, power allocation, and data volume control to minimize overall
system energy consumption. We begin by deriving the convergence accuracy of the
FL model under multiple local updates, enabling a theoretical understanding of
how user participation and data volume affect FL learning performance. The
resulting joint optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we employ
alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA)
techniques to convexify the non-convex constraints, leading to the design of an
iterative energy consumption optimization (ECO) algorithm. Simulation results
confirm that ECO consistently outperform existing baseline schemes.

TL;DR: 5G非独立网络支持车辆云卸载，测试显示良好信号和低错误率，但需150毫秒以上往返时间才适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源密集型车辆算法的能耗和性能挑战，探索5G非独立网络在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 使用两种基于AI的算法（情绪识别和物体识别），在德国巴登-符腾堡州8.8公里的路线上进行测试，涵盖城市、乡村和森林区域。分析了两个平台：法兰克福的云边缘和曼海姆的云，采用多种部署策略。

Result: 平均信号质量84%，无连接中断；两种算法的包错误率低于0.1%；传输时间受地理位置和后端服务器网络连接影响较大。

Conclusion: 云卸载在5G非独立网络中显示出潜力，但需要确保往返时间超过150毫秒才能成为可行选项。

Abstract: Cloud-based offloading helps address energy consumption and performance
challenges in executing resource-intensive vehicle algorithms. Utilizing 5G,
with its low latency and high bandwidth, enables seamless vehicle-to-cloud
integration. Currently, only non-standalone 5G is publicly available, and
real-world applications remain underexplored compared to theoretical studies.
This paper evaluates 5G non-standalone networks for cloud execution of vehicle
functions, focusing on latency, Round Trip Time, and packet delivery. Tests
used two AI-based algorithms -- emotion recognition and object recognition --
along an 8.8 km route in Baden-W\"urttemberg, Germany, encompassing urban,
rural, and forested areas. Two platforms were analyzed: a cloudlet in Frankfurt
and a cloud in Mannheim, employing various deployment strategies like
conventional applications and containerized and container-orchestrated setups.
Key findings highlight an average signal quality of 84 %, with no connectivity
interruptions despite minor drops in built-up areas. Packet analysis revealed a
Packet Error Rate below 0.1 % for both algorithms. Transfer times varied
significantly depending on the geographical location and the backend servers'
network connections, while processing times were mainly influenced by the
computation hardware in use. Additionally, cloud offloading seems only be a
suitable option, when a round trip time of more than 150 ms is possible.

TL;DR: BiTHaC通过缓存TLS握手静态部分，显著减少带宽和计算开销，适用于资源受限的工业物联网。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TLS在工业物联网中因资源受限（带宽和计算）而应用受限，特别是握手过程开销大。

Method: 提出BiTHaC，利用重复TLS握手（尤其是证书）中的静态部分进行缓存，避免冗余信息传输和计算。

Result: 在wolfSSL中实现BiTHaC后，TLS握手带宽消耗减少61.1%，计算开销降低8.5%，内存开销可控。

Conclusion: BiTHaC通过双向TLS握手缓存有效减少了带宽消耗和计算开销，同时保持了TLS的严格安全保证，适用于资源受限的工业物联网环境。

Abstract: While TLS has become the de-facto standard for end-to-end security, its use
to secure critical communication in evolving industrial IoT scenarios is
severely limited by prevalent resource constraints of devices and networks.
Most notably, the TLS handshake to establish secure connections incurs
significant bandwidth and processing overhead that often cannot be handled in
constrained environments. To alleviate this situation, we present BiTHaC which
realizes bidirectional TLS handshake caching by exploiting that significant
parts of repeated TLS handshakes, especially certificates, are static. Thus,
redundant information neither needs to be transmitted nor corresponding
computations performed, saving valuable bandwidth and processing resources. By
implementing BiTHaC for wolfSSL, we show that we can reduce the bandwidth
consumption of TLS handshakes by up to 61.1% and the computational overhead by
up to 8.5%, while incurring only well-manageable memory overhead and preserving
the strict security guarantees of TLS.

TL;DR: Morphlux是一种新型光子互连架构，显著提升ML数据中心加速器间的带宽和利用率，减少碎片化，并通过硬件原型验证了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有商业多加速器计算服务器使用电互连，导致加速器间带宽不足，资源利用率低。光子互连技术有望解决这一带宽瓶颈。

Method: 开发了Morphlux，一种服务器规模的可编程光子互连架构，用于服务器内加速器间的互连，并通过硬件原型进行了性能验证。

Result: Morphlux将租户计算分配的带宽提升高达66%，计算碎片化减少高达70%，训练吞吐量提高1.72倍，并能在1.2秒内逻辑替换故障加速器。

Conclusion: 通过开发Morphlux这一可编程光子互连架构，成功提升了ML数据中心中加速器间的带宽，减少了计算碎片化，显著提高了训练吞吐量，并在硬件测试中展示了快速替换故障加速器的能力。

Abstract: We optically interconnect accelerator chips (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) within compute
servers using newly viable programmable chip-to-chip photonic fabrics. In
contrast, today, commercial multi-accelerator compute servers that are
workhorses of ML, use electrical interconnects to network accelerator chips in
the server. However, recent trends have shown an interconnect bandwidth wall
caused by accelerator FLOPS scaling at a faster rate than the bandwidth of the
interconnect between accelerators in the same server. This has led to
under-utilization and idling of GPU resources in cloud datacenters. We develop
Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric, to interconnect
accelerators within servers. We show that augmenting state-of-the-art photonic
ML-centric datacenters with Morphlux can improve the bandwidth of tenant
compute allocations by up to 66% and reduce compute fragmentation by up to 70%.
We develop a novel end-to-end hardware prototype of Morphlux to demonstrate
these performance benefits, which translate to 1.72x improvement in training
throughput of ML models. By rapidly programming the server-scale fabric in our
hardware testbed, Morphlux can logically replace a failed accelerator chip in
1.2 seconds.

Conclusion: 提出的低通信弹性分布式估计算法通过基于信誉的节点选择策略和W-SVDD模型，有效提升了多任务对抗网络中参数估计的准确性和抗攻击能力，同时降低了通信成本。

Abstract: In multi-task adversarial networks, the accurate estimation of unknown
parameters in a distributed algorithm is hindered by attacked nodes or links.
To tackle this challenge, this brief proposes a low-communication resilient
distributed estimation algorithm. First, a node selection strategy based on
reputation is introduced that allows nodes to communicate with more reliable
subset of neighbors. Subsequently, to discern trustworthy intermediate
estimates, the Weighted Support Vector Data Description (W-SVDD) model is
employed to train the memory data. This trained model contributes to reinforce
the resilience of the distributed estimation process against the impact of
attacked nodes or links. Additionally, an event-triggered mechanism is
introduced to minimize ineffective updates to the W-SVDD model, and a suitable
threshold is derived based on assumptions. The convergence of the algorithm is
analyzed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
achieves superior performance with less communication cost compared to other
algorithms.

interoperability of static nodes' information and runtime data exchanges.
Finally, we discuss the results from the piloting activities in the use cases
and the lessons learned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂、异构环境中，AI智能体的决策可能传播错误，而现有溯源技术无法捕捉智能体元数据（如提示、响应和决策）与工作流的关联。

Method: 引入PROV-AGENT模型，扩展W3C PROV并结合MCP协议，设计了一个近实时、开源的系统来捕获智能体溯源数据。

Result: 开发了一个针对智能体工作流的溯源模型，并通过跨设施（边缘、云和HPC）评估验证了其支持关键溯源查询和智能体可靠性分析的能力。

Conclusion: PROV-AGENT模型通过扩展W3C PROV并利用MCP协议，成功将智能体交互整合到端到端工作流溯源中，支持关键溯源查询和智能体可靠性分析。

Abstract: Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly
used as core components of AI agents in complex, large-scale workflows across
federated and heterogeneous environments. In agentic workflows, autonomous
agents plan tasks, interact with humans and peers, and shape scientific
outcomes. This makes transparency, traceability, reproducibility, and
reliability essential. However, AI-based agents can hallucinate or reason
incorrectly, and their decisions may propagate errors through the workflow,
especially when one agent's output feeds into another's input. Therefore,
fine-grained provenance is essential to link agent decisions, their end-to-end
context, and downstream impacts. While provenance techniques have long
supported reproducibility and workflow data understanding, they fail to capture
and relate agent-centric metadata (prompts, responses, and decisions) with the
rest of the workflow. In this paper, we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance
model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to
integrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance. Our
contributions include: (1) a provenance model tailored for agentic workflows,
(2) a near real-time, open-source system for capturing agentic provenance, and
(3) a cross-facility evaluation spanning edge, cloud, and HPC environments,
demonstrating support for critical provenance queries and agent reliability
analysis.

Conclusion: 论文重新审视了同步拜占庭协议问题的认知分析，提出了在特定条件下基于知识的程序可以产生最优协议，但指出这并非普遍适用。

Abstract: In order to develop solutions that perform actions as early as possible,
analysis of distributed algorithms using epistemic logic has generally
concentrated on ``full information protocols'', which may be inefficient with
respect to space and computation time. The paper reconsiders the epistemic
analysis of the problem of Simultaneous Byzantine Agreement with respect to
weaker, but more practical, exchanges of information. The paper first clarifies
some issues concerning both the specification of this problem and the knowledge
based program characterizing its solution, concerning the distinction between
the notions of ``nonfaulty'' and ``not yet failed'', on which there are
variances in the literature. It is then shown that, when implemented relative
to a given failure model and an information exchange protocol satisfying
certain conditions, this knowledge based program yields a protocol that is
optimal relative to solutions using the same information exchange. Conditions
are also identified under which this implementation is also an optimum, but an
example is provided that shows this does not hold in general.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the data movement bottleneck caused by the disparity between advancements in computing systems and memory technology, which affects parallel processing systems. The PiM paradigm is explored to mitigate this issue.

Method: The paper proposes a novel efficient solution for near-memory non-binary LDPC decoders in the UPMEM system, utilizing the processing in-memory (PiM) paradigm with thousands of low-complexity processing units.

Result: The PiM-based non-binary LDPC decoders achieve a decoding throughput of 76 Mbit/s, competitive with low-power GPU parallel solutions.

Conclusion: PiM-based non-binary LDPC decoders present a competitive solution for error correction, achieving 76 Mbit/s decoding throughput, comparable to edge GPU implementations.

Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are an important feature of several
communication and storage applications, offering a flexible and effective
method for error correction. These codes are computationally complex and
require the exploitation of parallel processing to meet real-time constraints.
As advancements in arithmetic and logic unit technology allowed for higher
performance of computing systems, memory technology has not kept the same pace
of development, creating a data movement bottleneck and affecting parallel
processing systems more dramatically. To alleviate the severity of this
bottleneck, several solutions have been proposed, namely the processing
in-memory (PiM) paradigm that involves the design of compute units to where (or
near) the data is stored, utilizing thousands of low-complexity processing
units to perform out bit-wise and simple arithmetic operations. This paper
presents a novel efficient solution for near-memory non-binary LDPC decoders in
the UPMEM system, for the best of our knowledge the first real hardware
PiM-based non-binary LDPC decoder that is benchmarked against low-power GPU
parallel solutions highly optimized for throughput performance. PiM-based
non-binary LDPC decoders can achieve 76 Mbit/s of decoding throughput, which is
even competitive when compared against implementations running in edge GPUs.

Motivation: 解决现有模型服务系统中基于启发式任务调度器的单点问题和性能瓶颈，通过分布式和预测性调度提升效率。

Method: Block采用完全分布式、无状态和预测性调度系统，利用LLM推理的确定性特征（如主机配置、响应长度和硬件性能）进行决策。

Result: 在12个GPU集群上的评估显示，Block比启发式调度器提升服务容量高达16.7%，降低P99尾延迟高达49.5%。

Conclusion: Block作为一种分布式调度框架，在大型语言模型服务中显著提升了负载均衡和自动扩展能力，其性能优势在不同模型、工作负载和配置中保持一致。

Abstract: This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to
optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large
language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from
incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic
and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed,
stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead,
reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable
characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response
lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on
accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block
significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up
to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance
gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations.

Abstract: Wearable assistive devices are increasingly becoming softer. Modelling their
interface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic
assistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical
modeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a
image-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces
for a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse
dataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method
accurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from
low-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and
actuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast
variations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that
the vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for
closed-loop control. This approach could be used as a non-intrusive alternative
for real-time force estimation for exosuits.

Conclusion: 可调刚度腿的设计显著提高了垂直跳跃机器人在不同地面条件下的能量效率，实验结果支持了这一假设。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable
Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time
tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various
ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By
adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric
for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform
better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while
stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and
energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the
best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground
stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state
hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our
hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in
controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides
insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting
leg stiffness.

workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key
requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings
encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as
concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and
contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to
undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to
provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry
appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for
Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by
thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of
the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险估计方法要么输出粗糙的全局场景级指标缺乏可解释性，要么缺乏与自动驾驶系统的具体集成，或仅针对特定驾驶场景。

Method: CRI采用方向感知的空间分区、动态安全信封、RSS原则、混合概率-最大融合策略以及自适应控制策略。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，CRI显著降低了碰撞率（车辆碰撞次数减少19%，每公里碰撞次数减少20%），提高了驾驶评分（17%），且运行时开销极低（每次决策周期3.6毫秒）。

Conclusion: CRI显著提高了在复杂、高风险环境中的安全性和鲁棒性，同时保持了模块化和低运行时开销。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk
assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs
coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes
indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses
narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk
Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks
based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting
control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning
within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)
principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation,
and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate
CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using
a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our
collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions
per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a
17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically
significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6
ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially
improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while
maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.

Abstract: This letter presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework
for simultaneous and accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain
geometry using a small set of fabric-based wearable soft sensors, with
efficient adaptation to unseen subjects and strong generalization across
different subjects and terrains. Compared to rigid alternatives such as
inertial measurement units, fabric-based soft sensors improve comfort but
introduce nonlinearities due to hysteresis, placement error, and fabric
deformation. Moreover, inter-subject and inter-terrain variability, coupled
with limited calibration data in real-world deployments, further complicate
accurate estimation. To address these challenges, the proposed framework
integrates MAML into a deep learning architecture to learn a generalizable
model initialization that captures subject- and terrain-invariant structure.
This initialization enables efficient adaptation (i.e., adaptation with only a
small amount of calibration data and a few fine-tuning steps) to new users,
while maintaining strong generalization (i.e., high estimation accuracy across
subjects and terrains). Experiments on nine participants walking at various
speeds over five terrain conditions demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms baseline approaches in estimating gait phase, locomotion mode, and
incline angle, with superior accuracy, adaptation efficiency, and
generalization.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of
occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper
introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

Abstract: Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters, have
become a pervasive environmental contaminant that accumulates on beaches due to
wind patterns and tidal forcing. Detecting microplastics and mapping their
concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing
this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that
automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces.
This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera
mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments
candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of
organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle
is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto
the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in
real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is
shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and
high microplastic classification accuracy.

Abstract: Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet
rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact
planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on
emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns
using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or
focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However,
models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are
based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the
challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain
absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations
and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order
model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion
mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models
(LLMs) and hybrid reasoning models present an opportunity to reimagine how
autonomous robots such as drones are designed, developed, and validated. Here,
we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human
input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a
real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed
and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone
in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry,
autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated
through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line
of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance,
code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded
architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete
command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,
though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context
window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of
AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as
emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work
sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more
broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future
robots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial
intelligence. In this initial work, a robot built a robot's brain.

Abstract: Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various
daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the
robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the
cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations
are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert
demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for
practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal
physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks.
Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert
data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered
environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the
robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and
compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that
our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training
compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance
in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates. Our demonstration

Abstract: Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that
aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and
factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on
pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and
explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction
between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target
object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should
grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during
handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects
target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs
the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit
preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences.
We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world
experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of
these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in
handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences. Our

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper compares a physics-based observer and a neural network model for estimating aerodynamic forces in a flapping-wing robot, showing both methods agree well in force measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is crucial for advancing control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic morphing capabilities, particularly for achieving closed-loop flight control.

Method: The paper investigates two methods: a physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics and a neural network-based regression model (MLP). The physics-based observer uses conjugate momentum and real-time sensor data, while the MLP learns from joint kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters.

Result: Both the conjugate momentum observer and the regression model demonstrate strong agreement in estimating aerodynamic forces, as validated by high-frequency load cell measurements during periodic wingbeats.

Conclusion: The conjugate momentum observer and the neural network-based regression model both show strong agreement in estimating aerodynamic forces across three components (Fx, Fy, Fz), validating their effectiveness for force estimation in flapping-wing aerial robots.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is essential for advancing the
control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic
morphing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate two distinct methodologies
for force estimation on Aerobat, a bio-inspired flapping-wing platform designed
to emulate the inertial and aerodynamic behaviors observed in bat flight. Our
goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a
crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a
physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the
concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on
the robot. This observer builds on the system's reduced-order dynamic model and
utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training
data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model,
specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint
kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic
force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a
high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force
measurements during periodic wingbeats. The conjugate momentum observer and the
regression model demonstrate strong agreement across three force components
(Fx, Fy, Fz).

Motivation: 当前机器人课程学习主要依赖人工设计的课程，这需要大量工程努力且可能受主观和次优设计选择影响。自动化课程学习在简单领域（如网格世界和游戏）中已取得成功，但机器人任务面临复杂任务空间和部分已知目标领域分布的挑战。

Result: GACL在轮式导航和四足机器人3D受限空间运动任务中表现出色，分别比现有最优方法提高了6.8%和6.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning (GACL) 在轮式导航和四足机器人3D受限空间运动任务中，分别比现有最优方法提高了6.8%和6.1%的成功率。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current
capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain
relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.
We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and
quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1%
higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each
domain.

Motivation: 传统统一的模型预测控制（MPC）框架因系统轻量级执行器的扭矩控制带宽低而受限，需克服这一挑战以实现推进器辅助的狭窄路径行走。

Method: 提出了一种分离控制架构：Raibert型控制器负责腿部运动的位置控制，而MPC调节推进器，并通过学习的接触残余动力学（CRD）来补偿腿与地面的碰撞效应。

Result: 通过仿真和硬件实验验证，分离控制架构结合CRD在推动恢复和猫式步态方面表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 分离控制架构结合接触残余动力学（CRD）在推动恢复和猫式步态方面表现更稳定，优于未使用CRD的分离控制器。

Abstract: Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, serves as a
research platform to explore unification of posture manipulation and thrust
vectoring. Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters
enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path
walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing
both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address
this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control
bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs
legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the
thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for
leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck
while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact
dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both
simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control
architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery
and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.

Abstract: Accurate and robust indoor localization is critical for smart building
applications, yet existing Wi-Fi-based systems are often vulnerable to
environmental conditions. This work presents a novel indoor localization
system, called LiGen, that leverages the spectral intensity patterns of ambient
light as fingerprints, offering a more stable and infrastructure-free
alternative to radio signals. To address the limited spectral data, we design a
data augmentation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
featuring two variants: PointGAN, which generates fingerprints conditioned on
coordinates, and FreeGAN, which uses a weak localization model to label
unconditioned samples. Our positioning model, leveraging a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) architecture to train on synthesized data, achieves
submeter-level accuracy, outperforming Wi-Fi-based baselines by over 50\%.
LiGen also demonstrates strong robustness in cluttered environments. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first system to combine spectral
fingerprints with GAN-based data augmentation for indoor localization.

Abstract: Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging
capability for mobile robots, which primarily encompasses two coupled tasks:
autonomous exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must
perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential
information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose
CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible
layouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how
humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on
the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our
planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy
between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path
planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph
representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps,
yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We
extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic
floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further
deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its
high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫级空中机器人目前只能跟踪非激进轨迹，而真实昆虫能执行高度敏捷的机动动作，这一性能差距源于机器人低惯性、快速动力学、扑翼空气动力学不确定性及对环境干扰的高敏感性。

Method: 设计了深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，并采用模仿学习方法训练一个两层全连接神经网络，模拟昆虫飞行控制架构。

Result: 机器人展示了类似昆虫的急转动作，侧向速度和加速度分别为197厘米/秒和11.7米/秒²，比之前结果提高了447%和255%。此外，机器人能在160厘米/秒的风干扰和大指令-力映射误差下执行急转机动，并在11秒内完成10次连续翻转。

Conclusion: 通过设计深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，研究团队在750毫克的扑翼机器人上展示了类似昆虫的飞行敏捷性和鲁棒性，标志着在昆虫尺度飞行敏捷性方面的重要里程碑。

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

Conclusion: SkeNavigator显著提升了基于手绘草图导航的性能，特别是在高抽象验证集上相对提高了105%的SPL。

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HEAD框架通过模块化方法，从人类运动和视觉感知数据中学习人形机器人的导航、移动和抓取技能，分为高层规划器和低层全身控制器，并在模拟和现实环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够直接从人类运动和视觉数据中学习的人形机器人系统，以实现在复杂环境中导航和抓取的能力。

Method: 采用模块化方法，高层规划器指挥手和眼睛的目标位置和方向，低层全身控制器从大规模人类运动捕捉数据中学习跟踪三个点（眼睛、左右手）。

Result: 在模拟和现实环境中验证了人形机器人在复杂环境中导航和抓取的能力。

Conclusion: HEAD框架通过模块化设计，有效分离了视觉感知与物理动作，提升了学习效率和在新场景中的可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery (HEAD), a framework that learns
navigation, locomotion, and reaching skills for humanoids, directly from human
motion and vision perception data. We take a modular approach where the
high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands
and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the
whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns
to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing
large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human
data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric
vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and
scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in
the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in
complex environments designed for humans.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种优化双足机器人Cassie跑步步态的方法，实现了高速跑步，并与人类步态进行了比较。最终，优化的步态成功应用于100米短跑控制器，创造了世界纪录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索双足机器人Cassie的跑步步态空间，优化其步态效率以实现高速跑步，并与人类跑步机制进行比较，以验证其效率。

Method: 提出了一种优化步态效率的方法，涵盖了从低速到极高速的广泛速度范围。通过与人类生物力学研究的比较，分析了步态的相似性。最后，将优化的跑步步态集成到满足100米短跑实际任务规则的控制器中。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管Cassie与人类在形态上存在差异，但其步态的关键特性在广泛的速度范围内与人类高度相似。通过将优化的跑步步态集成到控制器中，成功实现了双足机器人100米短跑的世界纪录。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot
Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait
efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a
Bipedal Robot.

*Sang Min Kim,Hyeongjun Heo,Junho Kim,Yonghyeon Lee,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Point2Act利用MLLMs和3D相关场，快速从自然语言描述中定位精确3D动作点，适用于通用机器人任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）实现通用机器人零样本任务执行，但现有方法在从2D语义推导精确3D动作点时存在困难。

Method: 提出3D相关场，绕过高维特征，直接利用轻量级2D点级指导，结合多视角聚合补偿几何模糊性和语义不确定性。

Result: 全栈流程（包括捕获、MLLM查询、3D重建和抓取姿态提取）能在20秒内生成空间接地响应，支持实际操控任务。

Conclusion: Point2Act通过3D相关场和多视角聚合，有效解决了从2D语义到精确3D动作点的转换问题，实现了在20秒内生成空间接地响应的全栈流程。

Abstract: We propose Point2Act, which directly retrieves the 3D action point relevant
for a contextually described task, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Foundation models opened the possibility for generalist robots that
can perform a zero-shot task following natural language descriptions within an
unseen environment. While the semantics obtained from large-scale image and
language datasets provide contextual understanding in 2D images, the rich yet
nuanced features deduce blurry 2D regions and struggle to find precise 3D
locations for actions. Our proposed 3D relevancy fields bypass the
high-dimensional features and instead efficiently imbue lightweight 2D
point-level guidance tailored to the task-specific action. The multi-view
aggregation effectively compensates for misalignments due to geometric
ambiguities, such as occlusion, or semantic uncertainties inherent in the
language descriptions. The output region is highly localized, reasoning
fine-grained 3D spatial context that can directly transfer to an explicit
position for physical action at the on-the-fly reconstruction of the scene. Our
full-stack pipeline, which includes capturing, MLLM querying, 3D
reconstruction, and grasp pose extraction, generates spatially grounded
responses in under 20 seconds, facilitating practical manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MPC-SafeGIL通过对抗性干扰增强模仿学习的安全性，利用MPC扩展安全关键场景覆盖，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习虽然在复杂机器人行为学习中表现优异，但其策略可能导致安全违规，限制了在安全关键应用中的部署。

Method: 使用基于采样的模型预测控制（MPC）来近似最坏情况干扰，适用于高维和黑盒动态系统。

Result: 在四足机器人运动和视觉运动导航等仿真及四旋翼飞行器的实际实验中，验证了方法在安全性和任务性能上的提升。

Conclusion: MPC-SafeGIL通过在专家演示中注入对抗性干扰，有效提升了模仿学习的安全性，并在仿真和实际实验中验证了其性能提升。

Abstract: Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex
robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make
errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in
safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach
that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial
disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader
range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn
robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive
Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to
high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work
that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates
safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach
through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor
navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating
improvements in both safety and task performance. See our website here:

### [248] [Language as Cost: Proactive Hazard Mapping using VLM for Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03138)
*Mintaek Oh,Chan Kim,Seung-Woo Seo,Seong-Woo Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出一种零样本语言成本映射框架，结合视觉语言模型和几何障碍地图，使机器人能预判动态风险并主动规划路径，实验证明其优于传统反应式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统依赖静态地图，难以应对动态风险（如突然开门的人），导致系统反应迟缓。论文旨在利用预训练的大型语言模型和视觉语言模型（VLMs）实现主动危险规避。

Method: 论文提出了一种零样本语言作为成本映射框架，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）解释视觉场景、评估潜在动态风险，并预先分配风险感知导航成本。该方法将语言成本地图与几何障碍地图结合，实现机器人对潜在危险的预判和主动规划。

Result: 在模拟和多样化动态环境中的实验表明，该方法相比反应式基线规划器显著提高了导航成功率并减少了危险遭遇。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的零样本语言作为成本映射框架通过结合视觉语言模型和几何障碍地图，显著提高了机器人在动态环境中的导航成功率和减少危险遭遇。

Abstract: Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively
anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional
navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for
dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a
result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when
handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language
models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive
hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping
framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential
dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling
robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this
language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only
identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around
potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated
and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,
compared to reactive baseline planners. Code and supplementary materials are

TL;DR: CookBench是一个针对复杂烹饪场景的长时程规划新基准，通过高保真模拟和精细化动作设计挑战AI能力，并将开源以推动研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有具身规划基准多聚焦短时程任务和粗粒度动作，难以满足复杂物理世界中长时程任务需求，因此需开发新基准以填补这一空白。

Method: 研究提出CookBench基准，采用基于Unity的高保真模拟环境，定义两阶段任务（意图识别和具身交互），并细化动作粒度至空间操作层面，同时提供封装工具集支持统一API。

Result: 通过分析当前闭源大语言模型和视觉语言模型，揭示了它们在复杂长时程任务中的主要缺陷，为未来研究指明方向。

Conclusion: CookBench作为首个专注于复杂烹饪场景的长时程规划基准，通过高保真模拟环境和精细化动作设计，为前沿AI研究提供了挑战性平台。其开放源代码特性将促进未来研究发展。

Abstract: Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of
executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing
embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and
coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce
CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.
By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful
Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic
environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.
First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's
complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the
identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of
physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the
action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational
information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We
provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified
API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing
ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical
interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and
decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of
state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,
revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,
long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate
future research.

TL;DR: 提出FC-MPC和CBFs方法，结合DBSCAN和Kalman滤波，实现力顺应导航和障碍物避障，确保视觉障碍者在复杂环境中的安全和实时交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为视觉障碍者在复杂环境中提供实时双向交互和安全保障的导航辅助。

Method: 采用Force-Compliance Model Predictive Control (FC-MPC)和Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)进行力顺应导航和障碍物避障，结合Eight-Way Connected DBSCAN方法进行障碍物聚类，以及Kalman滤波预测障碍物轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，系统能够适应用户的力指令，同时在复杂环境中导航时保证用户和机器人的安全。

Conclusion: 该系统在复杂环境中成功实现了力顺应导航和障碍物避障，同时确保了用户和机器人的安全。

Abstract: Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time
two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model
Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for
force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots.
FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and
moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS)
method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User
CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and
dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility
issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected
DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from
O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on
resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum
Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman
filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates
force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental
results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while
guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物仿生的多功能抓取标注策略UniFucGrasp，建立了首个多手功能性抓取数据集UFG，实验验证其在功能操作和泛化能力上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有灵巧抓取数据集大多强调抓取稳定性，忽视了功能性抓取（如开瓶盖或握杯柄），且依赖昂贵、难控制的高自由度Shadow Hands。

Method: 基于生物仿生学，将人类自然动作映射到多种手部结构，并使用基于几何的力闭合来确保功能性和稳定的类人抓取。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生物启发的方式，实现了低成本、高效的多功能抓取数据集收集，并在实验中验证了其在功能操作精度和抓取稳定性上的提升，以及跨不同机械手的高效泛化能力。

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉和声纳数据的实时光声场景重建方法，适用于浑浊水域，实验证明其有效性并开源代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器人在浑浊水域中导航时，单目视觉重建方法不可靠且缺乏深度信息，而声纳虽适应浑浊水域但分辨率低且存在仰角模糊。结合两者的优势可提高场景重建的可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种实时光声场景重建方法，通过识别视觉数据中的感兴趣区域（而非点特征）并与声纳数据匹配，利用声纳的距离数据和相机的仰角数据进行重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同浑浊度条件下优于其他基于视觉或声纳的方法，并在码头环境中进行了实地测试验证。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种实时光声场景重建方法，特别适用于浑浊水域，通过结合视觉和声纳数据的优势，有效解决了传统方法的局限性。实验验证了该方法的有效性，并开源代码以促进社区参与。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots
navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based
reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale
information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting
conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This
work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is
specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to
identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of
interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to
corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data
from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental
comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying
turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source
to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement.

Motivation: 解决HJ可达性分析在实时应用中不可行的问题，同时确保安全性和计算效率。

Method: 利用学习基于方法近似时变安全集，通过神经残差网络和超网络参数化，实时估计值函数，并与HJ可达性分析结合。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，该方法比三种最先进方法提高了30%的成功率，同时保持相似的计算开销和低旅行时间解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的混合MPC局部规划器通过实时学习近似时变安全集，显著提高了成功率和解决方案质量，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort
and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A theatre-in-the-loop framework uses puppeteering to create expressive robot behaviors for performances, with initial success but noted mechanical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop expressive robot behaviors for artistic performance by leveraging theatrical methods, aiming to create coherent emotional arcs in robotic gestures.

Method: The method involves a director-guided puppeteering workflow where narrative objectives guide improvised robotic gestures, which are then captured and curated into reusable movement templates.

Result: Initial trials confirmed the framework's feasibility, showing its ability to sculpt robotic gestures into emotional arcs, though mechanical constraints of robots posed challenges.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the theatre-in-the-loop framework offers a viable model for interdisciplinary teams to develop socially expressive robot behaviors, bridging theatre and robotics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose theatre-in-the-loop, a framework for developing
expressive robot behaviours tailored to artistic performance through a
director-guided puppeteering workflow. Leveraging theatrical methods, we use
narrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic
gestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and
curated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone
playback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise
sculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing
challenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this
practice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating
socially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an
interactive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation
methodologies between humans and machines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机械臂操作主要针对小物体，但在工厂或家庭环境中常需移动大物体，如桌子，这通常需要多机器人系统协作。现有研究缺乏可扩展至任意机器人规模并能泛化至多种任务的框架。

Method: 使用SEEM进行场景分割和目标物体的点云提取，提出协作抓取框架，将任务分解为局部抓取姿态生成和全局协作，并设计了两阶段规划模块以生成无碰撞轨迹。

Result: 实验显示，CollaBot在不同机器人数量、物体和任务中的成功率为52%。

Conclusion: CollaBot框架在多种机器人数量、物体和任务中表现出52%的成功率，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: A central research topic in robotics is how to use this system to interact
with the physical world. Traditional manipulation tasks primarily focus on
small objects. However, in factory or home environments, there is often a need
for the movement of large objects, such as moving tables. These tasks typically
require multi-robot systems to work collaboratively. Previous research lacks a
framework that can scale to arbitrary sizes of robots and generalize to various
kinds of tasks. In this work, we propose CollaBot, a generalist framework for
simultaneous collaborative manipulation. First, we use SEEM for scene
segmentation and point cloud extraction of the target object. Then, we propose
a collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp
pose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning
module that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.
Experiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,
objects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The integration of Automated Delivery Robots (ADRs) into pedestrian-heavy
urban spaces introduces unique challenges in terms of safe, efficient, and
socially acceptable navigation. We develop the complete pipeline for a single
vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation,

sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and
depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance,
even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements,
including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7%
improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high
detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the
system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware
and inclusive robot behaviour.

Abstract: Vibration suppression is an important capability for collaborative robots
deployed in challenging environments such as construction sites. We study the
active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools.
We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to
learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We
propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive
step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our
logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and
enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation
experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and
real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show
that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original
BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions.
Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further
validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments. A

Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses,
dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time.
This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary
robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online
Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates
learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates
handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live
scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to
adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a
dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected
environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary
adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We
validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze
navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Accurate geospatial information is crucial for safe, autonomous Inland
Waterway Transport (IWT), as existing charts (IENC) lack real-time detail and
conventional LiDAR SLAM fails in waterway environments. These challenges lead
to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.
  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It
uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to
mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into
structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling
real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An
automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight,
IENC-compatible format.
  Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior
localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic
maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data
for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly
available

### [261] [AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736)
*Yusheng Zheng,Yanpeng Hu,Tong Yu,Andi Quinn*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: AgentSight是一个框架无关的AgentOps可观测性框架，通过边界追踪和eBPF技术，高效监控LLM代理，填补语义鸿沟，性能开销低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件基础设施越来越依赖LLM代理，但这些AI代理与传统确定性软件有本质区别，导致监控和调试面临挑战，现有工具无法关联高级意图和低级行为。

Method: AgentSight采用边界追踪技术，利用eBPF在稳定系统接口上监控代理，拦截TLS加密的LLM流量以提取语义意图，并通过实时引擎和次级LLM分析因果关联这些数据流。

Result: 评估显示，AgentSight能检测提示注入攻击、识别资源浪费的推理循环，并揭示多代理系统中的隐藏协调瓶颈，性能开销低于3%。

Conclusion: AgentSight作为一个开源项目发布，提供了一种有效的方法来监控和调试LLM代理，填补了传统工具在语义理解上的空白。

Abstract: Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for
development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these
AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing
a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates
a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level
intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but
cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to
distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures.
We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this
semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors
agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using
eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic
intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally
correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine
and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is
framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3%
performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection
attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden
coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an
open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.
