We\npresent Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a\nsingle expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel\nobject geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train\nclosed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and\ngeneralize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior\nwork using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert\ndemonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those\nworks, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as\nkeypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must\ntrack a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To\ngenerate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for\neach task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its\nassociated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint\nconfigurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the\ntransformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to\nthe first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and\nfour real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and\ntight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve\nan average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves\nan average of 50%."}

We assess the robustness of compressed versions of three widely used\nlanguage models for code across three software analytics tasks, using six\nevaluation metrics and four commonly used classical adversarial attacks. Our\nfindings indicate that compressed models generally maintain comparable\nperformance to their uncompressed counterparts. However, when subjected to\nadversarial attacks, compressed models exhibit significantly reduced\nrobustness.

Due to limitations in consensus mechanisms,\nespecially in managing node identities, blockchain is often considered\nunsuitable for applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper\nproposes the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain\nscalability and throughput. ADR employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nstructure where nodes are positioned based on their rankings.

The protocol follows a three-step\napproach to secure the network against double-spending and enhance performance.\nFirst, it verifies nodes using their public and private keys before granting\nentry. Second, it builds an advanced DAG ledger enabling block production and\ntransaction validation. Third, a ranking algorithm filters out malicious nodes,\nranks the remaining nodes based on performance, and arranges them\ntopologically. This process increases throughput and ensures robust\nscalability. We evaluated ADR on Amazon EC2 clusters with over 100 nodes,\nincluding scenarios with injected malicious nodes.

Despite the success of AI as a\nservice for multi-modal applications, it relies heavily on clouds, which are\nconstrained by bandwidth, latency, privacy concerns, and unavailability under\nnetwork or server failures. While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting\nmultiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To\naddress this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for\nmulti-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of\nmulti-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder,\nclassifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level\nmodules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby\nreducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module\nsharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel\nrouting by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a\ntestbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in\nsingle-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing\naccuracy.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy."}

Similar to prior\nwork using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert\ndemonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those\nworks, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as\nkeypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must\ntrack a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To\ngenerate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for\neach task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its\nassociated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint\nconfigurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the\ntransformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to\nthe first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and\nfour real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and\ntight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve\nan average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves\nan average of 50%."}

From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,\nour framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware\nDual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive\nFrequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise\nand optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial\ntexture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,\neffectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A\nhierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network\n(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,\nduring the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling\nmodules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color\nCalibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.\nThese modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color\nconsistency in the feature space.

Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that\nenables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.\nFurthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)\nsegmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual\nprompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative\ncapabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present\na unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its\nefficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.
