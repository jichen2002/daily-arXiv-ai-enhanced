### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual结合尺度关注和频率域修正，有效解决超高清图像恢复中的信息丢失和局部退化问题，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如下采样或纯频率域转换）在超高清图像恢复中存在信息丢失或局部退化处理不足的问题，RetinexDual旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: RetinexDual框架包含两个互补子网络：SAMBA（尺度关注机制）和FIA（频率域修正）。SAMBA负责反射分量修正，FIA则处理色彩和光照失真。

Result: 在去雨、去模糊、去雾和低光增强等任务中，RetinexDual在质量和量化指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual通过结合尺度关注和频率域修正，显著提升了超高清图像恢复任务的效果，并在多种任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ENTRep introduces a bilingual dataset and benchmarks for ENT endoscopy analysis, addressing gaps in automated classification and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is hindered by device and operator variability, subtle findings, and fine-grained distinctions, while existing benchmarks rarely support classification and retrieval needs.

Method: The paper introduces ENTRep, a dataset with expert-annotated images labeled for anatomical region and status, accompanied by bilingual narrative descriptions, and defines three benchmark tasks with standardized submission protocols.

Result: The dataset and benchmark tasks were evaluated using server-side scoring, with performance results from top-performing teams and an insightful discussion provided.

Conclusion: ENTRep establishes a comprehensive benchmark for ENT endoscopy analysis, integrating classification and retrieval tasks with bilingual clinical supervision, and provides valuable insights from top-performing teams.

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD是一种轻量级框架，通过整合多个自监督ViT的知识，显著提升了紧凑型学生网络的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自我监督学习方法通常孤立地预训练，忽略了互补性，导致模型体积庞大且难以部署。CoMAD旨在统一多个最先进自监督ViT的知识，以构建轻量级学生网络。

Method: CoMAD采用不对称掩码、线性适配器和层归一化、联合共识门控以及双级KL散度训练，从多个教师网络中蒸馏知识。

Result: CoMAD的ViT-Tiny在ImageNet-1K上达到75.4%的Top-1准确率，密集预测任务中在ADE20K和MS-COCO上也取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: CoMAD框架通过整合多个自监督视觉Transformer的知识，显著提升了紧凑型学生网络的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RADAR是一种基于注意力机制的扩散模型，直接生成异常图，解决了传统重建方法的计算和模式偏差问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于重建的扩散模型在异常检测中存在计算成本高、重建模式偏差和噪声水平选择困难等问题。

Method: RADAR（Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based diffusion models in Real-time）是一种基于注意力机制的扩散模型，直接生成异常图，避免了传统重建方法的计算开销和模式偏差问题。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和3D打印材料数据集上，RADAR在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数等关键指标上均优于现有方法，F1分数分别提升了7%和13%。

Conclusion: RADAR方法通过直接生成异常图，显著提升了异常检测的准确性和计算效率，超越了现有最先进的扩散模型和统计机器学习模型。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用事件摄像头和CNN_LSTM模型，本研究实现了约81%的准确率预测人眼中心位置，为VR/AR设备开发提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案，并建议未来通过LRP提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人眼运动速度极快（可达300°/秒），传统精确跟踪需要昂贵的高速摄像头，因此本研究旨在利用事件摄像头开发一种成本效益高且可解释的深度学习算法。

Method: 探索了多种方法，最终CNN_LSTM模型表现最佳。

Result: CNN_LSTM模型实现了约81%的准确率。

Conclusion: 本研究通过CNN_LSTM模型成功实现了约81%的准确率来预测人眼中心位置，并建议未来通过Layer-wise Relevance Propagation（LRP）进一步提升模型的可解释性和预测性能。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LuKAN模型结合KANs和Lucas多项式，有效平衡3D人体运动预测的精度与效率，实验表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D人体运动预测中难以平衡预测精度与计算效率，因此提出了基于KANs和Lucas多项式激活函数的LuKAN模型。

Method: 模型首先应用离散小波变换编码输入运动序列的时序信息，然后通过空间投影层捕捉关节间依赖关系。核心是采用Lucas多项式参数化的KAN层进行高效函数逼近，最后通过逆离散小波变换重构时间域的运动序列。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，LuKAN模型在定量和定性评估中均优于基线方法，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: LuKAN模型通过结合Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks和Lucas多项式激活函数，在3D人体运动预测任务中实现了预测精度与计算效率的平衡，并在多个基准数据集上展现了竞争力。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个新框架，用于评估MLLMs在识别和整合细微视觉线索以进行复杂推理的能力，揭示了当前模型在此类任务中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要分为两种类型：基本感知基准（缺乏深度推理）和主流推理基准（可能无法评估需要复杂分析的细微线索）。然而，深刻的视觉理解和复杂推理更依赖于对细微、不显眼的局部细节的解释，而非感知显著、宏观层面的对象。

Method: 引入VER-Bench框架，包含374个精心设计的问题，涵盖地理空间、时间、情境、意图、系统状态和符号推理等领域，每个问题均附带结构化证据（视觉线索和从线索中推导的问题相关推理）。

Result: VER-Bench评估了MLLMs在识别细粒度视觉线索（平均仅占图像面积的0.25%）和将这些线索与世界知识结合进行复杂推理方面的能力，揭示了模型在相关任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: VER-Bench揭示了当前模型在提取细微视觉证据和构建基于证据的论证方面的局限性，强调了增强模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理能力的重要性，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMM通过多模态查询和双流注意力机制，提升了Transformer-based检测器在遮挡和定位方面的性能，达到SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based目标检测器在遮挡、细粒度定位和计算效率方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的查询和注意力机制来提升性能。

Method: 提出了DAMM框架，结合了三种查询（基于视觉语言模型的外观查询、多边形嵌入的位置查询和随机学习查询）以及双流交叉注意力模块，分别优化语义和空间特征。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准测试中，DAMM在平均精度（AP）和召回率上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DAMM框架通过多模态查询和双流注意力机制，在遮挡、细粒度定位和计算效率方面显著提升了Transformer-based目标检测器的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的AP和召回率。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过精细分析仇恨视频的时间片段，揭示了视频级标注的标签噪声问题，并展示了时间感知模型的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线多媒体内容的快速增长加剧了仇恨言论的传播，而现有方法依赖的视频级标注忽略了仇恨内容的时间粒度，引入了大量标签噪声。

Method: 通过从HateMM和MultiHateClip数据集中修剪仇恨视频，利用标注时间戳来隔离明确的仇恨片段，并分析这些修剪片段中仇恨和非仇恨内容的分布与特征。

Result: 研究表明，时间戳噪声会改变模型的决策边界并削弱分类信心，凸显了仇恨言论表达的内在上下文依赖性和时间连续性。

Conclusion: 本文的研究揭示了粗粒度视频级标注在多模态仇恨视频检测中引入的标签噪声问题，强调了时间感知模型和基准的重要性，以提高模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [10] [Open-world Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation: A Human-in-the-loop Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04962)
*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOW-Seg是首个结合人类反馈的开放世界点云语义分割框架，通过原型构建和层次化消歧，显著提升分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放世界点云语义分割方法依赖资源密集型离线增量学习或密集标注支持数据的局限性。

Method: 构建直接基于查询数据的类原型，利用稀疏人类标注作为指导，引入层次化原型消歧机制，并通过密集条件随机场优化标签分配。

Result: 在稀疏标注（如每新类一次点击）下匹配或超越5-shot设置的GFS-Seg方法；使用高级骨干网络和更密集标注时，在S3DIS和ScanNetv2上分别达到85.27%和66.37% mIoU。

Conclusion: HOW-Seg通过结合人类反馈和层次化原型消歧机制，实现了高质量的基础和新类点云语义分割，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA通过测试时动态调整模型，结合辅助任务提升视频高光检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光检测方法因固定模型无法适应不同测试视频的独特特性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出了Highlight-TTA框架，结合辅助任务（跨模态幻觉）和主任务（高光检测），采用元辅助训练方案进行优化。

Result: 在三个先进模型和三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Highlight-TTA显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA框架通过测试时动态调整模型，显著提升了视频高光检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [12] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过校准令牌调制潜在嵌入，将FMDEs扩展到鱼眼图像，无需重新训练，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础单目深度估计器（FMDEs）在鱼眼图像上因相机校准参数变化导致的协变量偏移而表现不佳，需要一种无需重新训练或微调的适配方法。

Method: 提出了一种自监督方法，通过校准令牌调制潜在嵌入，将鱼眼图像的潜在嵌入分布与透视图像对齐，从而利用现有的大规模透视图像数据集。

Result: 在室内外多个场景中，该方法使用单一令牌集显著优于现有技术，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入校准令牌，成功将基础单目深度估计器扩展到鱼眼图像，无需重新训练或微调，显著提高了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法训练的前馈神经网络，在ImageNet 2012数据集上达到98.3%准确率，推测双标签问题是未达100%的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过新方法提升模型在ImageNet数据集上的准确率。

Method: 使用前馈人工神经网络，并采用[5]的新方法在ImageNet 2012竞赛数据集上进行训练。

Result: 模型达到了98.3%的准确率，99.69的Top-1率，并在10个批次分区中平均有285.9个完美分类的标签。最佳模型使用了322,430,160个参数，精度为4位小数。

Conclusion: 作者推测模型未能达到100%准确率的原因可能是数据集中的双标签问题，即存在重复图像但标签不同。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

TL;DR: ProMIM 是一个即插即用框架，通过掩码图像建模提升视觉语言模型的提示学习泛化能力，实验证明其高效且轻量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如 CLIP）在零样本学习中表现优异，但适应新任务时需要高资源训练；而提示学习技术（如 CoOp 和 CoCoOp）虽高效，但容易过拟合已知类别，泛化能力有限。

Method: ProMIM 采用简单的掩码策略生成实例条件提示，无缝增强现有方法（如 CoOp 和 CoCoOp）的鲁棒性，无需修改其核心架构。

Result: 实验表明，ProMIM 在零样本和小样本分类任务中显著提升了泛化性能，同时计算成本几乎可忽略。

Conclusion: ProMIM 通过集成掩码图像建模（MIM）到现有视觉语言模型（VLM）流程中，显著提升了条件提示学习的泛化能力，同时保持了计算效率，为实际应用提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WS-DSGG方法依赖外部对象检测器，但这些检测器在动态、关系感知场景中表现不佳，导致定位不准确和置信度低下。

Method: TRKT方法包含两个关键组件：关系感知知识挖掘（通过类别特定注意力图和帧间注意力增强策略）和双流融合模块（整合注意力图以优化对象定位和置信度）。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上的实验表明，TRKT实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRKT方法通过时间增强的关系感知知识转移，显著提升了弱监督动态场景图生成的性能，成为当前最先进的技术。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Method: AdvDINO是一个域对抗自监督学习框架，结合了梯度反转层和DINOv2架构，用于学习域不变特征。

Conclusion: AdvDINO通过整合梯度反转层到DINOv2架构中，有效促进了域不变特征学习，显著提升了模型在生物医学影像等领域的泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 解决现有3DGS方法在稀疏视图场景下因高斯等权渲染导致的过拟合问题，提升渲染质量和效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于学习不确定性的自适应加权方法，通过软微分dropout正则化优化高斯投影和混合过程。

Conclusion: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）通过自适应加权和不确定性学习，显著提升了稀疏视图场景下的渲染质量，减少了高斯数量的需求，并在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入可变尺寸的画布帧和可选择的画布帧率，显著提升了边缘平台上实时感知的性能，实现了更高的mAP和召回率。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

Motivation: 解决扩散图像压缩的两大问题：(1) 多步采样导致的解码延迟，(2) 生成性先验过度依赖导致的保真度差。

Method: 利用预训练的VAE模型生成信息丰富的潜在表示，并采用单步解码替代迭代去噪过程，同时引入保真度指导模块和速率退火训练策略。

Conclusion: SODEC显著优于现有方法，在速率-失真-感知性能上表现优越，解码速度比之前的扩散压缩模型提升20倍以上。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个新颖的深度补全框架，通过利用深度基础模型和创新的双空间传播方法，显著提升了在分布外（OOD）场景中的鲁棒性，无需大规模训练。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

Conclusion: 提出了一种统一的模态分离框架，有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了目标域性能，并在多种实验设置中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

TL;DR: 研究使用ViT自编码器探讨熟悉度训练如何诱导深度神经网络早期层对全局上下文的敏感性，发现快速权重架构可有效模拟大脑中的快速全局上下文学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期神经生理学研究显示，早期视觉皮层能够快速学习全局图像上下文，这归因于局部循环相互作用而非前馈或反馈通路的变化。本研究旨在从功能角度探讨熟悉度训练如何诱导深度神经网络早期层对全局上下文的敏感性。

Method: 本研究采用基于视觉变换器（ViT）的自编码器，从功能角度探讨熟悉度训练如何诱导深度神经网络早期层对全局上下文的敏感性。假设快速学习通过快速权重（编码瞬态或短期记忆痕迹）实现，并探索在每个变换器层中使用低秩适应（LoRA）实现此类快速权重。

Result: 结果显示：(1) 提出的基于ViT的自编码器的自注意力电路执行了类似于熟悉度效应的神经电路模型的流形变换；(2) 熟悉度训练使早期层的潜在表示与包含全局上下文信息的顶层对齐；(3) 熟悉度训练扩大了记忆图像上下文中的自注意力范围；(4) 这些效应通过基于LoRA的快速权重显著增强。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，熟悉度训练能够在分层网络的早期层引入全局敏感性，且混合快速和慢速权重架构可能为研究大脑中的快速全局上下文学习提供可行的计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

Conclusion: AG-ReID 框架通过结合整体和细粒度属性信息，显著提升了遮挡场景下的行人重识别性能，并在标准场景中保持竞争力。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频持续学习面临高内存需求挑战，尤其是长视频和持续流数据，需要一种既能减少存储又能保持学习性能的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于排演的方法，存储视频编码而非原始输入，并在线训练视频压缩器，同时提出视频编码刷新方案以应对灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700等大规模视频数据集上，CRAM以低于2GB的内存存储数千个长视频，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CRAM方法通过压缩视频存储和动态刷新视频编码，显著降低了内存需求，并在大规模视频持续学习任务中表现出色，超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Conclusion: MCDRL框架通过结合因果推断与视觉语言模型，有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域泛化问题，显著提升了分割准确性和模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

### [28] [A Novel Image Similarity Metric for Scene Composition Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05037)
*Md Redwanul Haque,Manzur Murshed,Manoranjan Paul,Tsz-Kwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCSSIM是一种无需训练的度量标准，通过统计方法量化生成AI图像的场景构图结构保持情况，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成AI模型的快速发展，现有的图像质量评估方法（如像素级方法和基于感知的指标）无法充分评估场景构图结构的保持情况，因此需要一种新的评估方法。

Method: SCSSIM通过利用从图像的立方体层次分区中导出的统计测量，量化SCS的保持情况，无需训练即可捕获非基于对象的结构关系。

Result: 实验表明，SCSSIM对非构图扭曲具有高度不变性，能准确反映未改变的SCS；而对构图扭曲则表现出强烈的单调递减，精确指示SCS的变化。

Conclusion: SCSSIM是一种新颖、无需训练的度量标准，能够有效评估生成AI模型中场景构图结构（SCS）的保持情况，为开发高质量生成模型提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频行人重识别方法常忽视从查询-图库对中识别和选择最具区分性特征的必要性，导致匹配效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的分层自适应生物特征专家混合（HAMoBE）框架，利用预训练大模型（如CLIP）的多层特征，模拟人类感知机制，独立建模关键生物特征（外观、静态体型和动态步态）并自适应整合。

Result: 在MEVID等基准测试中，HAMoBE显著提升了性能（如Rank-1准确率提升13.0%）。

Conclusion: HAMoBE框架通过分层和自适应地整合多生物特征专家，显著提升了视频行人重识别的性能，特别是在动态环境中。

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在文档理解任务中表现出色，但在复杂文档中定位和推理细粒度细节的能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出Spot-IT方法，通过智能补丁选择和高斯注意力增强MLLMs的能力，模拟人类在搜索文档时的缩放和聚焦行为。

Result: Spot-IT在复杂布局中提取精确细节的任务上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spot-IT方法在复杂布局中提取精确细节的场景中显著优于基线方法，展示了其在细粒度文档理解任务中的有效性。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

Motivation: 为了解决在复杂光照条件下从单张图像估计基于物理的渲染（PBR）材料的挑战，提出了 DualMat 框架。

Method: DualMat 采用双路径扩散框架，分别在反照率优化的 RGB 潜在空间和材料专用的紧凑潜在空间中进行操作，通过特征蒸馏确保预测的连贯性，并利用修正流提高效率。

Result: DualMat 在反照率估计和金属粗糙度预测上显著优于现有方法，并支持高分辨率和多视角输入。

Conclusion: DualMat 在 Objaverse 和真实世界数据上均实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法，在反照率估计上提升了28%，金属粗糙度预测误差减少了39%。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

Motivation: 现有的持续语义分割方法通常采用单阶段编码器-解码器架构，导致新旧类别学习之间的干扰和保留-可塑性平衡不佳。

Method: DecoupleCSS采用两阶段框架：第一阶段利用预训练的文本和图像编码器（通过LoRA调整）生成位置感知提示；第二阶段使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）生成精确的分割掩码，确保新旧类别的知识共享。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS通过解耦类感知检测和类无关分割，有效解决了持续语义分割中的灾难性遗忘问题，实现了保留与适应性的更好平衡，并在多种挑战性任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 通过分类和对抗学习探索自动图像着色，改进了现有方法，并进行了比较。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 GAN 和基于扩散的方法依赖复杂的损失函数或额外面部控制模块，容易引入错误，导致迁移效果不佳。

Method: 基于 FLUX-Kontext 框架，利用源图像作为原生条件输入，并引入轻量级的 RefLoRAInjector 化妆特征注入器，解耦参考路径与主干网络，高效提取化妆相关信息。同时设计了鲁棒且可扩展的数据生成流程。

Result: FLUX-Makeup 在多样场景中表现出强鲁棒性，实验证明其性能达到当前最优水平。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup 是一个高保真、身份一致且鲁棒的化妆迁移框架，无需任何辅助面部控制组件即可实现卓越的迁移效果。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 病理基础模型（PFMs）的多样化但不透明的预训练环境引入了潜在偏见，限制了其在下游应用中的通用性和透明度。

Method: AdaFusion是一种新颖的提示引导推理框架，通过轻量级注意力机制动态整合来自多个PFMs的互补知识，并压缩和对齐瓦片级特征。

Result: AdaFusion在三个真实世界基准测试中（包括治疗反应预测、肿瘤分级和空间基因表达推断）表现优于单个PFMs，并提供了模型生物语义专业化的可解释性见解。

Conclusion: AdaFusion成功整合了多种病理基础模型（PFMs）的互补知识，显著提升了在分类和回归任务中的性能，同时提供了模型特定归纳偏见的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成长视频时存在身份漂移和时序一致性不足的问题，需一种能精确控制身份和运动的方法。

Method: 采用 in-context LoRA 微调策略（令牌级外观注入和通道级姿态控制）及分段生成方法（共享 KV 缓存和过渡处理）。

Result: PoseGen 在身份保真度、姿态准确性和长视频生成能力上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PoseGen 通过创新的 in-context LoRA 微调策略和分段生成方法，成功解决了长视频生成中的身份漂移和时序一致性问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

TL;DR: SMP是一种新颖的FSCIL方法，通过MIAM和MPCC机制，策略性地整合边缘惩罚，平衡基础类可区分性和新类泛化性，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据隐私和高获取成本限制了增量任务中的训练数据量，导致类增量学习性能显著下降。现有方法难以平衡基础类可区分性和新类泛化性，且增量任务中原始数据访问受限导致类间决策边界模糊。

Method: SMP方法包括两个主要机制：基础任务学习中的Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging（MIAM）机制和增量任务中的Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration（MPCC）策略。MIAM训练两组低秩适配器，一组带有边缘惩罚以增强基础类可区分性，另一组不带边缘约束以促进对新类的泛化。MPCC则通过边缘惩罚微调分类器，优化决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200数据集上的广泛实验表明，SMP在FSCIL中实现了最先进的性能，同时更好地平衡了基础类和新类。

Conclusion: SMP方法通过在不同阶段策略性地整合边缘惩罚，成功解决了FSCIL中基础类可区分性和新类泛化性之间的平衡问题，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多实例学习（MIL）在处理千兆像素全切片图像（WSI）时的高推理成本问题，通过消除无关 patches 实现快速准确的分类。

Method: AHDMIL框架包含动态多实例网络（DMIN）和双分支轻量级实例预筛选网络（DB-LIPN），通过自蒸馏（SD）和非对称蒸馏（AD）两阶段训练，结合Chebyshev多项式基的Kolmogorov-Arnold（CKA）分类器提升性能。

Result: 在Camelyon16数据集上准确率提升5.3%，推理速度加快1.2倍；所有数据集的AUC、准确率、F1分数和Brier分数均显著提升，平均推理速度提升1.2至2.1倍。

Conclusion: AHDMIL框架通过两阶段训练过程显著提升了病理图像分类的准确性和推理速度，在多个公开数据集上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一文本输入，无法充分捕捉视觉细节，导致类似对象的误识别。通过多潜在表达补充缺失的视觉信息，提升定位准确性。

Method: 引入 subject distributor 和 visual concept injector 模块，结合 positive-margin 对比学习策略，生成多潜在表达以捕捉目标对象的独特视觉线索。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有 RIS 和 REC 方法，并在 GRES 基准上表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的新视觉 grounding 框架通过多潜在表达和对比学习策略，显著提升了在 RIS、REC 和 GRES 任务上的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Result: 在有限数据集场景下，FedGIN在MRI测试案例上的3D Dice得分比不带GIN的FL提高了12%至18%；在完整数据集场景下，FedGIN表现出接近集中式的性能，MRI-only基线提高了30%，CT-only基线提高了10%。

Conclusion: FedGIN框架通过结合轻量级的全局强度非线性增强模块，有效解决了多模态医学图像分割中的数据稀缺和隐私问题，表现出优异的跨模态泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Conclusion: X-MoGen 是一个统一的跨物种文本驱动运动生成框架，通过两阶段架构和形态一致性模块，显著提升了运动生成的合理性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Conclusion: PhysPatch 是一种针对基于 MLLM 的自动驾驶系统设计的物理可实现且可迁移的对抗性补丁框架，显著优于现有方法，并在物理可行区域中放置对抗性补丁，确保了强大的现实适用性和部署性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Conclusion: MTT框架通过整合灵活的轨迹片段生成和多轨迹片段关联，有效解决了未见类别目标跟踪中的挑战，如低置信度检测和长期遮挡，实验证明了其竞争力。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

Motivation: 解决内窥镜图像匹配中因视觉条件困难（如弱纹理、大视角变化）和标注数据稀缺带来的挑战。

Method: 提出了EndoMatcher，采用双分支Vision Transformer提取多尺度特征，并通过双交互块增强鲁棒性对应学习；构建了Endo-Mix6多域数据集，并采用渐进式多目标训练策略。

Result: 在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上，内点匹配数量分别提升了140.69%和201.43%，在Gastro-Matching数据集上MDPA提升了9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher通过大规模多域数据预训练和渐进式多目标训练策略，显著提升了内窥镜图像匹配的泛化能力，在多个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

Conclusion: VFlowOpt 是一种高效的视觉令牌修剪框架，能够在保持性能的同时显著减少计算成本。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Motivation: 由于数据隐私和传输成本的考虑，开发无需源域数据的跨域少样本分割方法变得至关重要。

Result: 在1-shot和5-shot设置下，该方法在四个跨域数据集上的平均分割精度分别提升了2.18%和4.11%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种无需源域数据的跨域少样本分割方法（CD-FSS），通过结合文本和视觉信息，显著提升了在目标域任务适应中的分割精度。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen 是一种基于扩散的新框架，能够从任意视角生成可控的相机图像，填补了自动驾驶领域在无真实数据视角下的图像生成空白。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional

capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在增强对抗鲁棒性的同时保持零样本泛化能力的内在权衡。

Method: 分析了两种主要防御范式：对抗微调（AFT）和训练无关/测试时防御，并追踪了从对齐保持方法到嵌入空间重构、从输入启发式到潜在空间净化的演变。

Result: 梳理了八篇开创性论文，总结了不同防御方法的演变及其优缺点。

Conclusion: 本报告总结了视觉语言模型（VLMs）零样本对抗鲁棒性的关键挑战与未来方向，包括混合防御策略和对抗预训练。

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial
pre-training.

Conclusion: RegionMed-CLIP 通过区域感知的对比预训练，显著提升了多模态医学图像理解的能力，为未来的研究和应用提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

Conclusion: 该研究总结了现有性别分类方法的优缺点，并指出了该领域的挑战和改进方向。

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Result: CF3方法仅需5%的高斯数量即可达到与Feature-3DGS相当的3D特征场效果。

Conclusion: CF3方法通过自上而下的流程和自适应稀疏化技术，显著减少了高斯数量（仅需5%），同时保持了几何细节，实现了高效且紧凑的3D高斯特征场表示。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

TL;DR: SGDFuse利用SAM的语义掩码引导条件扩散模型，实现高保真、语义感知的红外与可见光图像融合，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法由于缺乏对场景的深度语义理解，往往无法保留关键目标，同时融合过程可能引入伪影和细节丢失，严重影响图像质量和任务性能。

Method: SGDFuse采用两阶段流程：首先进行多模态特征的初步融合，然后利用SAM生成的语义掩码与初步融合图像作为条件，驱动扩散模型进行从粗到细的去噪生成。

Result: SGDFuse在主客观评估及下游任务适应性方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SGDFuse通过结合条件扩散模型和Segment Anything Model（SAM）的语义引导，成功实现了高保真和语义感知的图像融合，为下游视觉任务提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Conclusion: B4DL 提供了一个统一的解决方案，用于动态户外环境中的时空推理，通过结合数据集、基准和模型，首次实现了直接处理原始4D LiDAR数据的能力。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

Conclusion: WGDF方法通过结合小波变换和高低频特征增强模块，显著提升了遥感图像中边缘模糊区域的检测精度和鲁棒性，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: 传统PPAT解读依赖心理学家经验且耗时，因此需要一种自动化方法来支持大规模DPT。

Method: 提出了一个实验环境用于PPAT草图的自动化分析，并开发了一种基于LLM的视觉语义抑郁症评估方法（VS-LLM）。

Result: 实验结果表明，VS-LLM方法相比心理学家评估方法提升了17.6%的效果。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的VS-LLM方法在抑郁症评估中比心理学家评估方法提高了17.6%，为基于PPAT草图元素识别的心理状态评估研究做出了贡献。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Conclusion: CoCAViT是一种新颖的视觉骨干网络，专为鲁棒的实时视觉表示设计，通过CoCA机制和优化的架构选择，显著提升了小模型在OOD数据上的泛化性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

Motivation: 尽管大型预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）在目标检测任务中表现出色，但特定目标的优化仍需微调，而传统微调会丧失原始的自然语言查询和零样本能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于文本反转（Textual Inversion, TI）的开放词汇目标检测方法，通过仅学习新词或改进现有词嵌入，实现对新对象或细粒度对象的检测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种定量和定性实验中优于基线方法，且计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 该方法通过文本反转技术扩展了VLM的词汇表，成功保留了原始模型的零样本能力，并在计算资源需求上显著优于全模型微调。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Result: 实验表明，3DGabSplat在真实和合成场景中均优于3DGS及其变体，PSNR提升达1.35 dB，同时减少基元数量和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat通过引入3D Gabor基元和多方向频率响应，显著提升了3D场景的高频细节表示能力，同时减少了冗余基元和内存消耗，实现了渲染质量和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

Conclusion: PriorRG框架通过两阶段训练流程有效整合患者特定先验知识，显著提升了胸部X光报告生成的临床准确性和流畅性，在MIMIC-CXR和MIMIC-ABN数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc通过切片图像和几何验证提升跨视图定位的可靠性，显著减少定位误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视图定位方法缺乏冗余观测，难以验证定位可靠性。Slice-Loc通过生成冗余观测和引入可靠性验证机制，解决了这一问题。

Method: Slice-Loc采用两阶段方法：1)将查询图像分割为子图像并估计每个子图像的3-DoF位姿；2)使用几何刚性公式过滤错误位姿，合并内点生成最终相机位姿。此外，通过NFA模型量化定位的可靠性。

Result: Slice-Loc在DReSS数据集上，将平均定位误差从4.47米降至1.86米，方向误差从3.42°降至1.24°，错误超过10米的比例降至3%以下。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc通过切片图像生成冗余观测，结合几何刚性公式和NFA模型，显著提升了跨视图定位的准确性和可靠性，减少了定位误差和方向误差。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

Motivation: 当前方法主要依赖全局图像特征，忽略了细粒度器官关系对准确生成放射学报告的重要性。

Method: 提出CT-GRAPH，一种分层图注意力网络，通过解剖区域图建模放射学知识，结合预训练的3D医学特征编码器和大型语言模型生成报告。

Result: 在CT-RATE数据集上，F1分数比现有最佳方法绝对提升7.9%。

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH通过显式建模解剖关系，显著提升了CT报告生成的准确性和细粒度表现。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法难以捕捉组织结构的空间依赖性，而传统GNN依赖静态图拓扑且忽视物理空间位置，注意力机制也缺乏特异性。

Method: 构建了一个动态加权有向图，结合可学习空间偏移（基于真实坐标）的注意力机制，使模型能自适应关注形态相关区域。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（TCGA-COAD、BRACS、胃肠化生分级和肠道ROI分类）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的可变形注意力GNN框架在计算病理学中显著提升了WSIs和ROIs的分类性能，尤其在捕捉复杂空间结构方面表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型和掩码生成变换器在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但在组合生成（如属性绑定和文本-图像对齐）方面仍存在挑战。UNCAGE旨在解决这一问题，尤其是针对掩码生成变换器的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance (UNCAGE)的训练免费方法，该方法通过注意力图优先解掩代表单个对象的标记，以提升文本到图像生成的组合保真度。

Result: UNCAGE在多个基准测试和指标上均表现出色，显著提升了组合保真度，且推理开销极小。

Conclusion: UNCAGE是一种无需训练的新方法，通过利用注意力图优先解掩代表单个对象的标记，显著提升了组合保真度。该方法在多个基准和指标上均表现优异，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有的一阶显著性图无法捕捉视觉语言编码器中复杂的跨模态交互，因此需要一种更灵活、高效的第二阶解释方法。

Method: FIxLIP基于博弈论，使用加权Banzhaf交互指数分解视觉语言编码器的相似性，提高了计算效率。

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试中，FIxLIP表现优于一阶归因方法，并成功比较了不同模型（如CLIP与SigLIP-2）。

Conclusion: FIxLIP作为一种基于博弈论的方法，在视觉语言编码器中提供了高质量的第二阶交互解释，优于一阶归因方法，并在模型比较中展示了其实用性。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Conclusion: TrueBiometric 提供了一种更实用、准确且有效的解决方案，用于减轻人脸识别系统中的后门攻击，同时不影响干净图像的准确性。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

Conclusion: 揭示了测试时扩展和强化学习在GUI定位中的潜力，为高效稳健的GUI代理提供新方向。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the security risks posed by physical adversarial camouflage in safety-critical fields, particularly the challenges of inconsistent sampling densities and conflicting gradient updates in existing techniques.

Method: The method involves a gradient calibration strategy to ensure consistent updates across distances and a gradient decorrelation method to enhance optimization stability by prioritizing and orthogonalizing gradients.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, with an average increase in attack success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed adversarial camouflage framework significantly improves attack success rates across various conditions, highlighting the need for more robust system designs in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

Motivation: 解决Slot Attention（SA）在图像或视频首帧冷启动查询缺乏样本特异性，以及非首帧查询处理方式单一的问题。

Method: 提出SmoothSA，包括预热冷启动查询的微小模块和区分视频帧处理的策略（首帧完整迭代，非首帧单次迭代）。

Result: 在对象发现、识别及下游任务基准测试中表现优异，分析直观展示了方法如何平滑SA迭代和递归。

Conclusion: SmoothSA通过预热冷启动查询和区分视频帧间的处理方式，有效提升了对象中心学习（OCL）的性能，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

Motivation: 解决传统基于流的方法在模型表达能力上的局限性，并重新理解Flow Matching的潜力。

Method: 提出了时间反向Flow Matching (rFM) 作为向量场回归方法，使用Worst Transport (WT) 位移插值重构非概率演化路径，构建'退化势阱'来分离异常样本。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上实现了单尺度下的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Flow Matching (FM) 提供了一种计算上可行的框架，能够在复杂数据中实现无监督异常检测，并在MVTec数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Conclusion: F2PASeg 为垂体手术提供了一种实时、可靠的解剖结构分割解决方案，显著提升了手术安全性。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Motivation: 以往研究表明，通过有损压缩预处理图像可以防御对抗扰动，但缺乏全面的攻击评估。本研究旨在填补这一空白，探究压缩模型在对抗攻击中的表现。

Method: 构建了针对多种压缩模型的强白盒和自适应攻击，并通过多种攻击场景的严格评估，比较了高真实感和低真实感压缩模型的抗攻击能力。

Result: 研究发现，能够产生高真实感、高保真度重建的压缩模型对攻击具有显著抵抗力，而低真实感模型则容易被攻破。这种鲁棒性并非梯度掩蔽所致，而是与自然图像保持分布对齐的真实感重建的内在特性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了高保真度重建图像在对抗攻击中的固有鲁棒性，为未来对抗攻击研究提出了重要挑战，并指出提升攻击技术以克服真实感是全面安全评估的关键。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

TL;DR: 本研究提出MELLA数据集，通过双源策略增强MLLMs在低资源语言中的文化接地性和语言能力，实验证明性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言增强方法多限于文本模态或依赖机器翻译，忽略了多模态信息和文化接地性对低资源语言用户的重要性。

Method: 本研究提出了一种双源策略，分别针对文化接地性和语言能力收集数据，具体实现为MELLA多模态多语言数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，在MELLA上微调后，八种语言在各种MLLM骨干模型上的性能普遍提升，模型能够生成“厚描述”。

Conclusion: 本研究的结论是通过MELLA数据集微调后的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在低资源语言环境下表现显著提升，验证了文化知识和语言能力的双重增强效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测（IAD）对制造质量控制至关重要，但传统方法在不同应用场景下需要大量人工干预，因此需要更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: AutoIAD采用Manager-Driven中心智能体协调多个子智能体（包括数据准备、数据加载、模型设计、训练器）并结合领域知识库，实现从原始工业图像数据到训练完成的异常检测模型的端到端自动化开发。

Result: 实验表明，AutoIAD在MVTec AD数据集上的表现优于现有框架，尤其在任务完成率和AUROC指标上显著提升，并通过迭代优化有效减少了幻觉等问题。

Conclusion: AutoIAD通过多智能体协作框架显著提升了工业视觉异常检测的自动化开发效率和质量，尤其在任务完成率和模型性能（AUROC）上优于现有通用智能体协作框架和传统AutoML框架。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手性信息在形状分析中的普遍性以及当前形状描述符缺乏手性感知特征，开发一种手性特征提取器变得必要且紧迫。

Method: 基于Diff3F框架，提出了一种无监督的手性特征提取流程，利用2D基础模型为形状顶点添加手性感知信息。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的无监督手性特征提取方法在多个下游任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

*Shibo Wang,Haonan He,Maria Parelli,Christoph Gebhardt,Zicong Fan,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicHOI uses novel view synthesis diffusion models to improve hand-object reconstruction in limited visibility scenarios, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods either rely on object templates or assume full object visibility, which often fails in real-world settings with limited viewpoints and static grips.

Method: MagicHOI integrates a novel view synthesis model into the hand-object reconstruction framework and aligns hand to object using visible contact constraints.

Result: MagicHOI demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even under limited viewpoint variation.

Conclusion: MagicHOI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction methods by leveraging novel view synthesis diffusion models to regularize unseen object regions.

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据稀疏且噪声多，传统方法难以有效提取特征，因此需要一种自监督预训练框架来挖掘事件数据中的潜在信息。

Method: 框架包含三个阶段：Difference-guided Masked Modeling、Backbone-fixed Feature Transition和Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning，分别用于增强事件数据信息提取、特征对比和语义区分。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多个任务上优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的自监督预训练框架在多个下游任务中表现出色，包括物体识别、语义分割和光流估计，证明了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，行人跟踪面临严重的遮挡挑战，传统方法在遮挡场景下表现不佳，因此需要更鲁棒的特征表示和运动模型。

Method: 该方法融合了目标检测器的回归和分类分支的特征，并引入了头部关键点检测模型，同时采用迭代卡尔曼滤波方法进行运动建模。

Result: 提出的方法在拥挤环境中表现出更鲁棒的跟踪性能，尤其是在遮挡普遍的场景下。

Conclusion: 提出的增强跟踪框架通过结合更丰富的特征表示和更鲁棒的运动模型，显著提升了在遮挡严重场景下的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在特征空间施加噪声的认证防御方法，显著提升了图像质量评估模型的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在输入图像中直接注入高斯噪声会降低视觉质量，因此需要一种既能保持图像保真度又能提供鲁棒性保证的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于随机平滑的认证防御方法，通过在特征空间而非输入空间施加噪声，分析了骨干网络Jacobian的最大奇异值来连接特征空间与输入空间的扰动。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法在不认证时减少99.5%的推理时间，认证时减少20.6%，并在两个基准数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持图像保真度的同时提供了鲁棒性保证，显著提高了与主观质量评分的相关性，最高达30.9%。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

Method: 1. 引入Jacobian Criterion，一种一阶度量，用于评估结构参数的显著性，同时捕捉组件内和层间的依赖关系。2. 提出Equivalent Pruning机制，利用自动编码器在微调过程中保留所有原始连接（包括被剪枝的）的贡献。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Optimal Brain Connection框架通过Jacobian Criterion和Equivalent Pruning机制，有效解决了现有结构化剪枝方法忽视参数间相互连接的问题，显著提升了模型性能的保持能力。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

Conclusion: Action Discovery 提出了一种新颖的两步方法（GGSM 和 UASA），显著提升了在部分标注数据集中的动作分割性能，尤其是在处理已知和未知动作时。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLP模型在弱监督下难以实现细粒度定位，且未能充分利用结构化关系知识，限制了未见类别的性能。

Method: DART框架包含两个协同模块：自适应细化模块（ARM）用于类内细化，结合弱监督补丁选择（WPS）损失；自适应转移模块（ATM）利用LLM构建的类关系图（CRG）进行类间关系转移。

Result: DART在多个挑战性基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DART框架通过结合外部LLM衍生的关系知识和自适应类内细化，在OV-MLR任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art

TL;DR: WeTok通过GQ和GD技术，在视觉tokenizer中实现了压缩比与重建保真度的突破，性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉tokenizer在压缩比与重建保真度之间难以取得平衡，限制了视觉生成任务的效果。

Method: 1. Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ)：将潜在特征分组并进行无查找量化，克服了内存和计算限制，同时实现了更可扩展的码本。
2. Generative Decoding (GD)：引入带有额外噪声变量的生成解码器，概率建模视觉数据分布，提升了高压缩比下的细节重建能力。

Result: 在ImageNet 50k验证集上，WeTok取得了创纪录的低零样本rFID（0.12），并在最高压缩比768下实现了3.49的rFID，显著优于同类方法。

Conclusion: WeTok tokenizer通过其创新的Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ)和Generative Decoding (GD)技术，在视觉生成任务中实现了压缩比与重建保真度的优异平衡，显著超越了现有主流tokenizer的性能。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

*Tao Sun,Oliver Liu,JinJin Li,Lan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-RE是基于MLLM的框架，用于评估图像与文本的二进制相关性，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估图像与文本之间的相关性是衡量生成AI响应质量的关键，但由于文本格式多样且相关性定义因场景而异，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 采用LLaVA架构，结合详细任务指令和多模态上下文样本，构建了LLaVA-RE框架，并提出了一个新颖的二进制相关性数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLaVA-RE框架在图像-文本相关性评估任务中表现有效。

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE作为一种基于MLLM的评估框架，在图像-文本相关性评估任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: Uni-CoT是一个统一的链式思维框架，通过两级推理和结构化训练，实现了高效的多模态推理，性能优异且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉-语言推理任务中难以建模视觉状态转换或保持连贯的视觉轨迹，Uni-CoT旨在解决这些限制。

Method: Uni-CoT采用了两级推理范式：宏观级CoT用于任务规划，微观级CoT用于子任务执行，并结合了交错图像-文本监督和多任务目标的结构化训练范式。

Result: 在WISE、RISE和KRIS等基准测试中，Uni-CoT表现出SOTA性能和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT通过统一的链式思维框架，在单一模型中实现了连贯且基于视觉的多模态推理，展现了卓越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi3DEval是一个分层3D生成内容评估框架，结合对象和部分级评估，提升质量分析和材料真实性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D内容生成质量评估方法在空间一致性、材料真实性和局部细节捕捉上的局限性。

Method: 提出了Hi3DEval框架，包括分层评估、多代理标注管道和3D感知自动评分系统，利用视频表示和预训练3D特征。

Result: 实验表明，Hi3DEval在建模3D特性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于现有图像指标。

Conclusion: Hi3DEval 框架通过结合对象级和部分级评估，以及扩展的纹理评估，显著提升了3D生成内容的质量评估能力，并与人类偏好更一致。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

TL;DR: MOSEv2是一个更复杂的视频对象分割数据集，旨在推动真实场景研究。测试显示现有方法性能大幅下降，暴露了其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOS数据集（如DAVIS和YouTube-VOS）主要包含显著、主导且孤立的对象，限制了其在真实场景中的泛化能力。为了推动VOS在复杂环境中的研究，作者提出了更具挑战性的MOSEv2数据集。

Method: 通过构建包含5,024个视频和701,976个高质量掩码的MOSEv2数据集，引入了更复杂的场景（如对象消失/重现、严重遮挡、恶劣天气等），并在5种不同设置下对20种代表性VOS方法和9种视频对象跟踪方法进行了基准测试。

Result: 在MOSEv2上，现有方法性能显著下降（如SAM2从MOSEv1的76.4%降至50.9%），表明当前方法在真实世界复杂性面前仍存在不足。

Conclusion: MOSEv2数据集显著提升了视频对象分割（VOS）任务的复杂性，揭示了当前最先进方法在真实世界场景中的局限性，为进一步研究提供了更具挑战性的基准。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

TL;DR: GAP converts colorless 3D point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians using text-guided multi-view optimization, ensuring geometric accuracy and completing hard-to-observe regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of directly generating 3D Gaussians from colorless point clouds, which remains unsolved despite the advantages of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in rendering.

Method: GAP employs a multi-view optimization framework with a depth-aware image diffusion model, a surface-anchoring mechanism for geometric accuracy, and a diffuse-based inpainting strategy for hard-to-observe regions.

Result: GAP demonstrates high-fidelity 3D Gaussian generation from point clouds across synthetic, real-world scans, and large-scale scenes, validated by extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: GAP effectively bridges the gap between colorless 3D point clouds and high-fidelity 3D Gaussians, leveraging text guidance and multi-view optimization to achieve superior rendering quality and geometric accuracy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer 是一种可取消的人脸生成框架，通过混合潜在代码和设计多目标损失，在保持高识别准确率的同时增强隐私保护，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸匿名化方法通常只关注身份隐匿，而无法满足生物特征模板保护的要求（如可撤销性、不可链接性和不可逆性）。

Method: FaceAnonyMixer 利用预训练生成模型的潜在空间，通过混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，并设计多目标损失函数来满足可取消生物特征的所有要求。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FaceAnonyMixer 在提供显著更强的隐私保护的同时，实现了更高的识别准确率，相比最近的可取消生物特征方法，在商业 API 上实现了超过 11% 的提升。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer 提出了一种可取消的人脸生成框架，通过混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，实现了高质量的隐私保护人脸生成，并在保持高识别准确率的同时显著增强了隐私保护。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

Conclusion: The RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework significantly enhances THz-enabled industrial communications, achieving a 23% sum rate gain over fixed power allocation schemes.

Abstract: This paper presents a joint framework that integrates reconfigurable

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance smart industrial
communications. The proposed system leverages the advantages of RIS and THz
bands to improve spectral efficiency, coverage, and reliability key
requirements for industrial automation and real-time communications in future

performance further. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the sum
rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme
achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results

Abstract: This paper presents the concept, architectural design, and performance
evaluation of a 5G Mobile Cell (MC) used to provide 5G wireless connectivity to
User Equipment (UE) in areas with limited fixed 5G infrastructures or subject
to adverse radio conditions. We consider two main approaches to MC design: an
overlay model, where the MC obtains backhaul connectivity from a 5G overlay
network, and an Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB)-based model, discussing
their protocol stacks and architectural implications. In order to validate the
MC's performance, we employ an emulation-based testbed using the
OpenAirInterface (OAI) implementation, considering different MC positions. The
results validate the MC concept and demonstrate that MC positioning
significantly influences network performance. This paper has the potential to
aid network operators and service providers in selecting and deploying MC

*Thejas Radhika Sajith*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文改进了子集和问题的算法，提出了一种确定性算法和一种随机算法，分别在时间和空间复杂度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Jin等人提出的两个自然问题：是否存在$\tilde{O}(n+t)$时间且poly$(n, \log t)$空间的算法，以及是否能构建确定性多项式空间算法，其时间复杂度与Bellman的算法相当。

Method: 基于Jin等人提出的框架，采用多点评估方法加速其算法中的瓶颈步骤。

Result: 提出了两种算法：确定性算法和随机算法，分别在不同时间和空间复杂度上实现了改进。

Conclusion: 本文针对子集和问题提出了两种改进算法：一种确定性算法，时间复杂度为$\tilde{O}(nt)$，空间复杂度为$\tilde{O}(n \log^2 t)$；另一种随机算法，时间复杂度为$\tilde{O}(n+t)$，空间复杂度为$\tilde{O}(n^2 + n \log^2 t)$。

Abstract: Given a multiset $A = \{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ of positive integers and a target
integer $t$, the Subset Sum problem asks if there is a subset of $A$ that sums
to $t$. Bellman's [1957] classical dynamic programming algorithm runs in
$O(nt)$ time and $O(t)$ space. Since then, there have been multiple
improvements in both time and space complexity.
  Notably, Bringmann [SODA 2017] uses a two-step color-coding technique to
obtain a randomized algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time and
$\tilde{O}(t)$ space. On the other hand, there are polynomial space algorithms
-- for example, Jin, Vyas and Williams [SODA 2021] build upon the algorithm
given by Bringmann, using a clever algebraic trick first seen in Kane's
Logspace algorithm, to obtain an $\tilde{O}(nt)$ time and $\tilde{O}(\log(nt))$
space algorithm. A natural question, asked by Jin et al. is if there is an
$\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time algorithm running in poly$(n, \log t)$ space. Another
natural question is whether it is possible to construct a deterministic
polynomial space algorithm with time complexity comparable to that of
Bellman's.
  In this paper, we answer both questions affirmatively. We build on the
framework given by Jin et al., using a multipoint evaluation-based approach to
speed up a bottleneck step in their algorithm. We construct a deterministic
algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(nt)$ time and $\tilde{O}(n \log^2 t)$ space
and a randomized algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time and
$\tilde{O}(n^2 + n \log^2 t)$ space.

Motivation: Elmasry的论文声称其单源最短路径算法的时间复杂度为O~(m√n)，但这一结论存在疑问，因此需要验证其正确性。

Method: 通过构建一个特定的加权图实例，展示在该图上Elmasry算法的运行时间达到Ω(mn)，从而反驳原分析。

Result: 证明了Elmasry算法在特定加权图上的运行时间为Ω(mn)，否定了原论文的时间复杂度分析。

Conclusion: 该论文通过提供加权图的例子，证明了Elmasry提出的单源最短路径算法的时间复杂度分析是错误的，实际运行时间为Ω(mn)，而非声称的O~(m√n)。

Abstract: In this note we examine the recent paper "Breaking the Bellman-Ford
Shortest-Path Bound" by Amr Elmasry, where he presents an algorithm for the
single-source shortest path problem and claims that its running time complexity
is $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the
number of edges. We show that his analysis is incorrect, by providing an
example of a weighted graph on which the running time of his algorithm is
$\Omega(mn)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理独立编辑流或测试假设编辑时，现有方法无法高效支持瞬态编辑的模式匹配，因此需要设计新的数据结构和算法。

Method: 通过预处理文本和模式，设计支持瞬态子串插入、删除或替换的数据结构。对于文本索引，预处理时间为线性，模式预处理时间为O(m log log m)。对于模式匹配，预处理时间为线性，查询时间为最优。

Result: 文本索引方法支持瞬态编辑的模式匹配查询，预处理时间为线性，查询时间为O(log log n + Occ)。模式匹配方法同样支持瞬态编辑，查询时间为最优的O(Occ)。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种支持瞬态子串编辑的文本索引方法，能够在处理独立编辑流或测试假设编辑时高效进行模式匹配查询。同时，还介绍了模式匹配与瞬态编辑的结合方法，实现了最优时间复杂度。

Abstract: A sequence $e_0,e_1,\ldots$ of edit operations in a string $T$ is called
ephemeral if operation $e_i$ constructing string $T^i$, for all $i=2k$ with
$k\in\mathbb{N}$, is reverted by operation $e_{i+1}$ that reconstructs $T$.
Such a sequence arises when processing a stream of independent edits or testing
hypothetical edits.
  We introduce text indexing with ephemeral substring edits, a new version of
text indexing. Our goal is to design a data structure over a given text that
supports subsequent pattern matching queries with ephemeral substring
insertions, deletions, or substitutions in the text; we require insertions and
substitutions to be of constant length. In particular, we preprocess a text
$T=T[0\mathinner{.\,.} n)$ over an integer alphabet $\Sigma=[0,\sigma)$ with
$\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. Then, we can preprocess
any arbitrary pattern $P=P[0\mathinner{.\,.} m)$ given online in
$\mathcal{O}(m\log\log m)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(m)$ space and allow any
ephemeral sequence of edit operations in $T$. Before reverting the $i$th
operation, we report all Occ occurrences of $P$ in $T^i$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\log\log n + \text{Occ})$ time.
  We also introduce pattern matching with ephemeral edits. In particular, we
preprocess two strings $T$ and $P$, each of length at most $n$, over an integer
alphabet $\Sigma=[0,\sigma)$ with $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ in
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. Then, we allow any ephemeral sequence of edit operations
in $T$. Before reverting the $i$th operation, we report all Occ occurrences of
$P$ in $T^i$ in the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\text{Occ})$ time. Along our way to
this result, we also give an optimal solution for pattern matching with
ephemeral block deletions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种内存高效的Hierholzer算法变体，仅需O(n lg m)位空间，适用于密集图或多重图，且保持线性时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Hierholzer算法实现需要O(m lg n)位空间，对于密集图或多重图内存消耗较大，因此需要一种更高效的空间优化算法。

Method: 描述了一种简化版的Hierholzer算法，通过避免使用O(m)大小的顶点栈或为每条边存储信息，实现了线性时间复杂度和更低的内存占用。

Result: 新算法在保持线性时间复杂度的同时，将工作空间降至O(n lg m)位，且易于实现。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种改进的Hierholzer算法变体，显著降低了工作空间需求，仅需O(n lg m)位内存，适用于密集图或多重图。

Abstract: We describe a simple variant of Hierholzer's algorithm that finds an Eulerian
cycle in a (multi)graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges using $\mathrm{O}(n \lg
m)$ bits of working memory. This substantially improves the working space
compared to standard implementations of Hierholzer's algorithm, which use
$\mathrm{O}(m \lg n)$ bits of space. Our algorithm runs in linear time, like
the classical versions, but avoids an $\mathrm{O}(m)$-size stack of vertices or
storing information for each edge. To our knowledge, this is the first
linear-time algorithm to achieve this space bound, and the method is very easy
to implement. The correctness argument, by contrast, is surprisingly subtle; we
give a detailed formal proof. The space savings are particularly relevant for
dense graphs or multigraphs with large edge multiplicities.

Method: 通过移除冗余集中的边将图转换为生成树，针对无向和有向版本分别设计了时间复杂度为O(n² log n · 2^{k log k})和O(n² · 2^{4k-3})的算法。

Result: 无向版本的算法时间复杂度为O(n² log n · 2^{k log k})，有向版本更高效，为O(n² · 2^{4k-3})。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了针对无向和有向版本的生成树同构问题的固定参数可解算法，参数化为冗余集的大小k。

Abstract: In this paper, we present fixed-parameter tractability algorithms for both
the undirected and directed versions of the Spanning Tree Isomorphism Problem,
parameterized by the size $k$ of a redundant set. A redundant set is a
collection of edges whose removal transforms the graph into a spanning tree.
For the undirected version, our algorithm achieves a time complexity of $O(n^2
\log n \cdot 2^{k \log k})$. For the directed version, we propose a more
efficient algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n^2 \cdot 2^{4k-3})$, where
$n$ is the number of vertices.

Abstract: Graph clustering is an important algorithmic technique for analysing massive
graphs, and has been widely applied in many research fields of data science.
While the objective of most graph clustering algorithms is to find a vertex set
of low conductance, a sequence of recent studies highlights the importance of
the inter-connection between vertex sets when analysing real-world datasets.
Following this line of research, in this work we study bipartite-like clusters
and present efficient and online sparsification algorithms that find such
clusters in both undirected graphs and directed ones. We conduct experimental
studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that our algorithms
significantly speedup the running time of existing clustering algorithms while
preserving their effectiveness.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 研究了Isometric Path Partition问题在树宽参数下的复杂性，证明其W[1]-难，并提供了动态规划算法。时间复杂度和硬度结果扩展了对树宽参数局限性的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Isometric Path Partition问题在参数化为树宽时的复杂性，解答了Dumas等人和Fernau等人的问题，并验证了参数化方法的局限性。

Method: 通过动态规划算法，时间复杂度为n^O(tw)和diam^O(tw^2) * n^O(1)。

Result: 证明了Isometric Path Partition是W[1]-难的，并提供了时间复杂度较高的算法，同时排除了更高效算法的可能性。

Conclusion: 本文证明了Isometric Path Partition问题在参数化为树宽时是W[1]-难的，并通过设计动态规划算法提供了解决方案，尽管其时间复杂度较高。

Abstract: We investigate the parameterized complexity of the Isometric Path Partition
problem when parameterized by the treewidth ($\mathrm{tw}$) of the input graph,
arguably one of the most widely studied parameters. Courcelle's theorem shows
that graph problems that are expressible as MSO formulas of constant size admit
FPT algorithms parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. This
encompasses many natural graph problems. However, many metric-based graph
problems, where the solution is defined using some metric-based property of the
graph (often the distance) are not expressible as MSO formulas of constant
size. These types of problems, Isometric Path Partition being one of them,
require individual attention and often draw the boundary for the success story
of parameterization by treewidth.
  In this paper, we prove that Isometric Path Partition is $W[1]$-hard when
parameterized by treewidth (in fact, even pathwidth), answering the question by
Dumas et al. [SIDMA, 2024], Fernau et al. [CIAC, 2023], and confirming the
aforementioned tendency. We complement this hardness result by designing a
tailored dynamic programming algorithm running in $n^{O(\mathrm{tw})}$ time.
This dynamic programming approach also results in an algorithm running in time
$\textrm{diam}^{O(\mathrm{tw}^2)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\textrm{diam}$ is the
diameter of the graph. Note that the dependency on treewidth is unusually high,
as most problems admit algorithms running in time $2^{O(\mathrm{tw})}\cdot
n^{O(1)}$ or $2^{O(\mathrm{tw} \log (\mathrm{tw}))}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. However, we
rule out the possibility of a significantly faster algorithm by proving that
Isometric Path Partition does not admit an algorithm running in time
$\textrm{diam}^{o(\mathrm{tw}^2/(\log^3(\mathrm{tw})))} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, unless
the Randomized-ETH fails.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文改进了CARP的近似算法，首次超越1993年的结果，达到了$(\frac{5}{2}-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-近似比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CARP是运筹学中的一个重要弧路径问题，自1981年提出以来，其近似算法的改进一直是一个开放问题。本文旨在突破Jansen在1993年提出的近似比。

Method: 基于最近在CVRP近似算法上的进展，作者提出了一种改进的近似算法。

Result: 提出的算法达到了$(\frac{5}{2}-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-近似比，是首次超越Jansen的成果。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的近似算法，将CARP的近似比从Jansen的$\frac{5}{2}-\frac{1.5}{k}$提升至$\frac{5}{2}-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$，这是自1993年以来的首次改进。

Abstract: The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), introduced by Golden and Wong in
1981, is an important arc routing problem in Operations Research, which
generalizes the famous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). When every
customer has a unit demand, the best known approximation ratio for CARP, given
by Jansen in 1993, remains $\frac{5}{2}-\frac{1.5}{k}$, where $k$ denotes the
vehicle capacity. Based on recent progress in approximating CVRP, we improve
this result by proposing a
$(\frac{5}{2}-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-approximation algorithm, which to
the best of our knowledge constitutes the first improvement over Jansen's
bound.

*Mayra Sofia Ruiz Rodriguez,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究评估GPT-4o mini在ML项目中文件级别日志生成的潜力，发现其位置匹配率63.91%，但过度记录率82.66%，并揭示了文件级别日志的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在文件级别生成日志语句的潜力，尤其是在机器学习应用中，以增强系统可靠性。

Method: 研究收集了171个ML仓库中的4,073个Python文件，移除原始日志后，使用GPT-4o mini生成日志，并评估日志位置、级别、变量及文本质量，同时手动分析生成日志的常见模式和挑战。

Result: LLM在63.91%的情况下与人类在相同位置引入日志，但过度记录率高达82.66%。手动分析揭示了文件级别日志的挑战，如函数开头或结尾的过度记录、大代码块中记录的困难以及与项目特定日志惯例的不一致。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM在生成完整文件的日志方面显示出潜力，但仍存在过度记录、在大代码块中记录困难以及与项目特定日志惯例不一致等限制，需要进一步解决以实现实际应用。

Abstract: Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor
system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of
large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers
are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work
focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log
generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications,
where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate
the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML
projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing
4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed
the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,
and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text
quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we
manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common
patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place
as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of
82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level
logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,
difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with
project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for
generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed
for practical implementation.

TL;DR: 提出一种自动化流程，通过关键帧提取和视觉-语言模型匹配，快速定位游戏视频中的错误帧，显著提升审核效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决游戏开发中因大量错误报告和视频审核带来的高人力成本、低效率及难以扩展的问题。

Method: 使用FFmpeg提取关键帧，并通过视觉-语言模型（GPT-4o）评估和排序关键帧，选择与错误描述最匹配的帧。

Result: 在真实游戏开发环境中，该方法在Top-1检索帧上的F1得分为0.79，准确率为0.89，不同错误类别的表现有所差异。

Conclusion: 通过自动化流程将游戏视频中的关键帧提取并与错误描述匹配，显著减少了手动审核的工作量，提高了错误分类和回归检查的效率。

Abstract: Modern game studios deliver new builds and patches at a rapid pace,
generating thousands of bug reports, many of which embed gameplay videos. To
verify and triage these bug reports, developers must watch the submitted
videos. This manual review is labour-intensive, slow, and hard to scale. In
this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a
single frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers
instant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug.
  Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video
to a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug
moments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a
vision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match
the textual bug description and selects the most representative frame. We
evaluated this approach using real-world developer-submitted gameplay videos
and JIRA bug reports from a popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. The
pipeline achieves an overall F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the
top-1 retrieved frame. Performance is highest for the Lighting & Shadow (F1 =
0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories, and
lowest for Animation & VFX (0.51).
  By replacing video viewing with an immediately informative image, our
approach dramatically reduces manual effort and speeds up triage and regression
checks, offering practical benefits to quality assurance (QA) teams and
developers across the game industry.

Abstract: Open Source Software communities face a wave of uncertainty as Generative AI
rapidly transforms how software is created, maintained, and governed. Without
clear frameworks, communities risk being overwhelmed by the complexity and
ambiguity introduced by GenAI, threatening the collaborative ethos that
underpins OSS. We conduct a scenario-driven, conceptual exploration using a
socio-technical framework inspired by McLuhan's Tetrad to surface both risks
and opportunities for community resilience amid GenAI-driven disruption of OSS
development across four domains: software practices, documentation, community
engagement, and governance. By adopting this lens, OSS leaders and researchers
can proactively shape the future of their ecosystems, rather than simply
reacting to technological upheaval.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering
systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major
economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical
outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention
weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault
taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by
attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable
diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work
is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96
projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack
Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven
attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results
show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to
attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations
of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root
cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that
explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic
diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.

Abstract: We find ourselves in the midst of an explosion in artificial intelligence
research, particularly with large language models (LLMs). These models have
diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine,
and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust
body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks
through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP
remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited
understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and
code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work
aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key
stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced
programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows
where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we
propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately
enhancing the programming experience.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型软件系统中变更依赖管理的挑战，提出两个ML模型以半自动化方式识别依赖关系，显著提升了依赖识别的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件系统的复杂性增加，准确识别和管理变更之间的依赖关系变得至关重要，尤其是在多团队协作的大型系统中。

Method: 研究采用了初步调查OpenStack系统中的依赖管理情况，并开发了两个机器学习模型：一个用于预测变更间依赖的可能性，另一个用于识别具体的依赖变更对。

Result: 研究结果显示，OpenStack中51.08%的依赖关系是在代码审查阶段发现的，而非变更创建时。提出的两个模型表现良好，AUC分数分别为79.33%和91.89%，Brier分数为0.11和0.014。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种半自动化的方法，通过两个机器学习模型帮助开发者主动识别软件变更之间的依赖关系，从而提升CI/CD管道的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing
dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a
change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.
Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate
changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature
deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple
components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.
They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing
configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like
documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary
study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our
study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over
the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these
dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay
of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often
spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a
median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify
dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML
models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes,
while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed
models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33%
and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the
second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k
precision has room for improvement.

Method: LadyBug连接到Android应用的GitHub仓库，通过开发者上传的bug复现轨迹和原始bug描述，生成可能包含bug的文件排名列表。

Result: 在包含80个可复现bug报告的基准测试中，LadyBug优于基于文本检索的基线方法，UI信息的利用显著提高了定位准确性。

Conclusion: LadyBug通过结合UI交互信息和文本检索，显著提高了Android应用bug定位的准确性，并开源了工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces LadyBug, a GitHub bot that automatically localizes bugs
for Android apps by combining UI interaction information with text retrieval.
LadyBug connects to an Android app's GitHub repository, and is triggered when a
bug is reported in the corresponding issue tracker. Developers can then record
a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace
to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both
the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the
reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the
project that most likely contain the reported bug.
  We empirically evaluated LadyBug using an automated testing pipeline and
benchmark called RedWing that contains 80 fully-localized and reproducible bug
reports from 39 Android apps. Our results illustrate that LadyBug outperforms
text-retrieval-based baselines and that the utilization of UI information leads
to a substantial increase in localization accuracy. LadyBug is an open-source
tool, available at https://github.com/LadyBugML/ladybug.

Motivation: 当前基于测试结果的强化学习忽视了中间推理过程的质量，而直接监督推理过程易导致奖励攻击。

Method: 1. 开发了LCB-RB基准测试，包含优质和劣质推理过程的偏好对；2. 提出了基于优化-退化（OD-based）的奖励模型训练方法；3. 引入了后验-GRPO（P-GRPO）强化学习方法，选择性奖励成功结果的推理过程。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个统一框架，通过结合推理过程的质量来改进强化学习在代码生成中的应用，并展示了其在代码生成和数学任务中的通用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for
large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based
rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning
process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising
direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model
learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.
To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively
incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable
reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference
pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score
reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method
for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs
by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along
curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical
rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other
benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method
that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying
rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO
effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning
with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior
performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only
baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further
demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to
mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多领域仍缺乏标准化模型，且创建这些模型对非专业人士存在显著障碍。

Method: 提出了一种混合方法，结合大型语言模型（LLMs）与确定性技术，支持基于用户自然语言输入的JSON Schema创建、修改和模式映射。

Result: 开发了开源工具MetaConfigurator，支持可视化模型编辑、验证、代码生成和表单生成，并通过LLMs从异构数据生成模式映射。

Conclusion: 通过结合自然语言交互与确定性保障措施，本研究显著降低了非专业人士在结构化数据建模和数据集成方面的门槛。

Abstract: Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models at the core of system and data
engineering processes. In the context of research data, these models are
typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of
datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating
them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a
hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic
techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping
based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated
into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model
editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data
integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and
YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through
deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our
work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By
combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work
significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data
integration for non-experts.

Motivation: 现有主流基准如HumanEval和MBPP主要评估功能正确性，而推理基准如CRUXEVAL仅限于单函数、低复杂度场景，导致高级模型的分数接近饱和，限制了其区分能力。

Method: 提出了STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench（SX-Bench），一个专注于复杂多函数理解和细粒度执行推理的新基准，结合程序合成、符号执行和LLM辅助验证的自动化流程。

Result: 在超过20个主流模型上的评估显示，SX-Bench具有高度区分性：即使在最先进的OpenAI-O3模型上，Hard-Reasoning任务的准确率也仅为78.37%，远低于其在以往基准上的饱和分数。

Conclusion: SX-Bench通过将代码评估从‘单函数验证’推进到‘多函数动态推理’，为深入评估高级代码智能模型提供了关键工具。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress

scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores,
limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present
STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex
multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench
features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g.,
chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and
data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution
unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning
tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution
beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including
14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly
discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent
accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on
previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained
reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis,
symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation
and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function
verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for
the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.

### [122] [EvoGraph: Hybrid Directed Graph Evolution toward Software 3.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05199)
*Igor Costa,Christopher Baran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EvoGraph 是一个通过类型化有向图和专门小语言模型实现软件系统自我演化的框架，显著提升了安全漏洞修复、代码转换效率和文档更新速度，同时大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统现代化方法中的隐含契约、性能保持和集成演进等实证失败模式。

Method: EvoGraph 使用类型化有向图表示工件，应用由专门的小语言模型（SLMs）驱动的学习变异操作符，并通过多目标适应性选择幸存者。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，EvoGraph 修复了83%的已知安全漏洞，将COBOL转换为Java的功能等效性达到93%（测试验证），并将文档新鲜度保持在两分钟内。实验显示，与强基线相比，延迟减少了40%，功能交付时间减少了七倍。

Conclusion: EvoGraph 的设计为软件系统的持续自适应提供了一条实用路径，同时保持可测量的控制，标志着软件3.0时代的到来。

Abstract: We introduce **EvoGraph**, a framework that enables software systems to
evolve their own source code, build pipelines, documentation, and tickets.
EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned
mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and
selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph
fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93%
functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness
within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold
drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our
approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing
.NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96%
semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90%
compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical
failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance
preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path
toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under
measurable control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管业务流程管理（BPM）中的可持续性研究已有所涉及，但大多局限于环境维度。为实现更全面的可持续性影响，需要系统性地考虑其他维度。

Method: 研究提出了一个概念模型和结构化方法，用于分析物联网如何支持业务流程的可持续性，并通过旅游和医疗领域的案例进行了验证。

Result: 通过概念模型和方法论，研究展示了物联网如何支持业务流程的可持续性提升，并通过实际案例验证了其可行性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个概念模型和结构化方法，旨在通过物联网技术全面分析和提升业务流程的可持续性，超越了传统仅关注环境维度的局限性。

Abstract: The real-time data collection and automation capabilities offered by the
Internet of Things (IoT) are revolutionizing and transforming Business
Processes (BPs) into IoT-enhanced BPs, showing high potential for improving
sustainability. Although already studied in Business Process Management (BPM),
sustainability research has primarily focused on environmental concerns.
However, achieving a holistic and lasting impact requires a systematic approach
to address sustainability beyond the environmental dimension. This work
proposes a conceptual model and a structured methodology with the goal of
analyzing the potential of IoT to measure and improve the sustainability of
BPs. The conceptual model formally represents key sustainability concepts,
linking BPM and IoT by highlighting how IoT devices support and contribute to
sustainability. The methodology guides the systematic analysis of existing BPs,
identifies opportunities, and implements sustainability-aware, IoT-enhanced
BPs. The approach is illustrated through a running example from the tourism
domain and a case study in healthcare.

TL;DR: LLMs在文档到代码追溯中表现优异，但需注意错误模式和任务框架设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在自动化文档到代码追溯中的潜力，填补当前研究的空白。

Method: 通过系统实验评估LLMs在三个关键能力上的表现：追溯链接识别准确性、关系解释质量和多步链重建能力。

Result: 最佳LLM在两个数据集上的F1分数分别为79.4%和80.4%，显著优于基线方法（TF-IDF、BM25和CodeBERT）。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出强大的文档到代码追溯能力，但存在局限性，需结合人工干预和未来研究改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating
documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain
underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5
Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various
software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source
code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog
and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key
capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship
explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that
the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two
datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and
CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to
71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections
are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy
but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that
many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or
overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing,
such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These
findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their
limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight
specific error patterns for future research.

TL;DR: 研究了六种LLMs在解决真实Python问题时推荐的库，发现它们偏好第三方库，但存在可用性差距，如部分库无法自动解析且安装指导不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开发者越来越多地依赖大型语言模型（LLMs）协助编程任务，理解这些模型如何推荐库变得至关重要。

Method: 通过从Stack Overflow获取真实世界的Python问题，对六种最先进的LLMs（包括专有和开源模型）进行实证研究，分析它们推荐的库类型、库的特性以及推荐是否开箱即用。

Result: 结果显示LLMs更倾向于推荐第三方库而非标准库，且通常推荐成熟、流行和宽松许可的依赖项。然而，4.6%的库因导入名称与可安装包之间的结构不匹配而无法自动解析，且仅有两种模型提供了安装指导。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了对开发者和研究者的可操作见解，并指出了在软件依赖背景下提高LLM生成代码可靠性和可用性的机会。

Abstract: Software libraries are central to the functionality, security, and
maintainability of modern code. As developers increasingly turn to Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assist with programming tasks, understanding how
these models recommend libraries is essential. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical study of six state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-source,
by prompting them to solve real-world Python problems sourced from Stack
Overflow. We analyze the types of libraries they import, the characteristics of
those libraries, and the extent to which the recommendations are usable out of
the box. Our results show that LLMs predominantly favour third-party libraries
over standard ones, and often recommend mature, popular, and permissively
licensed dependencies. However, we also identify gaps in usability: 4.6% of the
libraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches
between import names and installable packages, and only two models (out of six)
provided installation guidance. While the generated code is technically valid,
the lack of contextual support places the burden of manually resolving
dependencies on the user. Our findings offer actionable insights for both
developers and researchers, and highlight opportunities to improve the
reliability and usability of LLM-generated code in the context of software
dependencies.

TL;DR: OPTIMUMP2P是一种基于RLNC的新型gossip算法，显著提升了libp2p在P2P网络中的信息传播效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的gossip算法（如floodsup和gossibsup）在性能和可靠性方面存在不足，尤其在区块链协议中传播块和交易时。

Method: 提出了一种新的gossip算法OPTIMUMP2P，利用RLNC技术来加速P2P网络中的信息传播，并确保可靠传输。

Result: 在模拟和实际环境中的评估显示，OPTIMUMP2P在性能上优于Gossipsub协议。

Conclusion: OPTIMUMP2P通过引入随机线性网络编码（RLNC）显著提高了libp2p的性能和可靠性，特别是在对抗恶意行为时。

Abstract: Gossip algorithms are pivotal in the dissemination of information within
decentralized systems. Consequently, numerous gossip libraries have been
developed and widely utilized especially in blockchain protocols for the
propagation of blocks and transactions. A well-established library is libp2p,
which provides two gossip algorithms: floodsup and gossibsup. These algorithms
enable the delivery of published messages to a set of peers. In this work we
aim to enhance the performance and reliability of libp2p by introducing
OPTIMUMP2P, a novel gossip algorithm that leverages the capabilities of Random
Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to expedite the dissemination of information in a
peer-to-peer (P2P) network while ensuring reliable delivery, even in the
presence of malicious actors capable of corrupting the transmitted data.
Preliminary research from the Ethereum Foundation has demonstrated the use of
RLNC in the significant improvement in the block propagation time [14]. Here we
present extensive evaluation results both in simulation and real-world
environments that demonstrate the performance gains of OPTIMUMP2P over the
Gossipsub protocol.

Motivation: 研究两种具有不同通信能力的自主机器人如何协作捕获移动目标，探讨非对称通信模型（Sender/Receiver）对线性搜索效率的影响。

Method: 设计新的线性搜索算法，考虑机器人对搜索环境的不同了解情况（如目标的起始距离、速度、移动模型等），并分析捕获目标所需时间的竞争比。

Result: 针对不同的搜索环境场景（目标的起始距离、速度、移动模型等），提出了新的线性搜索算法，并分析了其竞争比。

Conclusion: 本研究通过设计新的线性搜索算法，分析了不同通信能力机器人捕获移动目标的竞争比，为理解非对称通信对线性搜索效率的影响提供了贡献。

Abstract: We consider linear search for capturing an oblivious moving target by two
autonomous robots with different communicating abilities. Both robots can
communicate Face-to-Face (F2F) when co-located but in addition one robot is a
Sender (can also send messages wirelessly) and the other also a Receiver (can
also receive messages wirelessly). This is known as Sender/Receiver (S/R, for
short) communication model. The robots can move with max speed $1$. The moving
target starts at distance $d$ from the origin and can move either with speed
$v<1$ away from the origin in the ``away'' model or with speed $v \geq 0$
toward the origin in the ``toward'' model. We assume that the direction of
motion of the target (i.e., whether it is the away or toward model) is known to
the robots in advance. To capture the target the two robots must be co-located
with it.
  We design new linear search algorithms and analyze the competitive ratio of
the time required to capture the target. The approach takes into account
various scenarios related to what the robots know about the search environment
(e.g., starting distance or speed of the mobile, away or toward model, or a
combination thereof). Our study contributes to understanding how asymmetric
communication affects the competitive ratio of linear search.

TL;DR: Tesserae 通过图匹配优化 GPU 集群调度，显著提升作业完成时间和资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习训练在数据中心成为主导工作负载，现有调度器的放置策略要么性能次优，要么可扩展性差。

Method: 将放置约束建模为图匹配问题，并设计新的放置策略以减少作业迁移开销和提高作业打包效率。

Result: Tesserae 相比现有调度器，平均作业完成时间（JCT）提升高达 1.62 倍，总完成时间（Makespan）提升高达 1.15 倍。

Conclusion: Tesserae 的设计通过将放置约束转化为图匹配问题，显著提升了 GPU 集群调度器的效率和可扩展性，实验结果显示其性能优于现有调度器。

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models has become a dominant workload in
data-centers and improving resource utilization is a key goal of DL cluster
schedulers. In order to do this, schedulers typically incorporate placement
policies that govern where jobs are placed on the cluster. Existing placement
policies are either designed as ad-hoc heuristics or incorporated as
constraints within a complex optimization problem and thus either suffer from
suboptimal performance or poor scalability. Our key insight is that many
placement constraints can be formulated as graph matching problems and based on
that we design novel placement policies for minimizing job migration overheads
and job packing. We integrate these policies into Tesserae and describe how our
design leads to a scalable and effective GPU cluster scheduler. Our
experimental results show that Tesserae improves average JCT by up to 1.62x and
the Makespan by up to 1.15x compared with the existing schedulers.

Abstract: High-order solvers for compressible flows are vital in scientific
applications. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a key technique for reducing
computational cost by concentrating resolution in regions of interest. In this
work, we develop an AMR-based numerical solver using Regent, a high-level
programming language for the Legion programming model. We address several
challenges associated with implementing AMR in Regent. These include dynamic
data structures for patch refinement/coarsening, mesh validity enforcement, and
reducing task launch overhead via task fusion. Experimental results show that
task fusion achieves 18x speedup, while automated GPU kernel generation via
simple annotations yields 9.7x speedup for the targeted kernel. We demonstrate
our approach through simulations of two canonical compressible flow problems
governed by the Euler equations.

Abstract: Online analytical processing of queries on datasets in the many-terabyte
range is only possible with costly distributed computing systems. To decrease
the cost and increase the throughput, systems can leverage accelerators such as
GPUs, which are now ubiquitous in the compute infrastructure. This introduces
many challenges, the majority of which are related to when, where, and how to
best move data around the system. We present Theseus -- a production-ready
enterprise-scale distributed accelerator-native query engine designed to
balance data movement, memory utilization, and computation in an
accelerator-based system context. Specialized asynchronous control mechanisms
are tightly coupled to the hardware resources for the purpose of network
communication, data pre-loading, data spilling across memories and storage, and
GPU compute tasks. The memory subsystem contains a mechanism for fixed-size
page-locked host memory allocations to increase throughput and reduce memory
fragmentation. For the TPC-H benchmarks at scale factors ranging from 1k to 30k
on cloud infrastructure, Theseus outperforms Databricks Photon by up to
$4\times$ at cost parity. Theseus is capable of processing all queries of the
TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarks at scale factor 100k (100 TB scale) with as few as
2 DGX A100 640GB nodes.

Abstract: The growing demand for large-scale GPU clusters in distributed model training
presents a significant barrier to innovation, particularly in model
optimization, performance tuning, and system-level enhancements. To address
this challenge, LLM training simulators are employed to estimate training time
and guide design decisions. However, the state-of-the-art LLM training
simulators assume homogeneous compute and network infrastructure. In practice,
device heterogeneity is inevitable due to resource sharing in cloud
environments, frequent shifts in device generations, and inherent intra-chip
interconnect heterogeneity. To address the gap between state-of-the-art and
practical requirements, we propose the design of a heterogeneity-aware
distributed LLM simulator capable of predicting training time while enabling
abstractions to specify custom configurations for device groups and
device-to-parallelism mapping. We present the design requirements and
challenges in building a heterogeneity-aware distributed ML training simulator,
and design components such as non-uniform workload partitioning. Our initial
simulation results demonstrate the impact of heterogeneity on the model
computation and communication time.

Motivation: 现有下载工具通常采用静态并发设置，无法适应动态网络条件，导致带宽利用效率低下和下载时间延长。

Method: FastBioDL将下载过程建模为一个在线优化问题，利用效用函数和梯度下降实时动态调整并发套接字流的数量。

Result: 在公共基因组数据集上的综合评估显示，FastBioDL比现有工具快达4倍，在高速网络实验中，其自适应设计比现有工具快达2.1倍。

Conclusion: FastBioDL通过智能优化客户端标准的HTTP或FTP下载，为大规模基因组数据获取提供了一个稳健且高效的解决方案，使研究人员无需依赖专业商业软件或协议即可实现高性能数据检索。

Abstract: Modern next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects routinely generate terabytes
of data, which researchers commonly download from public repositories such as
SRA or ENA. Existing download tools often employ static concurrency settings,
leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization and prolonged download times due
to their inability to adapt to dynamic network conditions. We introduce
FastBioDL, a parallel file downloader designed for large biological datasets,
featuring an adaptive concurrency controller. FastBioDL frames the download
process as an online optimization problem, utilizing a utility function and
gradient descent to adjust the number of concurrent socket streams in real-time
dynamically. This approach maximizes download throughput while minimizing
resource overhead. Comprehensive evaluations on public genomic datasets
demonstrate that FastBioDL achieves up to $4x$ speedup over state-of-the-art
tools. Moreover, in high-speed network experiments, its adaptive design was up
to $2.1x$ faster than existing tools. By intelligently optimizing standard HTTP
or FTP downloads on the client side, FastBioDL provides a robust and efficient
solution for large-scale genomic data acquisition, democratizing
high-performance data retrieval for researchers without requiring specialized
commercial software or protocols.

Conclusion: AutoMDT通过其模块化设计和深度强化学习代理，显著提高了数据传输的效率和稳定性，相比现有解决方案，实现了更快的收敛和更短的数据传输完成时间。

Abstract: High-performance applications necessitate rapid and dependable transfer of
massive datasets across geographically dispersed locations. Traditional file
transfer tools often suffer from resource underutilization and instability
because of fixed configurations or monolithic optimization methods. We propose
AutoMDT, a novel modular data transfer architecture that employs a deep
reinforcement learning based agent to simultaneously optimize concurrency
levels for read, network, and write operations. Our solution incorporates a
lightweight network-system simulator, enabling offline training of a Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in approximately 45 minutes on average, thereby
overcoming the impracticality of lengthy online training in production
networks. AutoMDT's modular design decouples I/O and network tasks, allowing
the agent to capture complex buffer dynamics precisely and to adapt quickly to
changing system and network conditions. Evaluations on production-grade
testbeds show that AutoMDT achieves up to 8x faster convergence and a 68%
reduction in transfer completion times compared with state-of-the-art

Method: 研究创建了两个不同的测试设置：一个用于突出和隔离情感机器人表达的反应元素，另一个用于研究在机器人与人类物理接触时应用特定时间延迟的效果。第一个测试与两组人类观察者（n=84）进行，第二个测试与110名参与者进行，每十名参与者增加反应延迟时间。

Result: 结果显示，当机器人对与人类观察者共享的事件做出反应时，而非随机反应时，感知到的情感影响发生了统计学上的显著变化（p<0.05）。对于共享的物理互动，机器人接近人类的反应时间最适合该场景。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，对于小型非人形机器人，约200毫秒的延迟时间可能对人类观察者产生最大影响。若目标是让人类观察者感觉他们对机器人产生了最大影响，则约100毫秒的稍短反应时间最为有效。

Abstract: In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

TL;DR: HCMR算法通过分层循环合并调节优化多机器人路径规划，显著提升效率并确保无冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在已知环境中同时覆盖线性特征和调查区域的高效、无冲突路径规划问题。

Method: 采用分层循环合并调节（HCMR）算法，结合莫尔斯理论分析流形附着过程，通过循环合并搜索和边序列反向传播生成最优路径序列。

Result: 模拟结果显示，HCMR算法相比其他先进规划方法，路径长度至少减少10.0%，任务时间平均减少16.9%，且保证无冲突操作。

Conclusion: HCMR算法在固定扫描方向下被证明是最优的，显著提升了多机器人路径规划的效率，减少了任务时间，并确保了无冲突操作。

Abstract: The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDPG算法在迷宫导航任务中因稀疏奖励、低效探索和长时程规划问题表现不佳，导致成功率和平均奖励较低。

Method: 提出了一种高效的层次化DDPG（HDDPG）算法，包含高层和低层策略。高层策略生成中间子目标，低层策略生成原始动作。通过离线策略校正、自适应参数空间噪声、改进的奖励函数以及梯度裁剪和Xavier初始化等技术优化算法。

Conclusion: HDDPG算法显著提升了迷宫导航任务的性能，相较于基线算法，成功率和平均奖励分别提高了至少56.59%和519.03。

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

Motivation: 实现仅基于自然语言描述的未知环境视觉导航是智能机器人的关键能力，现有方法依赖被动视觉输入，无法有效解决视觉语言接地问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于现成视觉语言模型（VLMs）的导航框架，结合了两种人类启发的机制：基于视角的主动接地和历史记忆回溯。

Result: 在Habitat-Matterport 3D（HM3D）上的实验表明，该方法在语言驱动的物体导航中优于现有技术，并在四足机器人上实现了鲁棒的导航性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过主动优化感知和利用历史记忆来解决视觉语言接地问题，在复杂未知环境中显著提升了性能，并成功在现实世界中部署，展示了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Visual navigation in unknown environments based solely on natural language
descriptions is a key capability for intelligent robots. In this work, we
propose a navigation framework built upon off-the-shelf Visual Language Models
(VLMs), enhanced with two human-inspired mechanisms: perspective-based active
grounding, which dynamically adjusts the robot's viewpoint for improved visual
inspection, and historical memory backtracking, which enables the system to
retain and re-evaluate uncertain observations over time. Unlike existing
approaches that passively rely on incidental visual inputs, our method actively
optimizes perception and leverages memory to resolve ambiguity, significantly
improving vision-language grounding in complex, unseen environments. Our
framework operates in a zero-shot manner, achieving strong generalization to
diverse and open-ended language descriptions without requiring labeled data or
model fine-tuning. Experimental results on Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in language-driven
object navigation. We further demonstrate its practicality through real-world
deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving robust and effective navigation
performance.

Result: 研究详细分析了各快捷方法的优缺点，并提出了两种组合策略以实现最佳性能-运行时权衡。

Conclusion: 本研究通过全面比较现有的多机械臂轨迹快捷方法，提出了两种简单策略以优化性能与运行时间的平衡。

Abstract: Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each
shortcutting method and propose two simple strategies for combining these
methods to achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code, and
dataset are available at https://philip-huang.github.io/mr-shortcut/.

Abstract: External collisions to robot actuators typically pose risks to grasping
circular objects. This work presents a vision-based sensing module capable of
detecting collisions to maintain stable grasping with a soft gripper system.
The system employs an eye-in-palm camera with a broad field of view to
simultaneously monitor the motion of fingers and the grasped object.
Furthermore, we have developed a collision-rich grasping strategy to ensure the
stability and security of the entire dynamic grasping process. A physical soft
gripper was manufactured and affixed to a collaborative robotic arm to evaluate
the performance of the collision detection mechanism. An experiment regarding
testing the response time of the mechanism confirmed the system has the
capability to react to the collision instantaneously. A dodging test was
conducted to demonstrate the gripper can detect the direction and scale of
external collisions precisely.

with congruent or incongruent gaze. Arm trajectories were stopped at 60\% or
80\% of their full length, and participants predicted the final target. We
tested the multimodal superiority and ocular primacy hypotheses, both of which
were supported by the experiment.

Motivation: 自驱动实验室（SDLs）因机器人移动和锂电池使用增加了火灾等安全风险，需提升对危险和人员安全的实时监控能力。

Method: 系统整合了RGB、深度和红外摄像头工作站，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）进行决策，实时监控危险（如火灾、PPE合规性）并控制机器人避障。

Result: 测试显示，Chemist Eye对安全危害的识别和决策性能分别达到97%和95%。

Conclusion: Chemist Eye系统通过分布式安全监控和视觉语言模型驱动的决策，显著提升了自驱动实验室（SDLs）的安全性，能够有效识别潜在危险并实时响应。

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

Motivation: 机器人服装操作（如双手抚平）的类别级泛化由于高维度、复杂动态和类别内变化而面临挑战。现有方法容易过拟合或无法预测双手协同动作的价值。

Method: 提出Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net)，基于3D点云，利用预训练的静态几何特征增强类别级策略泛化。下游可训练组件学习任务特定策略。

Result: 在模拟实验中，FCBV-Net表现出优于基线的类别级泛化能力，效率下降仅11.5%（基线为96.2%），最终覆盖率达89%（基线为83%）。

Conclusion: FCBV-Net通过将几何理解与双手动作价值学习解耦，实现了更好的类别级泛化能力。

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of 18 children's in-the-wild experiences
with the autonomous robot arm performer NED (Never-Ending Dancer) within the
Thingamabobas installation, showcased across the UK. We detail NED's design,

installation. Our observational analysis revealed three key challenges in
child-robot interactions: 1) Initiating and maintaining engagement, 2) Lack of
robot expressivity and reciprocity, and 3) Unmet expectations. Our findings
show that children are naturally curious, and adept at interacting with a
robotic art performer. However, our observations emphasise the critical need to
optimise human-robot interaction (HRI) systems through careful consideration of
audience's capabilities, perceptions, and expectations, within the performative

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language

human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or
large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of

agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's
literature.

Conclusion: GhostShell 是一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）实现流式并行行为编程的新方法，在机器人原型 COCO 上通过 34 个真实世界交互任务的实验验证，其行为正确性指标达到 0.85（Claude-4 Sonnet），响应速度比原生 LLM 函数调用 API 快 66 倍。该方法在长时程多模态任务中表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We present GhostShell, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied
systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action
sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act
on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from
the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic
function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates
intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,
thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic
components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot
prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world
interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4
Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function
calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal
tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: GF-VLA框架通过信息论场景图和语言条件转换器，使双臂机器人直接从人类演示中学习任务级推理和执行，实现了高泛化能力和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统低级别轨迹模仿在物体类型、空间布局和操纵器配置上的泛化能力不足问题。

Method: GF-VLA首先提取基于香农信息的任务相关手和物体线索，编码为时间有序场景图，融合语言条件转换器生成分层行为树和可解释的笛卡尔运动命令，并引入跨手选择策略优化执行效率。

Result: 在双臂块组装任务中，GF-VLA实现了95%的图准确率、93%的子任务分割率，执行时达到94%的抓取成功率、89%的放置准确率和90%的总体任务成功率。

Conclusion: GF-VLA框架通过信息论场景表示和语言条件转换器，在双臂机器人任务中实现了高准确性和泛化能力，展示了在多样空间和语义变化下的强健性。

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to
the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过物理上下文信息优化社交机器人在人机交互中的行为适应能力。

Method: 框架包含两部分：表示遇到上下文的模块和通过人机交互学习行为优先级的模块，通过聚类物理属性和优化行为优先级进行训练。

Result: 在两种不同物理上下文中，通过72次交互和6名人类参与者测试，机器人成功自主学习了离散行为的优先级。

Conclusion: Affecta-context框架通过物理上下文信息指导机器人行为优化，展示了在未访问过的物理环境中泛化和匹配行为的能力。

Abstract: This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate
behavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the
physical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It
consists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that
learns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As
physical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured
physical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize
between behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior
in line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it
interacts with. This paper illlustrates the abilities of the Affecta-context
framework by enabling a robot to autonomously learn the prioritization of
discrete behaviors. This was achieved by training across 72 interactions in two
different physical contexts with 6 different human test participants. The paper
demonstrates the trained Affecta-context framework by verifying the robot's
ability to generalize over the input and to match its behaviors to a previously
unvisited physical context.

Motivation: 传统IEKF在联合优化相机姿态和地标时计算负担高，影响了其在多传感器融合中的效率和适用性。

Method: 提出了一种多视角仅姿态估计方法，并推导了一个视觉测量模型，直接关联地标表示与多相机姿态和观测。

Result: 该方法证明了地标与姿态之间的紧密耦合，并保持了独立于估计姿态的完美零空间。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在GVIO中展示了高效性和准确性，通过仿真和真实实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in
vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational
burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its
efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view
pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial
Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual
measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with
multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven
to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null
space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed
approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both
simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究发现，机器人通过情感表达（尤其是运动方式）能有效缓解高强度人机冲突，但关键在于社会情境感知而非特定表达方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在高强度人机对抗中，机器人如何通过情感表达来缓解冲突，并评估不同表达方式的优缺点。

Method: 研究采用定制的情感机器人在模拟冲突情境中进行实验，共105名参与者参与测试。通过五种不同的情感表达方式来评估每种方式在缓解冲突中的效果。

Result: 所有测试的情感表达方式均能成功缓解紧张局势并传递冲突认知。运动方式与其他方式存在显著差异（p<0.05），但参与者在情感解读上对机器人受影响程度的感知相似。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在高强度的人机对抗情境中，机器人通过表达悔意和承认冲突可以有效缓解紧张局势。不同情感表达方式均能成功传递冲突的认知，但运动方式表现尤为突出。更重要的是，机器人需要具备社会情境的感知能力，并据此做出反应，而非过分依赖特定的表达方式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the specific scenario of high-intensity
confrontations between humans and robots, to understand how robots can defuse
the conflict. It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective
expression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to
discover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the
hostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of
the situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the
conflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a
custom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test
participants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can
successfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of
the confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement
modality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test
participants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the
robot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates
that defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to
the expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the
abilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance
with it.

Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人操作任务中表现出色，但其推理时间长和需要执行动作块以保持一致性限制了其在延迟敏感任务中的应用。

Method: 受最优控制中的实时迭代方案启发，提出了一种扩展方法，有效处理机器人操作中的离散动作，如抓取。

Conclusion: 提出的基于实时迭代方案的新方法显著降低了推理时间，无需额外训练或策略重新设计，适用于资源密集型大型模型，并在保持性能的同时实现了高效推理。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

Conclusion: DistillDrive通过知识蒸馏和多样化实例模仿，显著提升了端到端自动驾驶模型的鲁棒性和决策能力，实验验证了其在减少碰撞率和闭环性能上的优越性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and

Abstract: Natural organisms use distributed actuation via their musculoskeletal systems
to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies to
perform varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to
mimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to
develop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,
such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the
ability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky
control systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for
designing and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing
distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines
3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight
actuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We
developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby
achieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,
which in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to
capitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:
one to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target
deformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits
to achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots
that show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to
their environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,
untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new
generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living
organisms.

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor
functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing
of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity.
Thus, we set out to answer whether the human hand, with its associated
biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we
should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands?
  This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand
complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the
human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic
hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are
capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement
for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is
missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?
  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for
robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist
flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation
capabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or
degrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise
between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two
opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase
dexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum.

Conclusion: MICoBot系统通过三层决策机制（元规划、任务分配和动作执行）有效提升了人机协作的任务成功率和用户体验，显著优于纯LLM基线和其他代理分配模型。

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

Conclusion: 通过自适应共形推断生成的预测不确定性估计，结合约束强化学习，本文提出的方法能够在分布偏移情况下实现安全且鲁棒的导航策略。

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are

Conclusion: Genie Envisioner (GE) 是一个集成了策略学习、评估和仿真的统一世界基础平台，为指令驱动的通用具身智能提供了可扩展且实用的基础。

Abstract: We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for
robotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and
simulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is
a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the
spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in
a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent
representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,
flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference
across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable
evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural
simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.
The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite

### [163] [Voost: A Unified and Scalable Diffusion Transformer for Bidirectional Virtual Try-On and Try-Off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04825)
*Seungyong Lee,Jeong-gi Kwak*

TL;DR: Voost 是一个联合学习虚拟试穿和试脱的框架，通过单一扩散变换器和推理技术提升服装-人体关系建模，实验结果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟试穿中服装与人体对应关系的准确建模是一个持续挑战，尤其在姿态和外观变化下。

Method: Voost 是一个统一的框架，通过单一扩散变换器联合学习虚拟试穿和试脱任务，支持灵活的生成方向和服装类别条件。此外，引入了注意力温度缩放和自校正采样两种推理技术。

Result: Voost 在试穿和试脱基准测试中均取得了最先进的结果，在对齐精度、视觉保真度和泛化能力上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Voost 通过联合学习虚拟试穿和试脱任务，利用单一扩散变换器实现了高效的服装-人体关系建模，无需特定任务网络或额外标签，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory
efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合显式-隐式函数的动态3DGS框架，解决了动态场景中运动细节与变形一致性的频谱冲突问题，通过谱感知编码、动态属性增强和自适应分割策略，显著提升了重建质量。

Method: 1. 谱感知拉普拉斯编码架构（结合哈希编码和拉普拉斯模块）；2. 增强的高斯动态属性；3. 基于KDTree的自适应高斯分割策略。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该方法在复杂动态场景重建中实现了更高的重建保真度，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 本文提出的混合显式-隐式函数动态3D高斯泼溅框架，通过谱感知拉普拉斯编码架构、增强的高斯动态属性和自适应高斯分割策略，显著提升了复杂动态场景的重建保真度，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the
scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges
and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding
using Gaussian Splatting.

Motivation: 现有方法因计算复杂度高无法满足实时部署需求，且在高度压缩的潜在空间中难以保留细粒度时空细节。

Method: RAP采用混合注意力机制进行精细音频控制，并结合静态-动态训练推理范式，避免显式运动监督。

Result: RAP在实时约束下实现了精确的音频驱动控制、减少了长期时间漂移，并保持了高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: RAP框架通过引入混合注意力机制和静态-动态训练推理范式，在实时约束下实现了高质量的音频驱动肖像动画，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

Method: 引入了一种基于高斯函数惯性体积的新密度控制方法，用于指导点基元的细化过程，并比较了传统结构从运动（SfM）和深度图像匹配（DIM）方法在点云初始化中的效果。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上的广泛实验表明，新方法在重建质量上超越了原始3DGS，并在多种场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的新密度控制方法通过利用高斯函数的惯性体积来指导细化过程，显著提升了3D高斯溅射（3DGS）的新视角合成质量，并在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上表现出优于原始3DGS的重建质量。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across
diverse scenes.

Motivation: 现有算法在绘制Reeb图时忽略或违反了三个关键属性，导致可视化结果不能忠实反映数据拓扑结构。

Method: 引入了一种称为GASP的算法，该算法考虑了Reeb图可视化时应遵循的三个属性：边界约束、紧凑性和函数梯度对齐。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估，GASP算法生成的Reeb图在Topology ToolKit (TTK)中表现优于几何重心算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的GASP算法能够生成更忠实反映底层数据的Reeb图可视化，相比现有算法有显著改进。

Abstract: Reeb graphs are an important tool for abstracting and representing the
topological structure of a function defined on a manifold. We have identified
three properties for faithfully representing Reeb graphs in a visualization.
Namely, they should be constrained to the boundary, compact, and aligned with
the function gradient. Existing algorithms for drawing Reeb graphs are agnostic
to or violate these properties. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to
generate Reeb graph visualizations, called \textit{GASP}, that is cognizant of
these properties, thereby producing visualizations that are more representative
of the underlying data. To demonstrate the improvements, the resulting Reeb
graphs are evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively against the
geometric barycenter algorithm, using its implementation available in the
Topology ToolKit (TTK), a widely adopted tool for calculating and visualizing
Reeb graphs.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的3D点云分割范式，能够同时将3D点关联到不同层，有效解决了衣物层重叠问题。通过实验验证了该范式在合成和真实扫描数据集上的优势。

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法将传统渲染的物理精确性与神经渲染的逼真外观相结合，为野外图像重照明提供了完全可控的解决方案，显著提升了3D计算机图形工具在现实场景中的应用。

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

Conclusion: 该研究通过集成LLM的智能系统，成功填补了状态监测与可操作维护计划之间的空白，为工业维护提供了智能决策支持，并推动了LLM在工业维护中的应用。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Motivation: 现有基准测试大多在理想化场景下评估大语言模型的推理能力，忽略了非理想场景下的性能，而人类推理在输入不完美时仍可靠，因此需研究非理想场景下的模型表现。

Method: 通过强化学习（特别是策略梯度算法）微调三个大型语言模型（LLM）和一个先进的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM），并在八个公共数据集上测试其性能。

Result: RL微调在理想场景下提升了基线推理能力，但在三种非理想场景（摘要推理、细粒度噪声抑制和上下文过滤）中性能显著下降。虽然提出了针对性修复方法，但当前方法未能完全解决推理缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前强化学习微调方法在非理想场景下表现显著下降，暴露了大模型推理能力的局限性，强调了在非理想场景下评估模型的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

Conclusion: This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于游戏理论的分子对接框架LoopPlay，通过交替训练配体和蛋白质口袋对接模块，显著提升了对接准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接的多任务学习模型在配体对接方面表现不佳，主要由于配体和蛋白质的结构复杂性差异。

Method: 提出了一个基于游戏理论的新框架Docking Game，并开发了Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay)算法，通过内外循环交替训练配体和蛋白质口袋对接模块。

Result: 在公共基准数据集上的实验显示，LoopPlay比现有最先进方法在预测准确结合模式上提高了约10%。

Conclusion: LoopPlay框架通过游戏理论方法显著提升了分子对接的准确性，特别是在配体对接方面，比现有方法提高了约10%。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

TL;DR: LLMs在空间数据集成中展现出潜力，通过减少对空间推理的依赖和采用审查与精炼方法，能够有效处理异构和噪声数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的集成方法无法覆盖所有边缘情况，而机器学习方法需要大量任务特定样本的收集和标注。

Method: 研究首先探讨了LLMs如何通过人类经验中介的环境空间关系进行推理，随后采用了一种审查与精炼方法。

Result: 当提供相关特征以减少对空间推理的依赖时，LLMs能够生成高性能结果。审查与精炼方法在纠正初始错误响应方面非常有效。

Conclusion: LLMs展现出作为传统基于规则启发式方法的灵活替代方案的潜力，推动了自适应空间数据集成能力的发展。

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Web导航领域的自主代理方法通常只关注离线模仿学习或在线探索，缺乏两种范式的有效整合，亟需一种统一视角来弥合离线学习与在线规划能力之间的鸿沟。

Method: 受人类认知双过程理论启发，将Web代理分解为快速的System 1和慢速的System 2认知过程，并实现为模块化架构CogniWeb，根据任务复杂度自适应切换两种模式。

Result: 在WebArena上的评估显示，CogniWeb实现了43.96%的成功率，同时显著提升了效率（令牌使用量减少75%）。

Conclusion: CogniWeb通过整合快速直觉处理（System 1）和深思熟虑推理（System 2），在Web导航任务中实现了高效且竞争性的性能，显著降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

Conclusion: MedMKEB作为首个全面的多模态医学知识编辑基准，将推动可信赖且高效的医学知识编辑算法的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟电路设计耗时且依赖经验，现有AI方法通用性差且依赖大模型，难以跨技术节点移植。

Method: 基于微调的Qwen3-8B模型，结合全局差分进化（DE）和局部粒子群优化（PSO）的启发式搜索，动态构建任务特定损失函数。

Result: EasySize在多个技术节点上表现优异，优于AutoCkt，并在86.67%的任务中节省了96.67%的仿真资源。

Conclusion: EasySize通过其轻量级框架和动态任务特定损失函数，显著减少了人工依赖和计算资源需求，加速了模拟电路设计过程，并计划开源。

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Conclusion: 本研究通过实证数据和概念框架，为融合人类与AI协作及教学对齐的混合学习生态系统提供了贡献。

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Motivation: 现实世界中的事件日志常因手动活动记录或数据收集问题而存在信息缺失，现有方法（如基于过程模型或机器学习）在修复所有事件属性方面存在局限。

Method: 开发了一种异构图神经网络模型，用于处理包含不完整事件的轨迹，并恢复这些事件中缺失的所有属性。通过两个合成日志和四个真实事件日志，在不同类型的缺失值情况下进行了评估。

Result: 所提出的方法在重建所有不同事件属性方面表现出色，优于现有的无模型方法，后者主要专注于修复部分事件属性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于异构图神经网络（Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network）的模型，用于修复过程挖掘中事件日志的缺失属性，相较于现有方法表现出更优的性能。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法通常仅从文本或图像中单独检索，无法有效处理需要多跳推理或最新事实知识的复杂查询。

Method: QA-Dragon通过领域路由器和搜索路由器动态选择检索策略，协调文本和图像搜索代理，支持多模态、多轮和多跳推理。

Result: 在Meta CRAG-MM挑战赛中，QA-Dragon在单源、多源和多轮任务中分别比基线提高了5.06%、6.35%和5.03%。

Conclusion: QA-Dragon显著提升了知识密集型VQA任务的表现，特别是在多模态、多轮和多跳推理方面，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Motivation: 现有方法松散耦合符号和神经模块，设计将决策树和随机森林作为可调用预言机嵌入统一推理系统，以提升推理性能。

Method: 提出了一种混合架构，将基于决策树的符号推理与大型语言模型（LLM）的生成能力集成在一个协调的多智能体框架中。决策树模块支持可解释的规则推理和因果逻辑，而LLM智能体处理溯因推理、泛化和交互式规划。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，如ProofWriter的蕴含一致性提升7.2%，GSM8k的多步数学问题准确率提高5.3%，ARC的抽象准确率提升6.0%。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了一个稳健、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Method: 论文提出了NomicLaw，一个结构化的多智能体模拟环境，LLMs在其中通过提出规则、论证和投票来参与协作立法。通过投票模式和策略性语言使用来定量和定性地评估信任与互惠。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs在模拟环境中能够自发形成联盟、背叛信任，并调整其修辞以影响集体决策。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，大型语言模型（LLMs）在开放、多智能体环境中展现出潜在的社会推理和说服能力，为未来AI系统在自主谈判、协调和立法起草方面的设计提供了见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

Motivation: 尽管最小模型推理在知识表示中很重要，但在描述逻辑中的纯最小模型问题仍未得到充分研究。

Method: 研究了纯最小模型在描述逻辑中的可满足性问题，并探讨了无环条件对可判定性的影响。

Result: 纯最小模型的概念可满足性在$\mathcal{EL}$中不可判定，通过无环条件可恢复可判定性，但复杂度高达双指数时间。

Conclusion: 在流行的描述逻辑中，纯最小模型的概念可满足性是不可判定的，即使在简单的$\mathcal{EL}$中也是如此。通过施加无环条件，可以恢复可判定性，但复杂度仍较高。

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型在处理复杂的多问题推理任务时表现不佳，传统奖励机制过于粗糙，无法有效指导模型学习。

Method: StructVRM是一种方法，通过训练基于模型的验证器，提供细粒度、子问题级别的反馈，评估语义和数学等价性，而非依赖严格的字符串匹配。

Result: 实验证明，StructVRM在六个公共多模态基准和新策划的高难度STEM-Bench上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: StructVRM的成功验证了使用结构化、可验证的奖励训练多模态模型在复杂现实推理领域中是一种高效的方法。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Method: 该方法实现了一个处理流程，包括样本预处理、增量分类与机器学习模型以及结果解释。其创新点在于实时构建统计和频率相关特征的预处理模块以及解释性模块。

Result: 实验结果显示，F-measure超过98%，准确率达到99%。即使在类别不平衡和噪声存在的情况下，该流程仍保持高性能。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

TL;DR: DeepPHY是一个新基准框架，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的物理理解和推理能力，发现现有模型在将物理知识转化为精确控制方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂动态环境中对细节的关注和精确行动规划方面表现不佳，而现实任务通常需要复杂的交互、高级空间推理、长期规划和持续策略优化，这些都需要对目标场景的物理规则有深刻理解。然而，在真实场景中评估这些能力成本过高。

Method: 引入DeepPHY框架，通过一系列具有挑战性的模拟环境，结合多难度级别的物理推理环境和细粒度评估指标，系统评估VLMs的物理理解和推理能力。

Result: 评估发现，即使是最先进的VLMs也难以将描述性物理知识转化为精确的预测控制。

Conclusion: 尽管最先进的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在描述性物理知识转化为精确预测控制方面表现不佳，但DeepPHY作为一个新颖的基准框架，为系统评估VLMs的物理理解和推理能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

Conclusion: 大语言模型（LLMs）与图神经网络、量子计算和实时光谱技术的结合，为快速、可靠且包容性的分子创新提供了路径，但仍需解决数据集偏见、推理不透明和安全问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

TL;DR: 研究提出Bench-2-CoP框架，量化AI基准测试与欧盟AI法案的差距，发现现有评估严重忽视系统性风险，呼吁政策与工具升级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着欧盟AI法案等新规出台，现有AI评估工具无法有效衡量系统性风险，亟需量化这一‘基准-监管差距’。

Method: 研究团队开发了Bench-2-CoP框架，通过LLM-as-judge分析方法，将194,955个广泛使用的基准测试问题与欧盟AI法案的能力分类进行映射对比。

Result: 研究发现评估生态严重偏向行为倾向（如‘幻觉倾向’占53.7%），而关键功能能力（如逃避人类监督、自主AI开发）完全未被覆盖，导致系统性风险（如‘失控’仅0.4%覆盖率）评估近乎空白。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前AI评估体系与新兴监管需求之间的严重不匹配，特别是系统性风险（如失控场景）的评估空白，为政策制定者和开发者提供了关键改进方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

TL;DR: 利用小型LLM生成多样化的ERC数据集，有效提升分类器性能并解决标签不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC数据稀缺且现有数据集存在偏见和主观性，LLM在ERC任务（尤其是数据生成）中的应用受限。

Method: 采用小型、资源高效的通用LLM合成具有多样性的ERC数据集，补充了三个广泛使用的ERC基准数据集。

Result: 生成的六个新数据集显著提升了ERC分类器的性能，并在标签不平衡问题上表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 使用小型、资源高效且通用的LLM生成的ERC数据集能有效提升现有ERC分类器的性能，并增强对标签不平衡问题的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

TL;DR: InfiAlign框架通过数据高效的后训练方法提升LLMs推理能力，显著减少数据需求并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型(LLMs)在复杂任务上表现出色，但提升其推理能力的数据和计算成本高昂，现有方法依赖于启发式或任务特定策略，难以扩展。

Method: 引入InfiAlign框架，结合监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，通过多维质量指标自动筛选高质量对齐数据。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base模型上，仅使用约12%的训练数据即达到与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B相当的性能，并在AIME 24/25基准上平均提升3.89%。

Conclusion: 结合原则性数据选择和全阶段后训练的方法，为大规模推理模型的对齐提供了可扩展且数据高效的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理结构化知识（如知识图谱）时表现有限，且当前图检索方法难以平衡全局结构和精确控制。

Method: GRAIL采用LLM引导的随机探索与路径过滤结合的数据合成流程，并通过两阶段训练学习动态决策策略。

Result: 在三个知识图谱问答数据集上，GRAIL平均准确率提升21.01%，F1分数提升22.43%。

Conclusion: GRAIL框架通过整合LLM引导的随机探索和路径过滤，显著提升了知识图谱问答任务的准确性和F1分数。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

Method: 作者提出了一个模块化、可通用的框架，通过将任务分解为子任务并利用可用信息（如代理的输出和推理）验证每一步，模拟人类评估过程。

Result: 在GAIA和BigCodeBench基准测试中，提出的Judge Agent在任务成功预测上与人类评估的一致性更高，准确率分别提高了4.76%和10.52%。

Conclusion: 作者提出的通用评估框架在Magentic-One Actor Agent上的验证表明，其预测任务成功的准确率相较于基于GPT-4o的LLM-as-a-Judge基线分别提高了4.76%和10.52%，证明了该框架的潜力。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Motivation: 社交媒体已成为复杂的多模态环境，有害意图（如讽刺、仇恨言论或虚假信息）常隐藏在多模态矛盾和文化快速变化中，传统方法难以有效检测。

Method: 提出了MV-Debate框架，包含四个互补的辩论代理（表面分析师、深度推理者、模态对比者和社会情境分析者），通过迭代辩论和动态反思门控优化检测结果。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，MV-Debate显著优于单一模型和现有多代理辩论基线方法。

Conclusion: MV-Debate框架通过多视角代理辩论和动态反思门控，显著提升了多模态有害内容检测的准确性和效率，为安全关键在线环境中的可靠社会意图检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 AI 系统依赖大量高质量训练数据和人工设计的奖励函数，面临可扩展性挑战，阻碍了真正自主智能的发展。AIF 可以填补 'grounded-agency gap'，使智能体能够自主制定、调整和追求目标。

Method: 通过将 AIF 的决策框架与大型语言模型结合，替代外部奖励信号，使用内在的自由能最小化驱动，使智能体能够自主地平衡探索与利用。

Result: AIF 能够通过自由能最小化的内在驱动，使智能体高效地从经验中学习，同时保持与人类价值观的对齐。

Conclusion: Active Inference (AIF) 结合大型语言模型作为生成世界模型，提供了一个有前景的路径，使 AI 系统能够在自主发展的同时保持与人类价值观的一致性，并遵守计算和物理约束。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.
