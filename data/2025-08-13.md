Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI通过结合分子图像和功能基团序列，提升了药物相互作用预测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于功能基团表征学习的局限性，而药物相互作用本质上是基团间的相互作用，因此需要从全局和局部结构更全面地表示药物对。

Method: 提出ImageDDI框架，将药物分子转换为功能基团序列，并使用基于Transformer的编码器进行嵌入，同时通过自适应特征融合整合分子图像的全局信息。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上，ImageDDI优于现有最优方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过结合分子图像的全局信息和功能基团的局部序列表示，显著提升了药物相互作用预测的性能，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现出竞争力。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

TL;DR: 本文综述了在资源受限的TinyML设备上优化目标检测模型的技术，包括量化、剪枝等，并比较了现有实现的性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备数量激增，但资源受限的设备难以处理深度学习目标检测模型的计算负载，TinyML为解决这一问题提供了潜力。现有研究忽略了在TinyML环境中部署目标检测模型的优化挑战。

Method: 本文采用量化、剪枝、知识蒸馏和神经架构搜索等优化技术，并结合理论和实际实现进行分析。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

### [4] [Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08421)
*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用流程和NTKD方法，显著提升了混合光学神经网络的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多数据集和硬件上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONNs）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有能效优势，但其应用受到训练准确性差距和模拟与实际系统间差异的限制。现有方法缺乏跨任务和硬件设计的通用性。

Method: 论文引入了神经切线知识蒸馏（NTKD）方法，用于在训练时对齐光学模型与电子教师网络，并在制造后指导数字后端的微调以补偿实现误差。此外，还提出了一个在训练前基于用户指定约束（如物理尺寸和数据集）估计模型可实现准确性的方法。

Result: 实验证明，该流程在多个数据集（如MNIST、CIFAR、Carvana Masking）和硬件配置上一致提升了ONN性能，并在仿真和实际实现中均取得了实用部署效果。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的流程，显著提高了混合光学神经网络（ONNs）的性能，并在多个数据集和硬件配置上验证了其有效性，为实际部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [5] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，通过模块化设计和3E原则解决了长序列视频生成的局限性，实验证明其在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力不足、视觉质量欠佳和表现力有限的问题，MAViS旨在通过多智能体协作解决这些局限性。

Method: MAViS采用端到端多智能体协作框架，涵盖脚本撰写、镜头设计、角色建模、关键帧生成、视频动画和音频生成等阶段，每个阶段遵循3E原则（探索、检查、增强）。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和视频表现力方面达到最先进水平，并能通过简短用户提示生成高质量的长序列叙事视频。

Conclusion: MAViS通过多智能体协作框架，显著提升了长序列视频生成的辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力，其模块化设计还支持与多样化生成模型和工具的扩展。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装扩散框架，通过三个模块联合建模上下服装和人物身份，显著提升虚拟试衣的真实性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法在处理多服装和保留个人身份特征（如纹身、配饰和体型）方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出了三个关键模块：Garment Representation Module (GRM)、Person Representation Module (PRM)和A-DiT融合模块，通过扩散变换器整合服装、人物和文本提示特征。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成了高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON通过统一的扩散框架和多模块设计，显著提升了虚拟试衣的真实性和灵活性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CObL 是一种扩散模型，通过并行生成物体层来理解场景中的物体关系，无需用户提示即可处理多物体遮挡问题，并能零样本泛化到真实世界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了从图像中推断出包含遮挡顺序堆叠的物体层的场景表示，以更好地理解物体的空间关系（横向和深度）。

Method: 引入了基于扩散的架构 Concurrent Object Layers (CObL)，利用 Stable Diffusion 作为自然物体的先验，并通过推理时指导确保推断的层能复合回输入图像。

Result: CObL 在合成图像上训练后，能够零样本泛化到真实世界多物体场景，且无需用户提示或预先知道物体数量。

Conclusion: CObL 是一种能够零样本泛化到真实世界多物体场景的扩散模型，无需用户提示或预先知道物体数量，突破了以往模型的限制。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型在漫画叙事理解中表现不佳，尤其在时序因果和跨面板连贯性上。研究提出新评估框架，揭示模型在长篇幅叙事中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前VLMs在表面识别与深层叙事推理之间的关键差距，特别是在处理时序视觉叙事（如漫画）时的局限性。

Method: 研究采用了多模态标注、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估的综合框架，包括（i）通过轻小说文本对齐的视觉元素标注，（ii）多推理范式的全面评估，（iii）跨模态相似性分析。

Result: 在Re:Zero漫画的308个标注面板上测试表明，现有模型缺乏真正的故事级智能，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和跨面板因果推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在长篇幅叙事理解上存在显著不足，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和因果推理方面表现不佳。本研究为评估叙事智能提供了方法论基础。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR 是一种通过视觉输入控制 VLM 行为的新方法，无需模型内部访问，性能优于现有技术，并暴露了视觉操纵的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法（如系统提示或激活引导向量）存在易检测、低效或侵入性问题，VISOR 旨在提供一种无感知且高效的控制方案。

Method: VISOR 通过优化视觉输入（通用引导图像）来诱导目标激活模式，无需侵入模型内部或运行时访问，适用于所有 VLM 服务模式。

Result: 在 LLaVA-1.5-7B 上验证，VISOR 在拒绝、谄媚和生存本能任务中表现优异，单张 150KB 引导图像性能接近引导向量（1-2% 差距），负向引导效果远超（25% 变化）。同时保持 99.9% 的 MMLU 任务性能。

Conclusion: VISOR 提出了一种通过视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，揭示了多模态模型中视觉操纵的安全漏洞，并强调了防御视觉引导攻击的紧迫性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [10] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过平行文本行图像和距离损失函数，显著提升了Kindai历史文档的OCR识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kindai文档具有重要的历史研究价值，但其转录工作耗时且标注数据有限，制约了OCR系统的训练效果。

Method: 利用平行文本行图像对（原始Kindai文本与现代日语字体对照）来扩充训练数据集，并引入基于欧几里得距离和最大均值差异（MMD）的领域适应度量作为目标函数。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在使用欧几里得距离和MMD时，分别将字符错误率（CER）降低了2.23%和3.94%。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入基于距离的损失函数，有效减少了Kindai文档OCR的字符错误率，并提升了自注意力特征的质量，为历史文档的OCR识别提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

### [11] [Calibration Attention: Instance-wise Temperature Scaling for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08547)
*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalAttn通过学习自适应温度值，显著降低Vision Transformers的校准误差，同时保持高效和架构无关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Vision Transformers在风险敏感应用中部署时需要概率校准，而传统的温度缩放方法仅使用单一的全局标量且需要验证集。

Method: 引入Calibration Attention (CalAttn)模块，通过学习自适应的每实例温度值，直接利用ViT的CLS令牌进行调整。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低了高达4倍，同时仅增加不到0.1%的参数量。

Conclusion: CalAttn是一种简单、高效且架构无关的模块，能够在Vision Transformers中显著降低校准误差，同时不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DTLP-Net通过多样化的教师模型和标签传播技术，有效解决了医学图像分割中的标注不足和领域偏移问题，在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中标注不足和领域偏移带来的挑战，如半监督医学图像分割（SSMIS）、半监督医学领域泛化（Semi-MDG）和无监督医学领域自适应（UMDA）。传统方法孤立处理特定任务，导致错误累积和性能受限。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net，包括一个学生模型和两个多样化的教师模型，通过解耦训练过程和周期性动量更新生成可靠的伪标签。结合样本间和样本内数据增强，以及标签传播技术，增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的评估显示，DTLP-Net在所有任务中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架在SSMIS、UMDA和Semi-MDG任务中表现优异，显著优于现有方法，展示了其在解决更具挑战性的半监督学习场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLIPNET通过双模式设计（恢复/退化）有效解决扩散模型与BFR的适配问题，提升盲人脸恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型与BFR设置之间的固有差距，包括高质量与低质量图像、合成与真实世界图像的差异。

Method: FLIPNET采用双模式设计：恢复模式逐步整合BFR导向特征和人脸嵌入；退化模式基于真实退化数据集合成类似真实世界的退化图像。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，且退化模型能更准确模拟真实退化。

Conclusion: FLIPNET模型在盲人脸恢复（BFR）任务中表现出色，不仅在真实性保真度上超越基于扩散先验的BFR方法，还能更好地模拟真实世界的退化模式。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Motivation: 现有算法在小型训练数据集上难以捕捉通用视觉表示，且VFMs（如SAM）虽适合分割但无法识别关键解剖点，这对于LV指标测量至关重要。

Method: 提出了AutoSAME框架，结合了SAM的分割能力和标志点定位任务，并引入了FCBA和SGPA技术来优化视觉表示和密集预测。

Conclusion: AutoSAME框架通过结合SAM的视觉理解能力与分割和标志点定位任务，成功地模拟了心脏超声医师的操作，实现了与临床指南一致的LV指标测量。FCBA和SGPA的设计进一步优化了视觉表示和密集预测的准确性。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助注释或假设源和目标域具有相同的组别，这在现实场景中不自然且不实用。论文旨在克服这些限制，提出一种更自然且实用的解决方案。

Method: 该方法利用预训练的视觉语言模型，通过基于梯度的注意力机制来解耦超类相关和不相关的特征，并鼓励使用所有超类相关特征进行预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在领域泛化任务中显著优于基线，定量指标和定性可视化均有明显提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法通过利用类标签的语义结构（特别是超类信息）来减少对虚假特征的依赖，显著提高了领域泛化任务的性能，无需对源样本进行注释。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Conclusion: 本文提出的DocThinker框架通过基于规则的强化学习方法，显著提高了多模态大语言模型在文档理解任务中的可解释性和适应性，同时避免了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

Motivation: 解决DETR-based方法中随机初始化查询缺乏显式语义导致检测性能不佳的问题。

Method: 采用ACTOR（跨模态Transformer编码器）和PDQD（感知蒸馏查询解码器）的双分支查询初始化方法，生成更具语义意义的查询表示。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的QueryCraft框架通过结合语义先验和引导特征学习，显著提升了HOI检测性能，并在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the

Conclusion: TransMiter 有效且高效地实现了视觉语言模型间适应知识的迁移，同时保持了不同规模和架构模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Conclusion: HVPL模型通过帧级和视频级的视觉提示学习，有效解决了现有视频实例分割方法中的类别遗忘问题，并在实验中展现出优于基线方法的性能。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from

shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time

navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Motivation: 尽管现有研究已分别提升了空间和时间理解能力，但缺乏同时整合两者的方法，限制了模型性能。

Method: 通过将观察到的关键点视觉痕迹投影到深度图上，从而同时捕捉空间和时间信息。

Result: 在SimplerEnv实验中，该方法比SpatialVLA和TraceVLA分别提高了4%和19%的任务解决成功率，且所需训练数据极少。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通过视觉提示同时整合空间和时间信息的新方法，显著提高了任务解决的成功率，且在数据稀缺的实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN方法在定量和定性分析中均优于现有的九种MMIF方法，且其组件经消融实验验证有效。该方法还可扩展到其他图像融合任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

Motivation: 超声变形配准在低对比度、高噪声和模糊组织边界的超声图像中面临挑战，现有方法在解剖对齐和物理可解释性上表现不佳。

Method: 提出PADReg框架，利用机器人超声系统同步测量的接触力作为物理先验，构建像素级刚度图，并通过受胡克定律启发的物理感知模块估计变形场。

Result: 在体内数据集上，PADReg的HD95达到12.90，比当前最优方法提升了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过结合接触力和超声图像的多模态信息，构建像素级刚度图，并利用轻量级物理感知模块估计变形场，显著提高了超声变形配准的解剖对齐效果和物理合理性。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ROD提出了一种仅依赖RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法，通过预训练的Vision Transformer和轻量级解码器，显著提高了检测精度和推理速度，成为新的SOTA。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

TL;DR: 论文提出CBAND，一种基于深度学习的高效无参考视频质量评估工具，显著提升带状伪影预测性能，并开源数据集和模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 带状伪影严重影响高清视频在高端HDTV或高分辨率屏幕上的感知质量，现有数据集仅限于静态图像，无法反映时间动态，因此需要系统性研究带状伪影视频质量评估问题。

Method: 通过创建首个开放的带状伪影视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding，并利用深度学习网络嵌入中自然图像统计特性，开发了CBAND这一高效的无参考视频质量评估工具。

Result: 实验结果表明，CBAND在感知带状伪影预测性能上显著优于现有模型，且速度快多个数量级。

Conclusion: CBAND作为一种新型的无参考（NR）视频质量评估工具，在感知带状伪影预测性能上显著优于现有最先进模型，且速度更快。此外，CBAND还可作为可微分损失函数用于优化视频去带状伪影模型。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在视觉识别中常因语义子群体代表性不足而产生系统性错误，现有修复方法依赖手动设计的提示生成合成图像，易导致分布偏移和语义错误。

Method: 使用条件性文本到图像模型生成语义忠实且针对性的图像，并结合大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）过滤输出，确保与原始数据分布对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 通过使用罕见案例增强的合成数据集重新训练视觉模型，显著减少了与罕见案例相关的错误。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的针对性修复策略显著提高了模型鲁棒性，且未引入新错误。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出自适应置信度损失（ACW）改进镜头结构分割，通过区域加权和动态阈值优化，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度分割网络通常对所有像素平等加权，忽略了镜头结构子区域的不均匀性及边界区域的像素级分割校准问题。临床专家在标注时考虑了子区域比例、模糊边界和镜头结构形状等因素，赋予不同置信度。

Method: 提出了一种自适应置信度损失（ACW），通过置信度阈值将镜头结构子区域分组，并应用区域加权损失来重新加权每个置信度组，同时设计了自适应置信度阈值优化算法。

Result: ACW在U-Net等不同深度分割网络中显著优于竞争性分割损失方法，特别是在镜头结构分割中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床镜头结构AS-OCT数据集和其他多结构数据集上表现优异，显著优于其他分割损失方法，如IoU增益6.13%、DSC增加4.33%和BECE减少4.79%。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

TL;DR: 论文提出模拟社交网络视频共享管道的框架，以增强深度伪造检测器在压缩视频内容中的泛化能力，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络上AI生成视频的增多给深度伪造检测带来新挑战，尤其是在受控条件下训练的检测器难以泛化到现实场景。主要原因在于平台采用的专有压缩技术会破坏低级法医线索。

Method: 提出了一种框架，通过从少量上传视频中估计压缩和调整大小参数，模拟社交网络的视频共享管道，从而在无需直接API访问的情况下，大规模复制平台特定的退化模式。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据能紧密匹配真实上传视频的退化模式，且在模拟视频上微调的检测器性能与在实际共享媒体上训练的检测器相当。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种通过模拟社交网络视频共享管道来增强深度伪造检测器泛化能力的框架，为解决实验室训练与实际部署之间的差距提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检索系统通常设计用于简单、受控场景，而现实场景更为复杂，需要基于模糊、自由形式的描述在杂乱场景中识别对象。

Method: ROOMELSA专注于全景房间图像中的特定区域，并准确从大型数据库中检索对应的3D模型。

Result: 尽管粗粒度对象检索已基本解决，但仅有一个顶级模型在几乎所有测试案例中始终排名第一。轻量级CLIP模型表现良好，但在材料、部件结构和上下文线索的细微变化上仍有困难。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA通过弥合场景级基础与细粒度3D检索之间的差距，为推进稳健、真实的3D识别系统设立了新基准。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Method: 使用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导并约束额外比特的分配。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp 是一种端到端的区域自适应视频锐化模型，有效提升了感知增强并节省了比特率。实验证明了该模型在质量和量化指标上的有效性。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF 提出了一种新颖的单目动态人体渲染框架，通过双向变形模型和基于部分的姿态嵌入机制，显著提升了在复杂姿态和遮挡条件下的渲染质量。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

TL;DR: OffSeg通过动态优化特征和类别偏移，解决了轻量级语义分割中的特征不对齐问题，显著提升性能且参数增加极少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级语义分割方法由于采用逐像素分类范式，导致类别表示与图像特征之间的不对齐问题，限制了性能。

Method: 提出了一种耦合双分支偏移学习范式，通过学习特征和类别的偏移量来动态优化类别表示和空间图像特征，并构建了一个高效的语义分割网络OffSeg。

Result: 在ADE20K、Cityscapes等四个数据集上的实验表明，该范式能显著提升现有方法（如SegFormer-B0等）的性能，仅需0.1-0.2M额外参数即可实现1.9%-2.7%的mIoU提升。

Conclusion: 提出的耦合双分支偏移学习范式（OffSeg）通过动态优化类别表示和空间图像特征，显著提升了现有语义分割方法的性能，且仅需少量额外参数。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Motivation: 解决多LoRA模块组合在多概念生成中导致的身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏问题。

Method: 提出了Token-Aware LoRA (TARA)，通过令牌掩码显式约束每个模块专注于其关联的稀有令牌，并引入训练目标以确保稀有令牌的注意力与其概念区域对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，TARA能够高效进行多概念推理，并有效避免模块间的相互干扰，保留每个概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA通过引入令牌掩码和训练目标，有效解决了多概念LoRA模块组合中的身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏问题，实现了高效的多概念推理。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种无需参考图像的质量评估（NR-IQA）方法，通过分析图像曲率来量化图像质量。

Method: 提出了一种基于方向性图像曲率分析的两阶段系统，包括使用各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）度量和专用回归模型。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR分数与人类感知的Spearman相关性约为-0.93（高斯模糊）和-0.95（白噪声）。完整系统的R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS点。

Conclusion: 该框架作为一种稳健的双用途工具，用于图像退化的分类和后续量化。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的端到端学习框架通过自适应高频预处理策略，在视频编码中实现了主观质量的提升和比特率的节省。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS

Conclusion: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) 通过提出的跨视图网络和创新的融合范式，显著提升了在复杂环境和时变场景中的性能表现。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的文本条件状态空间模型（TCSSM），用于解决CDVQA任务中的域偏移问题，并通过实验验证了其优于现有方法的性能。代码和数据集将在接受后公开。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的加速方法在跳过早期或中期去噪步骤时会导致结构差异，影响指令跟随和角色一致性。

Method: 采用固定点视角预测噪声输出，通过校准余弦相似性和范数比率来优化连续噪声增量。

Result: 在Latte-1、OpenSora-Plan v110和Wan2.1上，TaoCache在相同加速条件下比现有缓存方法获得了更高的视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）。

Conclusion: TaoCache通过固定点视角预测噪声输出，显著提升了视频扩散模型在后期去噪阶段的加速效果，且在保持高分辨率结构的同时实现了激进的跳过，与现有加速方法正交且兼容。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

Method: 研究开发了一个名为ColorGPT的管道，通过系统测试多种颜色表示和有效的提示工程技术构建而成，主要针对调色板完成和全调色板生成任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于LLM的管道在颜色建议准确性和调色板分布方面优于现有方法，全调色板生成任务中颜色多样性和相似性也有所提升。

Conclusion: 本研究通过开发ColorGPT管道，证明了预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）在颜色推荐任务中的优越性，特别是在颜色建议准确性和调色板多样性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs在长视频序列中因计算需求大而采用压缩策略，但可能忽略关键帧信息，影响性能。

Method: 采用基于时间冗余的关键帧识别方法，并根据上下文相关性分配不同的压缩比率，同时引入时空建模模块。

Result: 在长视频场景的广泛实验中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus通过智能压缩视频令牌和强调关键帧信息，显著提升了视频LLMs的计算效率和准确性。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

Motivation: 当前运动表示方法存在两大局限：(i) 无法从多尺度捕捉运动，限制了复杂模式建模能力；(ii) 缺乏组合灵活性，影响模型在多样化生成任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 引入MSQ，一种新颖的多尺度量化方法，将运动序列在空间和时间维度上压缩为多尺度离散标记。使用不同的编码器捕捉不同空间粒度的身体部位，并在时间维度上进行多尺度插值后量化为离散标记。

Result: MSQ方法在多个基准测试中优于现有基线方法，能够无缝组合运动标记，支持运动编辑、控制和条件生成。

Conclusion: MSQ方法通过多尺度量化和生成掩码建模，显著提升了运动生成的灵活性和性能，无需专门设计或重新训练。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniConvNet通过三层次感受野聚合器和层次操作符的设计，成功扩展了有效感受野（ERF）并保持了其渐近高斯分布（AGD），在各种视觉识别任务中表现出色，优于当前最先进的CNN和ViT模型。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

Conclusion: 通过减少组件间残差（ICR），提出的IRetinex模型在低光图像增强任务中在质量和数量上均优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Conclusion: UC-Seg框架通过整合两个不同的子网络和引入交叉子网一致性保持策略及不确定性感知伪标签生成组件，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的准确性和泛化性能，优于当前最先进的方法。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

Conclusion: DPGNet通过双路径引导网络有效解决了跨领域差异和未标注数据利用问题，显著提升了深度伪造检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Conclusion: 本文提出的主动学习框架成功解决了视频异常检测在动态环境中的适应性挑战，通过人机协同机制和自适应阈值定义，显著提升了模型在实际应用中的效果。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and

Motivation: 解决复杂交通环境中开放集感知的挑战，特别是识别未见过的物体类别，以确保自动驾驶系统的安全性。

Method: 提出了VLM-3D，一种端到端框架，利用LoRA高效适配VLMs，并引入联合语义-几何损失设计（早期使用token级语义损失，后期引入3D IoU损失）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，VLM-3D的感知准确性提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D框架通过联合语义-几何损失设计显著提升了自动驾驶场景中的感知准确性，验证了该方法的有效性和先进性。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

TL;DR: 本文提出Turbo-VAED，通过优化VAE架构和训练方法，首次实现移动设备上720p视频VAE的实时解码，显著提升速度并减少资源占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型生成AI模型在移动设备上的部署需求增加，而现有视频VAE模型的参数规模和不匹配的核函数导致内存不足或推理速度极慢，因此需要一种低成本的解决方案。

Method: 通过分析现有VAE架构的冗余性，整合3D深度可分离卷积减少参数数量；提出解耦的3D像素洗牌方案优化上采样技术；开发了一种高效的VAE解码器训练方法，仅对解码器进行蒸馏以适应移动设备。

Result: Turbo-VAED在GPU上加速原始VAE达84.5倍，参数数量低至原版的17.5%，重建质量保留96.9%。在iPhone 16 Pro上，Turbo-VAED的FPS提升2.9倍，且重建质量优于其他移动优化VAE。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Turbo-VAED方法首次在移动设备上实现了720p视频VAE的实时解码，显著降低了参数数量和计算延迟，同时保持了较高的重建质量。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

Result: 提出了一种更简单的O(m)-竞争确定性算法，验证了(2m-1)-竞争比的猜想。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种更简单的替代算法设计和分析，以解决在线运输问题，验证了Kalyanasundaram和Pruhs的猜想。

Abstract: The setting for the online transportation problem is a metric space $M$,
populated by $m$ parking garages of varying capacities. Over time cars arrive
in $M$, and must be irrevocably assigned to a parking garage upon arrival in a
way that respects the garage capacities. The objective is to minimize the
aggregate distance traveled by the cars. In 1998, Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs
conjectured that there is a $(2m-1)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for
the online transportation problem, matching the optimal competitive ratio for
the simpler online metric matching problem. Recently, Harada and Itoh presented
the first $O(m)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for the online
transportation problem. Our contribution is an alternative algorithm design and
analysis that we believe is simpler.

TL;DR: 论文设计了一个确定性编译器，使Congested Clique模型中的计算能抵抗恒定比例的崩溃故障，通过LDCs和查询集优化实现低复杂度开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在Congested Clique模型中，节点崩溃故障对计算的影响，确保计算在部分节点崩溃时仍能高效完成。

Method: 论文提出了一种确定性编译器，利用局部可解码码（LDCs）在崩溃节点位置已知的情况下，通过确定性选择查询集来避免多处擦除，并平衡每个节点的查询负载以防止拥塞。

Result: 展示了在崩溃故障模型中，网络可以在$d\cdot\lceil\frac{\omega}{n^2}+\frac{\Delta}{n}\rceil\cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{\log{n}}\log\log{n})}$轮次内计算任何电路，并将任何$T$-轮算法编译为$T^2 n^{o(1)}$轮完成。

Conclusion: 该论文设计了一个确定性编译器，使得在Congested Clique模型中的任何计算都能抵抗恒定比例的对抗性崩溃故障。通过局部可解码码（LDCs）和查询集的确定性选择，实现了低复杂度开销。

Abstract: We design a deterministic compiler that makes any computation in the
Congested Clique model robust to a constant fraction $\alpha<1$ of adversarial
crash faults. In particular, we show how a network of $n$ nodes can compute any
circuit of depth $d$, width $\omega$, and gate total fan $\Delta$, in
$d\cdot\lceil\frac{\omega}{n^2}+\frac{\Delta}{n}\rceil\cdot
2^{O(\sqrt{\log{n}}\log\log{n})}$ rounds in such a faulty model. As a
corollary, any $T$-round Congested Clique algorithm can be compiled into an
algorithm that completes in $T^2 n^{o(1)}$ rounds in this model.
  Our compiler obtains resilience to node crashes by coding information across
the network, where we leverage locally-decodable codes (LDCs) to maintain a low
complexity overhead, as these allow recovering the information needed at each
computational step by querying only small parts of the codeword.
  The main technical contribution is that because erasures occur in known
locations, which correspond to crashed nodes, we can derandomize classical LDC
constructions by deterministically selecting query sets that avoid sufficiently
many erasures. Moreover, when decoding multiple codewords in parallel, our
derandomization load-balances the queries per-node, thereby preventing
congestion and maintaining a low round complexity.
  Deterministic decoding of LDCs presents a new challenge: the adversary can
target precisely the (few) nodes that are queried for decoding a certain
codeword. We overcome this issue via an adaptive doubling strategy: if a
decoding attempt for a codeword fails, the node doubles the number of its
decoding attempts. Similarly, when the adversary crashes the decoding node
itself, we replace it dynamically with two other non-crashed nodes. By
carefully combining these two doubling processes, we overcome the challenges
posed by the combination of a deterministic LDC with a worst case pattern of
crashes.

Motivation: 在线调度问题中，作业的动态插入和删除使得实时计算近优解成为挑战，尤其是在作业迁移受限的情况下，如何在均匀机器上实现高效近似是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 通过将机器分为大机器和小机器，并根据当前近似目标值采取不同策略，结合一种新的不依赖于当前目标值的实例舍入方法，实现了高效的近似方案。

Result: 提出了针对$Q||C_{\max}$和$Q||C_{\min}$问题的高效多项式时间近似方案（EPTAS），并证明了在恒定摊销迁移因子$\beta$下的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了在在线调度问题中，针对均匀机器上作业迁移限制的高效多项式时间近似方案（EPTAS），首次实现了在多项式时间内近似求解的目标，填补了该领域在均匀机器上的研究空白。

Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling $n$ jobs on $m$ uniform machines while
minimizing the makespan ($Q||C_{\max}$) and maximizing the minimum completion
time ($Q||C_{\min}$) in an online setting with migration of jobs. In this
online setting, the jobs are inserted or deleted over time, and at each step,
the goal is to compute a near-optimal solution while reassigning some jobs,
such that the overall processing time of reassigned jobs, called migration, is
bounded by some factor $\beta$ times the processing time of the job added or
removed.
  We propose Efficient Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (EPTASs) with an
additional load error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon p_{\max})$ for both problems,
with constant amortized migration factor $\beta$, where $p_{\max}$ is the
maximum processing time in the instance over all steps. As an intermediate
step, we obtain Efficient Parameterized Approximation Schemes (EPASs) for both
problems, $(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithms parameterized by $p_{\max}$
and the number of different processing times $d$ in an instance, with $\beta$
bounded in a function of $p_{\max}$, $d$ and $\varepsilon$.
  This is the first result in the direction of a polynomial time approximation
scheme in the field of online scheduling with bounded reassignment on uniform
machines; before, such results were known only for the considered problems on
identical machines. Crucial to our result is a division of the machines into
large and small machines depending on the current approximate objective value,
allowing for different approaches on either machine set, as well as a new way
of rounding the instance that does not depend on the current objective value.

Conclusion: 该论文展示了使用软件定义无线电（SDRs）实现可证明安全的隐蔽射频通信，验证了理论预测，并为隐蔽通信系统的实际应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The fundamental information-theoretic limits of covert, or low probability of
detection/intercept (LPD/LPI), communication have been extensively studied for
over a decade, resulting in the square root law (SRL): only $L\sqrt{n}$ covert
bits can be reliably transmitted over time-bandwidth product $n$, for constant
$L>0$. Transmitting more either results in detection or decoding errors. The
SRL imposes significant constraints on hardware realization of
mathematically-guaranteed covert communication. Indeed, they preclude using
standard link maintenance operations that are taken for granted in non-covert
communication. Thus, experimental validation of covert communication is
underexplored: to date, only two experimental studies of SRL-based covert
communication are available, both focusing on optical channels. Here, we report
a demonstration of provably-secure covert radio-frequency (RF) communication
using software-defined radios (SDRs). This validates theoretical predictions,
opens practical avenues for implementing covert communication systems, and
raises further research questions.

Abstract: Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) represent a promising technology
that enables diverse underwater applications through acoustic communication.
However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication
environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This
paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater
networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the
scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g.,
transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication
multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware
Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic
load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring
nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and
global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization
algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based
decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the
computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of
TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision
probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach
in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with
limited resources.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于代理的边缘辅助MAR通信服务配置方法，通过LLM驱动的数字代理和用户级QoE建模，优化通信资源管理，提升QoE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动增强现实（MAR）在6G中被视为关键沉浸式应用，但现有网络控制器无法访问MAR应用特定信息，且用户数据流量模式具有依赖性和动态性，需解决这些问题以降低通信开销并确保体验质量（QoE）。

Method: 1. 建立由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的数字代理，以弥合MAR服务与网络领域之间的数据和功能差距；2. 开发用户级QoE建模方法，捕捉通信资源需求与感知用户QoE之间的关系，实现个性化的代理驱动通信资源管理。

Result: 基于实际数据驱动的仿真结果表明，该方法在用户级QoE建模精度和通信资源效率上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于代理的通信服务配置方法在用户级QoE建模精度和通信资源效率上均优于传统的基于LLM的QoE感知服务配置方法。

Abstract: Mobile augmented reality (MAR) is envisioned as a key immersive application
in 6G, enabling virtual content rendering aligned with the physical environment
through device pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel agent-driven
communication service provisioning approach for edge-assisted MAR, aiming to
reduce communication overhead between MAR devices and the edge server while
ensuring the quality of experience (QoE). First, to address the inaccessibility
of MAR application-specific information to the network controller, we establish
a digital agent powered by large language models (LLMs) on behalf of the MAR
service provider, bridging the data and function gap between the MAR service
and network domains. Second, to cope with the user-dependent and dynamic nature
of data traffic patterns for individual devices, we develop a user-level QoE
modeling method that captures the relationship between communication resource
demands and perceived user QoE, enabling personalized, agent-driven
communication resource management. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms conventional LLM-based QoE-aware service
provisioning methods in both user-level QoE modeling accuracy and communication
resource efficiency.

TL;DR: DUAL-Health是一个不确定性感知的多模态融合框架，用于解决户外健康监测中的噪声和动态环境挑战，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统户外健康监测方法依赖静态多模态深度学习框架，需要大量数据训练且难以捕捉细微变化；基于MLLM的方法虽能利用小数据集，但面临传感器噪声、多模态融合不鲁棒和缺失数据恢复不准确等挑战。

Method: 提出了一个不确定性感知的多模态融合框架DUAL-Health，包括模态不确定性量化、基于不确定性的融合权重定制和模态分布对齐。

Result: 实验证明DUAL-Health在检测准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DUAL-Health框架通过量化模态不确定性、定制融合权重和模态分布对齐，显著提升了动态嘈杂环境下的户外健康监测性能。

Abstract: Outdoor health monitoring is essential to detect early abnormal health status
for safeguarding human health and safety. Conventional outdoor monitoring
relies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive
data training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,
utilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models
for enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based
outdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data
contains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation
noise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor
environments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer
based MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design
for fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder
accurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,
named DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy
environments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify
modality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and
temporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with
low-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based
on quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from
fluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common
semantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种新型去噪方法，用于低剂量儿科X射线，通过结构感知设计保留诊断细节，显著提升肺炎分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源匮乏的环境中，低剂量X射线协议虽减少儿童辐射暴露，但引入的噪声会掩盖关键解剖细节，传统去噪方法常损害精细细节，影响诊断准确性。

Method: SharpXR结合了拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习的融合模块，自适应地平衡噪声抑制和结构细节保留。通过模拟泊松-高斯噪声在儿科肺炎胸部X射线数据集上进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上均优于现有基线方法，同时保持计算效率，去噪后的图像将肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，能够在去噪低剂量儿科X射线图像的同时保留诊断相关特征，显著提高了下游肺炎分类的准确性，适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

Motivation: 室内光照估计由于高度不适定性，尤其是在光照条件在空间和时间上变化时，仍是一个挑战。

Method: 利用2D扩散先验优化由MLP表示的光场，并通过微调预训练的图像扩散模型来实现零样本泛化。

Result: 在室内光照估计任务中，所提方法在单张图像或视频上的表现优于基线方法，并在处理野外视频时展现了空间和时间一致的光照估计能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在室内光照估计任务中表现出色，特别是在处理空间和时间变化的光照条件时，相较于基线方法具有显著优势。

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有面部表演重定向方法在语义识别和rig转换中的困难，尤其是在将表演重定向到游戏或虚拟现实角色时。

Method: 利用体积变形技术将面部rig适配到表演者和目标对象，并通过精心选择的Simon-Says表情集来校准每个rig。此外，提出了一种基于隐式微调的优化方法，以改进跟踪过程中的控制语义。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通过微调跟踪器使用的rig来促进更语义化的动画控制输出的方法，从而实现了高效的面部表演重定向。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either
another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)
environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and
retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same
framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does
not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to
another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when
retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to
fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen
set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion
signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of
Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,
we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says
expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character
rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions
when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these
well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a
performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned
inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry
reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig
used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically
meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order
to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit
differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially
non-differentiable) black box.

Motivation: 现有滤波方法常导致点聚类或噪声残留问题，HybridPF旨在通过结合短程和长程信息更精准地去除噪声。

Method: 设计了两个并行模块（ShortModule和LongModule），分别处理短程分数和长程流，并采用动态图卷积解码器优化推理过程。

Conclusion: HybridPF通过结合短程和长程滤波轨迹，显著提升了点云去噪的效果，并在保持快速推理速度的同时实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts
that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer
from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both
short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is
well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may
provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying
clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant
displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the
corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as
intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our
intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide
the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,
score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.
Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,
each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for
short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,
guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point
distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss
function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an
end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement
based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic
graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results
while enabling faster inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a study of computation and morphology of Louis Kahn City
Tower project. The City Tower is an unbuilt design by Louis I. Kahn and Anne
Tyng that integrates form and structure using 3D space triangular geometries.
Although never built, the City Tower geometrical framework anticipated later
developments in design of space-frame structures. Initially envisioned in the
1950s, the City Tower project is a skyscraper structure based on a tetrahedral
and octahedral space frame called Octet-Truss. The aim of this study is to
analyze the geometry of the City Tower structure and how it can be used to
develop modular and adaptable architectural forms. The study is based on an
analytical shape grammar that is used to recreate the original structure, and
later to generate new structural configurations based on the City Tower's
morphology. This study also investigates the potential applications of these
findings in architecture and reveals the possibilities of using tetrahedrons
and octahedrons as fundamental geometries for creating scalable and modular
designs and presents initial findings.

Abstract: This paper presents a study on using Radiolaria as a basis for generation of
space-based geometry for structural design with shape grammars. Radiolaria has
been a source of inspiration for architectural design with its intricate
structural features and geometric patterns (Lim, 2012). We use the basis of the
Radiolaria geometry to create a generative shape grammar as a computational
system; then use the shape grammar to create spatial configurations for
potential applications in design of 3D space structural frames. This study
begins with the geometric analysis of Radiolaria and the dissection of its
structure and geometry into a simplified morphological source, in this case a
tetrahedral structure. Tetrahedrons are used in combination with octahedrons to
generate spatial configurations to generate 3D spatial structural frames. The
paper presents the Radiolaria spatial analysis, the shape grammar, the
collection of generated designs, and possible applications in space frame
structures.

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen
substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object
colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize
color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models
struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire
image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not
explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to
enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate
guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the
effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation
methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate
this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and
conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the
model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more
controlled and refined colorization process.

Abstract: Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user
realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based
estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then
is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high
dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing
long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks
and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we
present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our
network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global
information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic
design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate
our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at
handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment
lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and
simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color
bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not
present in the training dataset.

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to
support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based
optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that
closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models
and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering
allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins,
facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual
cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical
artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real
transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage
pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key
optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world
data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse
rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture
optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance
in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin
of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics
environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using
images generated by DiffPhysCam.

Result: SCORE能够预测头部运动的动机和目标，适用于未见过的场景和多代理人群，保持行为合理性。

Conclusion: SCORE框架通过结合符号认知推理和视觉语言模型，成功生成了具有上下文感知的头部运动，提高了虚拟代理的逼真度。

Abstract: Natural head rotation is critical for believable embodied virtual agents, yet
this micro-level behavior remains largely underexplored. While head-rotation
prediction algorithms could, in principle, reproduce this behavior, they
typically focus on visually salient stimuli and overlook the cognitive motives
that guide head rotation. This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects
while overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a
virtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning
framework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces
context-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned
heuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers
of human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema,
and Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the
scene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large
Language Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM
reasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs
online validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness
to scene dynamics. The result is an agent that predicts not only where to look
but also why, generalizing to unseen scenes and multi-agent crowds while
retaining behavioral plausibility.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables

generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of

collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to

flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of

Conclusion: ColorCtrl在编辑质量和一致性上达到最先进水平，并展示出广泛适用性。

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

TL;DR: A multi-agent AI system combining intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized sub-agents significantly improves code generation accuracy and reliability in complex projects, outperforming single-agent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation
and software engineering tasks, yet they often struggle with complex,
multi-file projects due to context limitations and knowledge gaps. We propose a
novel context engineering workflow that combines multiple AI components: an
Intent Translator (GPT-5) for clarifying user requirements, an Elicit-powered
semantic literature retrieval for injecting domain knowledge, NotebookLM-based
document synthesis for contextual understanding, and a Claude Code multi-agent
system for code generation and validation. Our integrated approach leverages
intent clarification, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized
sub-agents orchestrated via Claude's agent framework. We demonstrate that this
method significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of code assistants
in real-world repositories, yielding higher single-shot success rates and
better adherence to project context than baseline single-agent approaches.
Qualitative results on a large Next.js codebase show the multi-agent system
effectively plans, edits, and tests complex features with minimal human
intervention. We compare our system with recent frameworks like CodePlan,
MASAI, and HyperAgent, highlighting how targeted context injection and agent
role decomposition lead to state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss
the implications for deploying LLM-based coding assistants in production, along
with lessons learned on context management and future research directions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现小型开源代码生成模型（SLMs）在52%以上的案例中能耗与大型商业模型（LLMs）相当或更低，尽管LLMs正确率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业模型如ChatGPT的高能耗和碳足迹引发了对环境影响的担忧。研究旨在探讨小型语言模型（SLMs）是否能在某些编程问题上匹配大型语言模型（LLMs）的性能，同时生成更节能的代码。

Method: 研究评估了150个来自LeetCode的编程问题，涵盖三个难度级别（简单、中等、困难），比较了三种小型开源模型（StableCode-3B、StarCoderBase-3B、Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct）和两种大型商业模型（GPT-4.0、DeepSeek-Reasoner）。生成的代码通过运行时间、内存使用、能耗和正确性四个关键指标进行评估。

Result: LLMs在所有难度级别上正确率最高，但SLMs在输出正确的情况下更节能。52%以上的问题中，SLMs的能耗与LLMs相当或更低。

Conclusion: 研究表明，虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）在所有难度级别上正确率最高，但在输出正确的情况下，小型语言模型（SLMs）通常更节能。在52%以上的评估问题中，SLMs的能耗与LLMs相当或更低。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation. However,
commercial models like ChatGPT require significant computing power, which leads
to high energy use and carbon emissions. This has raised concerns about their
environmental impact. In this study, we evaluate open-source Small Language
Models (SLMs) trained explicitly for code generation and compare their
performance and energy efficiency against large LLMs and efficient
human-written Python code. The goal is to investigate whether SLMs can match
the performance of LLMs on certain types of programming problems while
producing more energy-efficient code. We evaluate 150 coding problems from
LeetCode, evenly distributed across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and
hard. Our comparison includes three small open-source models, StableCode-3B,
StarCoderBase-3B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, and two large commercial
models, GPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-Reasoner. The generated code is evaluated using
four key metrics: run-time, memory usage, energy consumption, and correctness.
We use human-written solutions as a baseline to assess the quality and
efficiency of the model-generated code. Results indicate that LLMs achieve the
highest correctness across all difficulty levels, but SLMs are often more
energy-efficient when their outputs are correct. In over 52% of the evaluated
problems, SLMs consumed the same or less energy than LLMs.

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于预测的PR排序方法显著优于传统的FIFO和非学习型排序策略，且不依赖于特定构建系统，易于集成到现有自动化合并流程中。

Abstract: Integrating changes into large monolithic software repositories is a critical
step in modern software development that substantially impacts the speed of
feature delivery, the stability of the codebase, and the overall productivity
of development teams. To ensure the stability of the main branch, many
organizations use merge pipelines that test software versions before the
changes are permanently integrated. However, the load on merge pipelines is
often so high that they become bottlenecks, despite the use of parallelization.
Existing optimizations frequently rely on specific build systems, limiting
their generalizability and applicability. In this paper we propose to optimize
the order of PRs in merge pipelines using practical build predictions utilizing
only historical build data, PR metadata, and contextual information to estimate
the likelihood of successful builds in the merge pipeline. By dynamically
prioritizing likely passing PRs during peak hours, this approach maximizes
throughput when it matters most. Experiments conducted on a real-world,
large-scale project demonstrate that predictive ordering significantly
outperforms traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO), as well as
non-learning-based ordering strategies. Unlike alternative optimizations, this
approach is agnostic to the underlying build system and thus easily integrable
into existing automated merge pipelines.

TL;DR: OmniLLP通过聚类代码语义和开发者所有权，提升基于LLM的日志级别预测准确性，AUC最高达0.96。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的日志级别预测器依赖随机选择的上下文示例，忽略了现代软件项目中的结构和多样化日志实践。

Method: 提出OmniLLP框架，通过聚类源文件（基于语义相似性和开发者所有权一致性）来为LLM提供更连贯的上下文学习示例。

Result: 语义和所有权感知的聚类显著提高了预测准确性（AUC提升高达8%），结合两者的方法在评估项目中达到0.88至0.96的AUC。

Conclusion: 研究发现，将代码语义和开发者所有权信号整合到基于LLM的日志级别预测器中，可以显著提高预测准确性，从而增强系统的可维护性和可观测性。

Abstract: Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant
runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log
level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it
controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and
performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged
large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that
demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8).
Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context
examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within
modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP
enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic
similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer
ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from
these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent
prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.
Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings
statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the
evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging
randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally,
our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context
prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated
projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software
engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership
signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware
approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and
observability.

Abstract: Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks
in software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from
hallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural
language and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes
which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains
largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of
hallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language
generation: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We
quantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore
a range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings
reveal that approximately 50\% of generated code reviews and 20\% of generated
commit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak
detectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves
performance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics
effectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for
inference-time detection.\footnote{All code and data will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 现有需求质量研究的数据集往往不可访问、规模小或缺乏细节，限制了研究的可靠性和协作性。

Method: 介绍了QuRE数据集，包括其来源（2,111条工业需求，经过真实审查流程标注）、描述性统计（如词汇多样性和可读性），并与现有数据集和合成需求进行了比较。

Result: QuRE在语言上与现有数据集相似，但提供了详细的上下文描述和长期工业实践中系统生成的标签。

Conclusion: QuRE数据集通过提供一个真实且标注详细的工业需求数据集，旨在促进需求质量研究的透明性、可比性和实证严谨性，支持建立一个共同的金标准。

Abstract: Requirements quality is central to successful software and systems
engineering. Empirical research on quality defects in natural language
requirements relies heavily on datasets, ideally as realistic and
representative as possible. However, such datasets are often inaccessible,
small, or lack sufficient detail. This paper introduces QuRE (Quality in
Requirements), a new dataset comprising 2,111 industrial requirements that have
been annotated through a real-world review process. Previously used for over
five years as part of an industrial contract, this dataset is now being
released to the research community. In this work, we furthermore provide
descriptive statistics on the dataset, including measures such as lexical
diversity and readability, and compare it to existing requirements datasets and
synthetically generated requirements. In contrast to synthetic datasets, QuRE
is linguistically similar to existing ones. However, this dataset comes with a
detailed context description, and its labels have been created and used
systematically and extensively in an industrial context over a period of close
to a decade. Our goal is to foster transparency, comparability, and empirical
rigor by supporting the development of a common gold standard for requirements
quality datasets. This, in turn, will enable more sound and collaborative
research efforts in the field.

Motivation: 减少软件维护和演化成本需要软件故障数据集以及对故障的理解，以优化测试和评估。

Method: 对16个开源Java和Python项目中的故障进行了实证分析，这些项目分别来自Defects4J和BugsInPy数据集。

Result: 研究发现许多故障长期存在且共存于多个版本中，且故障在系统中分布均匀，错误热点较少。

Conclusion: 研究发现，软件系统中的许多故障长期存在，导致大多数软件版本中存在多个共存的故障，这与原始数据集的假设（大多数版本仅识别单个故障）形成对比。此外，尽管故障仅出现在系统的一小部分中，但这些故障通常在该子集中均匀分布，导致相对较少的错误热点。

Abstract: Fixing software faults contributes significantly to the cost of software
maintenance and evolution. Techniques for reducing these costs require datasets
of software faults, as well as an understanding of the faults, for optimal
testing and evaluation. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the
temporal and spatial characteristics of faults existing in 16 open-source Java
and Python projects, which form part of the Defects4J and BugsInPy datasets,
respectively. Our findings show that many faults in these software systems are
long-lived, leading to the majority of software versions having multiple
coexisting faults. This is in contrast to the assumptions of the original
datasets, where the majority of versions only identify a single fault. In
addition, we show that although the faults are found in only a small subset of
the systems, these faults are often evenly distributed amongst this subset,
leading to relatively few bug hotspots.

Conclusion: 论文提出的自动化场景生成框架通过优化虚拟机资源配置，显著提高了汽车行业集成效率并缩短了开发时间。

Abstract: In the automotive industry, the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) has
  driven a shift toward virtualization-based architectures that consolidate
  diverse automotive workloads on a shared hardware platform. To support this
  evolution, chipset vendors provide board support packages (BSPs), hypervisor
  setups, and resource allocation guidelines. However, adapting these static
  configurations to varying system requirements and workloads remain a
  significant challenge for Tier 1 integrators.
  This paper presents an automated scenario generation framework, which helps
  automotive vendors to allocate hardware resources efficiently across multiple
  VMs. By profiling runtime behavior and integrating both theoretical models
and
  vendor heuristics, the proposed tool generates optimized hypervisor
  configurations tailored to system constraints.
  We compare two main approaches for modeling target QoS based on profiled data
  and resource allocation: domain-guided parametric modeling and deep
  learning-based modeling. We further describe our optimization strategy using
  the selected QoS model to derive efficient resource allocations. Finally, we
  report on real-world deployments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  framework in improving integration efficiency and reducing development time
in
  resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Endowing humanoid robots with the ability to perform highly dynamic motions
akin to human-level acrobatics has been a long-standing challenge. Successfully
performing these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying
physics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during
execution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high
degree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,
which makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical
workarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,
neither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true
robotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising
trajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching
model abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including
constraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of
motion of the articulated rigid body model. A review of underlying modeling and
control methods is given, followed by implementation details including model
abstraction, trajectory optimization and whole-body controller. The system's
effectiveness is analyzed in simulation.

Conclusion: 本文通过应用Koopman算子理论于四足机器人的线性模型预测控制（LMPC），首次实现了在高维空间中保持运动方程非线性的线性建模，显著提升了跟踪精度和抗干扰能力。

Abstract: Online optimal control of quadruped robots would enable them to adapt to
varying inputs and changing conditions in real time. A common way of achieving
this is linear model predictive control (LMPC), where a quadratic programming
(QP) problem is formulated over a finite horizon with a quadratic cost and
linear constraints obtained by linearizing the equations of motion and solved
on the fly. However, the model linearization may lead to model inaccuracies. In
this paper, we use the Koopman operator to create a linear model of the
quadrupedal system in high dimensional space which preserves the nonlinearity
of the equations of motion. Then using LMPC, we demonstrate high fidelity
tracking and disturbance rejection on a quadrupedal robot. This is the first
work that uses the Koopman operator theory for LMPC of quadrupedal locomotion.

Motivation: IFP在多机器人路径规划中计算轻量、可扩展且反应迅速，但在对称配置下容易发生碰撞和死锁，需要优化以提升鲁棒性和路径一致性。

Method: eIFP-MPC改进了IFP，通过时间到碰撞启发式优化威胁优先级，基于成本的路径点选择稳定路径生成，并整合模型预测控制（MPC）确保动态可行性。

Result: 仿真显示eIFP-MPC显著减少振荡，确保无碰撞运动并提升轨迹效率。

Conclusion: 几何规划器（如eIFP-MPC）通过优化可以增强性能，在复杂多智能体环境中实现稳健的规模化表现。

Abstract: The Iterative Forecast Planner (IFP) is a geometric planning approach that
offers lightweight computations, scalable, and reactive solutions for
multi-robot path planning in decentralized, communication-free settings.
However, it struggles in symmetric configurations, where mirrored interactions
often lead to collisions and deadlocks. We introduce eIFP-MPC, an optimized and
extended version of IFP that improves robustness and path consistency in dense,
dynamic environments. The method refines threat prioritization using a
time-to-collision heuristic, stabilizes path generation through cost-based
via-point selection, and ensures dynamic feasibility by incorporating model
predictive control (MPC) into the planning process. These enhancements are
tightly integrated into the IFP to preserve its efficiency while improving its
adaptability and stability. Extensive simulations across symmetric and
high-density scenarios show that eIFP-MPC significantly reduces oscillations,
ensures collision-free motion, and improves trajectory efficiency. The results
demonstrate that geometric planners can be strengthened through optimization,
enabling robust performance at scale in complex multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation
tasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique
challenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a
direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon
controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,
visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and
inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface
electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to
capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a
significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and
regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic
hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193
subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset
incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,
addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three
baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a
novel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG
recordings. This dataset and modeling framework marks a significant step
forward for tendon-driven dexterous robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork
for scalable and accurate tendon control in robotic hands.

for grasping in unstructured, dynamic environments through coordinated
whole-body control. However, existing research has predominantly focused on
static-object grasping, neglecting the challenges posed by dynamic targets and
thus limiting applicability in dynamic scenarios such as logistics sorting and
human-robot collaboration. To address this, we introduce DQ-Bench, a new
benchmark that systematically evaluates dynamic grasping across varying object
motions, velocities, heights, object types, and terrain complexities, along
with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Building upon this benchmark, we propose
DQ-Net, a compact teacher-student framework designed to infer grasp
configurations from limited perceptual cues. During training, the teacher
network leverages privileged information to holistically model both the static
geometric properties and dynamic motion characteristics of the target, and
integrates a grasp fusion module to deliver robust guidance for motion
planning. Concurrently, we design a lightweight student network that performs
dual-viewpoint temporal modeling using only the target mask, depth map, and
proprioceptive state, enabling closed-loop action outputs without reliance on
privileged data. Extensive experiments on DQ-Bench demonstrate that DQ-Net
achieves robust dynamic objects grasping across multiple task settings,
substantially outperforming baseline methods in both success rate and
responsiveness.

*Hossein B. Jond*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新模型，通过相对位置、速度和局部密度调控智能体动态，解决了现有模型在碰撞避免和灵活性上的不足，适用于自主空中蜂群。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如Vicsek、Cucker-Smale和Olfati-Saber）在碰撞避免或形成灵活性方面存在不足，限制了其在群体机器人中的适用性。

Method: 提出了一种基于相对位置、速度和局部密度的最小但表达力强的模型，通过两个可调参数（空间偏移和动能偏移）来调控智能体动态。

Result: 模型实现了空间灵活且无碰撞的行为，反映了自然群体动态，并扩展至认知自主系统，实现了能量感知的相变。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的模型为多机器人系统，特别是自主空中蜂群提供了稳健的基础，通过自适应控制参数调整实现了能量感知的相变。

Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming and flocking emerge from simple,
decentralized interactions in biological systems. Existing models, such as
Vicsek and Cucker-Smale, lack collision avoidance, whereas the Olfati-Saber
model imposes rigid formations, limiting their applicability in swarm robotics.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes a minimal yet expressive
model that governs agent dynamics using relative positions, velocities, and
local density, modulated by two tunable parameters: the spatial offset and
kinetic offset. The model achieves spatially flexible, collision-free behaviors
that reflect naturalistic group dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the framework
to cognitive autonomous systems, enabling energy-aware phase transitions
between swarming and flocking through adaptive control parameter tuning. This
cognitively inspired approach offers a robust foundation for real-world
applications in multi-robot systems, particularly autonomous aerial swarms.

Motivation: 动物形态机器人作为宠物替代品的情感交互通常简单且短暂，限制了其家庭应用的潜力。AZRA旨在通过AR技术提升其情感交互的动态性和细腻度。

Method: 提出AZRA框架，通过AR技术增强动物形态机器人（如Petit Qoobo）的情感表达（面部、灯光、声音、思想气泡）和交互方式（语音、触摸、距离、视线），并结合情感计算模型实现情感响应、日常情绪、个性发展和需求模拟。

Conclusion: AZRA框架通过增强现实技术扩展了动物形态机器人的情感交互能力，无需物理修改，为未来动物形态机器人的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Zoomorphic robots could serve as accessible and practical alternatives for
users unable or unwilling to keep pets. However, their affective interactions
are often simplistic and short-lived, limiting their potential for domestic
adoption. In order to facilitate more dynamic and nuanced affective
interactions and relationships between users and zoomorphic robots we present
AZRA, a novel augmented reality (AR) framework that extends the affective
capabilities of these robots without physical modifications. To demonstrate
AZRA, we augment a zoomorphic robot, Petit Qoobo, with novel emotional displays
(face, light, sound, thought bubbles) and interaction modalities (voice, touch,
proximity, gaze). Additionally, AZRA features a computational model of emotion
to calculate the robot's emotional responses, daily moods, evolving personality
and needs. We highlight how AZRA can be used for rapid participatory
prototyping and enhancing existing robots, then discuss implications on future
zoomorphic robot development.

Result: RC和GF模型在预测任务中表现最优，且能有效利用更大规模的仓库操作数据集。

Conclusion: DeepFleet的机器人中心（RC）和图地面（GF）模型在预测任务中表现最佳，尤其是在异步机器人状态更新和局部交互结构方面。这些模型在大规模仓库操作数据集上的扩展也显示出有效性。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFleet, a suite of foundation models designed to support
coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets. These models are
trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and
interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses
worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct
inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for
multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an
autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual
robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention
between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies
convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full
fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph
neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these
models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on
prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor
models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the
localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also
present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of
larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.

wheel loader. It uses a physics-based multibody dynamic model of the wheel
loader in the software AGX Dynamics. Interactions of the wheel loader's bucket
while in use in construction can be simulated in the virtual model. Calibration
makes this simulation of high-fidelity which can enhance realistic planning for

instrumented with several sensors used to calibrate the digital model. The
calibrated digital twin was able to estimate the magnitude of the forces on the
bucket base with high accuracy, providing a high-fidelity simulation.

Conclusion: GSMR 和 GSCLO 方法在轮式和腿式机器人上均显著优于现有基准，首次实现了超低通信成本的 RoboMR，并证明动态场景中数据混合对提升 GS 性能有益。

Abstract: Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems
presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images
through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR
(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a
photo-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS
model, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS
model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this
end, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which
jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or
not) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across
different frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO
problem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm
that reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional
branch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are
presented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method
achieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and
legged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios. For the first
time, it is found that RoboMR can be achieved with ultra-low communication
costs, and mixture of data is useful for enhancing GS performance in dynamic
scenarios.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicles (UAAVs) can operate both in the air and
underwater, giving them broad application prospects. Inspired by the
dual-function wings of puffins, we propose a UAAV with amphibious wings to
address the challenge posed by medium differences on the vehicle's propulsion
system. The amphibious wing, redesigned based on a fixed-wing structure,
features a single degree of freedom in pitch and requires no additional
components. It can generate lift in the air and function as a flapping wing for
propulsion underwater, reducing disturbance to marine life and making it
environmentally friendly. Additionally, an artificial central pattern generator
(CPG) is introduced to enhance the smoothness of the flapping motion. This
paper presents the prototype, design details, and practical implementation of
this concept.

Method: 提出OmniVTLA架构，采用双路径触觉编码框架，结合预训练的视觉变换器（ViT）和语义对齐的触觉ViT（SA-ViT），并利用新构建的ObjTac数据集训练触觉编码器。

Result: 在真实实验中，OmniVTLA在抓取任务中成功率显著提升（夹爪96.9%，灵巧手100%），并减少了任务完成时间和生成更流畅的轨迹。

Conclusion: OmniVTLA通过引入触觉感知显著提升了视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在接触密集型任务中的表现，实现了更高的成功率和更流畅的操作轨迹。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models build upon vision-language
foundations, and have achieved promising results and exhibit the possibility of
task generalization in robot manipulation. However, due to the heterogeneity of
tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA
models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in
contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a
novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions
are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder
framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse
vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision
transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we
introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing
textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories.
With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile
datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned
tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better
initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial
improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates
with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with
dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides,
OmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother
trajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.

Motivation: 当前深度生成模型（如扩散和流动匹配模型）在模仿学习中表现优异，但在复杂障碍环境中的生成运动安全性被忽视。

Method: 提出 Potential Field-Guided Flow Matching Policy (PF2MP) 方法，通过从成功演示中学习任务策略和障碍信息（表示为势场），在推理时通过势场调节流动匹配向量场。

Result: 实验结果表明，PF2MP 在仿真和真实环境中均能显著减少碰撞，提高安全性，同时不影响任务成功率。

Conclusion: PF2MP 通过结合流动匹配和势场引导，显著提高了运动生成的安全性，为复杂障碍环境中的安全运动生成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Deep generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching models, have
recently shown remarkable potential in learning complex policies through
imitation learning. However, the safety of generated motions remains
overlooked, particularly in complex environments with inherent obstacles. In
this work, we address this critical gap by proposing Potential Field-Guided
Flow Matching Policy (PF2MP), a novel approach that simultaneously learns task
policies and extracts obstacle-related information, represented as a potential
field, from the same set of successful demonstrations. During inference, PF2MP
modulates the flow matching vector field via the learned potential field,
enabling safe motion generation. By leveraging these complementary fields, our
approach achieves improved safety without compromising task success across
diverse environments, such as navigation tasks and robotic manipulation
scenarios. We evaluate PF2MP in both simulation and real-world settings,
demonstrating its effectiveness in task space and joint space control.
Experimental results demonstrate that PF2MP enhances safety, achieving a
significant reduction of collisions compared to baseline policies. This work
paves the way for safer motion generation in unstructured and obstaclerich
environments.

Motivation: 现有的直接从无标签视频演示中学习的方法往往编码的隐式动作与真实动作之间的互信息较少，导致控制性能不佳。

Method: 引入了一个新颖的框架，通过变分信息瓶颈（variational information-bottleneck）来提取与动作相关的表示，同时丢弃任务无关的信息。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人环境中的实验表明，该方法显著增强了互信息并持续提升了策略性能。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了所提出的方法能够有效提升隐式动作与真实动作之间的互信息，从而显著提高策略性能。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations (LfD) typically relies on large amounts of
action-labeled expert trajectories, which fundamentally constrains the scale of
available training data. A promising alternative is to learn directly from
unlabeled video demonstrations. However, we find that existing methods tend to
encode latent actions that share little mutual information with the true robot
actions, leading to suboptimal control performance. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel framework that explicitly maximizes the mutual information
between latent actions and true actions, even in the absence of action labels.
Our method leverage the variational information-bottleneck to extract
action-relevant representations while discarding task-irrelevant information.
We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our objective indeed maximizes
the mutual information between latent and true actions. Finally, we validate
our approach through extensive experiments: first in simulated robotic
environments and then on real-world robotic platforms, the experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances mutual information and
consistently improves policy performance.

Abstract: Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and
adaptability in retail environments.

Motivation: 研究机器人代理是否能通过处理社会等级关系来减少上级的支配性并均衡讨论中的参与。

Method: 采用干预实验，比较了三种策略：基于社会等级的机器人鼓励、平等干预和无行动。机器人通过后续动作（如反馈）和鼓励动作（如提示发言）来均衡参与。

Result: 机器人的行为可能影响发言时间，但未显示显著差异。然而，结果表明可以在不降低上级满意度的情况下影响发言时间。

Conclusion: 在具有等级结构的讨论中，通过控制机器人的反馈行为可能抑制上级的支配性并均衡参与。

Abstract: This study investigated whether robotic agents that deal with social
hierarchical relationships can reduce the dominance of superiors and equalize
participation among participants in discussions with hierarchical structures.
Thirty doctors and students having hierarchical relationship were gathered as
participants, and an intervention experiment was conducted using a robot that
can encourage participants to speak depending on social hierarchy. These were
compared with strategies that intervened equally for all participants without
considering hierarchy and with a no-action. The robots performed follow
actions, showing backchanneling to speech, and encourage actions, prompting
speech from members with less speaking time, on the basis of the hierarchical
relationships among group members to equalize participation. The experimental
results revealed that the robot's actions could potentially influence the
speaking time among members, but it could not be conclusively stated that there
were significant differences between the robot's action conditions. However,
the results suggested that it might be possible to influence speaking time
without decreasing the satisfaction of superiors. This indicates that in
discussion scenarios where experienced superiors are likely to dominate,
controlling the robot's backchanneling behavior could potentially suppress
dominance and equalize participation among group members.

Motivation: 现有方法过于关注低层次抓取稳定性指标，忽视了功能感知定位和人化姿势对下游操作的重要性，AffordDex旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: AffordDex采用两阶段训练框架：第一阶段通过大量人类手部运动数据预训练轨迹模仿器，注入自然运动的强先验；第二阶段通过残差模块将通用人化运动适配到特定物体实例，并引入负功能感知分割（NAA）模块和特权师生蒸馏过程。

Conclusion: AffordDex显著优于现有基线方法，在已知物体、未见实例甚至全新类别上均表现出色，实现了通用灵巧抓取，同时保持了高度人化的姿势和功能适当的接触位置。

Abstract: A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for
the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus
narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware
positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation.
To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with
two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent
understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage,
a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to
instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual
module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object
instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative
Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally
inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation
process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal
dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and
functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects,
unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.

Result: SDAX使四足机器人能够学习高度敏捷的行为，包括爬行、攀爬、跳跃和执行复杂动作（如从垂直墙壁跳下）。

Conclusion: SDAX框架成功地将学习到的策略部署到实际硬件上，验证了其在现实世界中的适用性。

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion
behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is
inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,
expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit
generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration
(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering
effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a
diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate
the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization
process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate
that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors
including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as
jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real
hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

*Ben Zandonati,Tomás Lozano-Pérez,Leslie Pack Kaelbling*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RIR框架通过贝叶斯程序归纳和视觉语言模型，实现了机器人在少量演示下的高效泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人因无法恢复智能行为的潜在解释而难以泛化的问题，这些解释可表现为由高级目标、子任务分解和执行约束组成的结构化程序。

Method: 提出Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR)框架，通过贝叶斯程序归纳和视觉语言模型迭代生成结构化符号任务假设，结合规划器评分机制。

Result: RIR在连续操作任务中，仅需一次演示即可推断任务结构并泛化至新场景，性能优于现有基线。

Conclusion: RIR框架通过层次生成模型推断潜在程序，显著提升了机器人在少量演示下的泛化能力，优于现有视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately
generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often
require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the
training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to
recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that
these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of
high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this
work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring
these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR
frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language
model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a
planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the
observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over
concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous
manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across
variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one
demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel
settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.

Motivation: 机器人表达行为对于在与人类互动中有效传达其情感状态至关重要。

Method: 通过专家以第一人称视角远程操作虚拟机器人，捕捉其面部表情、头部动作和上半身手势，并将这些行为映射到机器人的相应组件上。利用基于流匹配的生成过程，模型学习在实时响应移动物体时，根据给定的情感状态生成连贯且多样的行为。

Abstract: Expressive behaviors in robots are critical for effectively conveying their
emotional states during interactions with humans. In this work, we present a
framework that autonomously generates realistic and diverse robotic emotional
expressions based on expert human demonstrations captured in Mixed Reality
(MR). Our system enables experts to teleoperate a virtual robot from a
first-person perspective, capturing their facial expressions, head movements,
and upper-body gestures, and mapping these behaviors onto corresponding robotic
components including eyes, ears, neck, and arms. Leveraging a
flow-matching-based generative process, our model learns to produce coherent
and varied behaviors in real-time in response to moving objects, conditioned
explicitly on given emotional states. A preliminary test validated the
effectiveness of our approach for generating autonomous expressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模物料搬运是重复性、劳动密集且安全关键的操作，目前主要依赖人工操作，存在效率和安全问题。

Method: 系统集成了环境感知、堆料攻击点选择、路径规划和运动控制模块，并引入了两个基于强化学习的模块：攻击点规划器和轨迹跟踪控制器。

Result: 在40吨物料搬运设备上的实际实验中，系统在吞吐量和精度方面均优于人工操作，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了全规模物料搬运任务的完整自动化，通过强化学习模块显著提升了效率和安全性。

Abstract: Bulk material handling involves the efficient and precise moving of large
quantities of materials, a core operation in many industries, including cargo
ship unloading, waste sorting, construction, and demolition. These repetitive,
labor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using
large hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this
work, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of
large-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules
for environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and
motion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement
learning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping
locations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the
number of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses
the precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in
movement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material
through dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world
experiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing
on two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck
loading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational
safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete automation of
material handling tasks on a full scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型主要依赖2D视觉输入，忽略了3D几何信息，限制了空间感知和适应性。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型处理2D图像和语言指令，同时通过定制的点编码器处理深度图生成的3D点云，最后通过空间感知动作专家整合多模态信息生成精确动作序列。

Result: 在LIBERO和ManiSkill2仿真基准测试中达到最先进水平，并在需要高度适应性、尺度感知和视角不变性的真实任务中表现出显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GeoVLA通过整合3D几何信息显著提升了机器人操作的空间感知和适应性，在仿真和真实环境中均表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising approach for
enabling robots to follow language instructions and predict corresponding
actions.However, current VLA models mainly rely on 2D visual inputs, neglecting
the rich geometric information in the 3D physical world, which limits their
spatial awareness and adaptability. In this paper, we present GeoVLA, a novel
VLA framework that effectively integrates 3D information to advance robotic
manipulation. It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process images and
language instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings. In parallel,
it converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized point
encoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric embeddings
independently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and processed by
our proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced Action Expert,
which combines information from different sensor modalities to produce precise
action sequences. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior performance and
robustness. It achieves state-of-the-art results in the LIBERO and ManiSkill2
simulation benchmarks and shows remarkable robustness in real-world tasks
requiring height adaptability, scale awareness and viewpoint invariance.

TL;DR: 论文提出基于拓扑理论的LLM新型架构，利用范畴论构造组合结构，证明LLM类别形成拓扑，并探讨了实现方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer模型作为通用序列到序列函数逼近器的理论结果，探索利用LLM类别作为拓扑的性质，构建新型组合结构的LLM架构。

Method: 利用范畴论中的普遍构造（如拉回、推出、（共）等化子、指数对象和子对象分类器）构建新型LLM架构，并通过理论验证LLM类别的（共）完备性及其拓扑性质。

Result: 证明了LLM类别是（共）完备的，并形成一个拓扑，从而为新型LLM架构提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型分类生成AI架构（GAIAs），证明了LLM类别形成一个拓扑（一种“类似集合”的类别），并通过函子化反向传播定义了潜在的LLM拓扑架构实现。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果模型（如SCMs）在复杂因果图解析和干预方面存在局限性，TCMs旨在通过范畴论工具解决这些问题。

Method: 提出TCMs，利用topos范畴的（共）完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象特性，构建因果模型，并证明其范畴的（共）完备性。

Result: 证明了TCMs范畴的（共）完备性，展示了如何利用（共）极限、子对象分类器和指数对象进行因果干预、等价类推理及内部逻辑表达。

Conclusion: TCMs（topos因果模型）通过利用topos范畴的关键特性，为因果推理提供了强大的数学框架，支持复杂的因果图解析、干预和等价类推理。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高度约束的多目标问题时，现代多目标算法往往难以获得良好的近似解集，而问题实例间存在适应度景观的相似性，可以利用这一特性提高效率。

Method: 提出了一种方法，通过使用计算昂贵的多目标算法解决一个问题实例以获得良好的近似解集，然后利用目标规划和高效的单目标算法解决同一问题场景的其他实例。

Result: 在具有时间窗的多目标车辆路径问题的基准实例上，该方法能够在较短的计算时间内产生良好的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了前沿多目标算法的有效性和目标规划的高效性，能够在具有相似适应度景观的问题场景中快速找到良好的折中解。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

Motivation: 贝叶斯推理的广泛应用面临一个主要障碍：先验分布和似然的设定通常需要专业的统计知识。本文探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLM）自动化这一过程的可行性。

Method: 论文提出了LLM-BI（大型语言模型驱动的贝叶斯推理）的概念流程，并通过两个实验（贝叶斯线性回归）验证其可行性：实验I展示了LLM从自然语言中成功提取先验分布的能力，实验II则证明LLM可以从高层问题描述中指定整个模型结构（包括先验和似然）。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM能够成功地从自然语言中提取先验分布，并能够根据高层问题描述指定完整的模型结构，验证了LLMs在自动化贝叶斯建模中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该论文验证了LLMs在自动化贝叶斯建模关键步骤中的潜力，提出了LLM-BI的概念框架，为概率编程的自动化推理流程提供了可能性。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在用户提供信息不完整或模糊时回答质量低的问题，强调信息完整性和用户参与。

Method: 提出FATA交互范式，通过提示词引导LLMs在生成回答前主动生成补充问题，并整合用户反馈。采用单轮策略一次性生成所有澄清问题。

Result: 实验显示FATA在综合指标上优于基线提示约40%，变异系数比专家提示低8%，表现出更高的稳定性和效率。

Conclusion: FATA交互范式通过引导LLMs主动生成多维补充问题并整合用户反馈，显著提升了回答质量和相关性，且在效率和稳定性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

Motivation: 现有评估实践不足，基准测试中的问题可直接通过知识图谱中的三元组回答，且评估指标不一致、答案匹配标准宽松，难以进行有意义的比较。

Method: 提出了一种构建基准测试的通用方法及评估协议，用于系统评估知识不完整情况下的KG-RAG方法。

Result: 实证结果表明，当前KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，常依赖内部记忆，泛化能力因设计不同而异。

Conclusion: 当前的知识图谱增强生成方法（KG-RAG）在知识不完整的情况下推理能力有限，往往依赖内部记忆，且泛化能力因设计而异。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卡牌游戏的部分可观测性、长期决策和动态卡牌池特性，当前AI模型在卡牌游戏任务（如组牌和游戏玩法）上表现远逊于人类玩家。

Method: 通过Low-Rank Adaptation（LoRA）微调技术，基于标注的卡牌游戏日志数据集对开源LLM进行适配，使其能够快速适应不同游戏扩展包。

Result: UrzaGPT在零样本LLMs和领域专用模型的对比中表现优异，微调后的小型模型（如Llama-3-8B）在仅10,000步训练后达到66.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 使用LLMs（如UrzaGPT）进行卡牌游戏AI设计是可行的，未来可以实现高性能、通用且易于更新的AI系统。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

Conclusion: 通过引入双层MCTS和树折叠技术，显著提升了MCTS在经典规划问题中的效率，实现了节点选择的O(1)时间复杂度。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

Motivation: 传统方法在编译过程中会生成所有归纳变量的组合，并通过部分求值丢弃那些简化为关联-交换操作恒等元的组合，这在大多数组合最终无关的问题中效率低下。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过使用求解器仅计算生成最终约束集所需的组合，从而避免了完全枚举，显著提高了编译效率。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

TL;DR: OverFill通过解耦预填充和解码阶段优化LLM推理，性能显著优于传统剪枝模型，且减少训练数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理时面临高成本问题，尤其是解码阶段对长序列的延迟影响显著。当前模型对预填充和解码阶段采用统一处理，未能充分利用其不同的计算特性。

Method: OverFill提出了一种解耦预填充和解码阶段的方法，预填充阶段使用完整模型并行处理输入，解码阶段则切换到密集剪枝模型进行序列生成。

Result: 3B到1B的OverFill配置比1B剪枝模型性能提升83.2%，8B到3B配置比3B剪枝模型提升79.2%。OverFill在性能上媲美从头训练的同规模模型，但训练数据需求显著降低。

Conclusion: OverFill通过解耦预填充和解码阶段，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理效率，同时在生成质量上优于传统的剪枝模型，且训练数据需求更低。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our

*Joan Salvà Soler,Grégoire de Lambertye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种GRASP元启发式算法，有效解决动态弧成本的TA-TSP问题，在竞赛和合成数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TA-TSP扩展了经典TSP，引入动态弧成本以模拟实际场景（如仓库操作中的可压缩存储系统），需要高效的算法来解决此类问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于GRASP的元启发式算法，结合了多种构造启发式和多邻域局部搜索。构造阶段使用混合整数规划（MIP）技术将TA-TSP转化为一系列定制的TSP实例，改进阶段则应用2-Opt、Swap和Relocate操作符。

Result: 在MESS 2024竞赛实例上，平均最优性差距为0.77%和0.40%；在合成数据集上，解决方案比Gurobi求解器优11.3%。算法在MESS 2024中排名前三。

Conclusion: 该算法在MESS 2024竞赛中表现优异，证明了其在实时路由应用中的适用性，特别是在具有状态依赖旅行成本的场景中。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出序数偏好数据的局限性，提出基数反馈方法，实验证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于序数比较的LLM对齐技术存在根本性局限，无法系统性地恢复最优模型，因为序数数据缺乏解决权衡所需的信息。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于基数反馈的偏好微调方法，通过收集25,000条基数判断数据（使用愿意付费的评估方法）来优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，引入基数反馈的偏好微调方法能够优先考虑高影响力改进，并在下游基准（如Arena-Hard）中优于仅依赖序数的方法。

Conclusion: 论文证明，仅依赖序数比较的算法无法系统地恢复最优模型，而通过引入基数反馈（如愿意付费的评估）可以显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

Motivation: 尽管本体对齐系统众多，但在高精度映射需求的应用中，人工参与成本高且效率低，因此探索LLM作为替代方案的可行性。

Method: 通过多个本体对齐评估倡议（OAEI）的匹配任务，评估了多种最先进的LLM在不同本体驱动提示模板下的性能，并与不同错误率的模拟Oracle进行了比较。

Result: LLM在验证不确定对应关系时表现良好，接近模拟Oracle的效果，尤其是在特定提示模板下。

Conclusion: 使用大型语言模型（LLM）验证本体对齐系统中不确定的对应关系是可行的，且在特定条件下表现接近模拟Oracle的效果。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

Result: 零样本评估揭示了LLMs在空间推理和基础规划方面的持续局限性，包括空间和逻辑错误。部分干预措施（如结构化提示和空间接地技术）带来了有限的改进。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM提供了一个可重复的测试平台，用于推进语言模型能力的研究，特别是在代理行为和上下文推理方面。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: SynLLM框架利用20种LLMs和结构化提示生成高质量合成医疗数据，通过多维度评估证明其临床合理性和隐私保护性，为医疗数据共享提供了新方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私法规的限制，真实医疗数据的获取受限，阻碍了医疗研究的进展。合成数据是一个有前景的替代方案，但生成既真实又保护隐私的记录仍是一个主要挑战。

Method: SynLLM是一个模块化框架，利用20种先进的开放源代码LLMs（如LLaMA、Mistral和GPT变体），通过结构化提示生成高质量的合成医疗表格数据。提出了四种不同的提示类型，从示例驱动到基于规则的约束，编码模式、元数据和领域知识，以控制生成而无需模型微调。

Result: 在三个公共医疗数据集（糖尿病、肝硬化和中风）上评估SynLLM，结果显示提示工程显著影响数据质量和隐私风险，基于规则的提示在隐私与质量之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: SynLLM通过精心设计的提示和全面的评估标准，证明了LLMs能够生成既符合临床逻辑又保护隐私的合成医疗数据，为医疗研究中的数据共享提供了更安全有效的途径。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

Motivation: 传统网格移动方法计算复杂度高且几何灵活性不足，而现有监督学习方法在零样本泛化方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出了一种无监督和可泛化的网格移动网络（UGM2N），通过局部几何特征学习和物理约束的M-Uniform损失函数实现网格节点的动态调整。

Result: 实验结果表明UGM2N在高效网格适应中表现出方程无关的泛化能力和几何独立性，优于现有方法，并支持多尺度分辨率和无网格纠缠的误差减少。

Conclusion: UGM2N展示了在无需预适应网格的情况下，通过无监督学习和物理约束损失函数，实现了跨多样PDE和网格拓扑的高效网格适应，且在精度和效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出diminution概念，通过选择Herbrand子集简化ground程序，实验显示显著提升ASP性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP常因grounding瓶颈（大Herbrand宇宙生成庞大的ground程序）而受阻，现有方法多依赖临时启发式策略，缺乏形式化和通用性。

Method: 提出了diminution的概念，通过选择Herbrand universe的子集生成简化后的ground程序，并提供了形式化定义和关键性质分析。使用特定编码使得现成的ASP求解器能够评估候选子集。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，应用diminution策略平均减少70%的grounding时间和85%的ground文件大小。

Conclusion: 利用diminution的概念显著缓解了ASP中的grounding瓶颈问题，证明了这是一种通用且稳健的方法。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于社会认知理论的统一框架，用于设计LLM社交代理，显著提高了代理在不同社交情境下的行为一致性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

*Dongwook Choi,Taeyoon Kwon,Dongil Yang,Hyojun Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种记忆增强的AR代理框架，通过四个模块支持个性化任务辅助，并提供了实现和评估策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR代理在支持多步骤复杂场景时存在局限性，无法有效利用用户长期经验和偏好。

Method: 框架包含四个互连模块：感知模块、记忆模块、时空推理模块和执行器模块，并提供了实现路线图和评估策略。

Result: 提出了一个记忆增强的AR代理框架，通过模块化设计和实现路线图展示了其跨领域应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个记忆增强的AR代理框架，旨在通过学习和适应用户特定经验来提供个性化任务辅助，从而推动更智能AR系统的发展。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于功能的知识编辑分类法，分析了不同知识类型的编辑效果，总结了现有方法的优缺点，并讨论了未来挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识可能过时或不准确，而重新训练成本高昂，知识编辑成为一种高效替代方案。现有调查多关注编辑机制，而忽略了被编辑知识的功能，因此需要更全面的视角。

Method: 本文引入了一种基于功能的分类法，通过两个轴（编辑机制和知识类型）来组织现有研究，并评估编辑效果。

Result: 本文通过功能分类法分析了不同知识类型（事实、时间、概念、常识和社交知识）的编辑效果，并评估了现有方法的适用性。

Conclusion: 本文总结了知识编辑领域的现状，指出了现有方法的优缺点，并提出了开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

TL;DR: GRainsaCK是一个标准化、模块化的软件工具，用于知识图谱链接预测解释方法的评估，解决了现有方法评估标准不统一的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱常不完整，链接预测方法缺乏可解释性，且现有解释方法缺乏统一的评估标准和基准资源。

Method: GRainsaCK将模型训练到解释评估的所有任务流程化，实现了主要组件的模块化和可扩展性，便于替换和扩展。

Result: 提出了GRainsaCK，一个支持知识图谱链接预测解释方法评估的软件资源，实现了评估流程的标准化和组件的模块化。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK是一个可复用的软件资源，它通过标准化评估协议和模块化设计，填补了知识图谱链接预测解释方法评估的空白，并提供了详细的文档和教程以促进其重用。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有mRAG方法在实时场景（如新闻分析和热门话题）中的刚性检索策略和视觉信息利用不足的问题。

Method: E-Agent采用一次性mRAG规划策略，通过动态协调多模态工具和任务感知执行序列来优化工作流程。

Result: E-Agent在RemPlan基准测试中表现出色，准确率提升13%，冗余搜索减少37%。

Conclusion: E-Agent在RemPlan和三个现有基准测试中表现出色，准确率比最先进的mRAG方法提高了13%，同时减少了37%的冗余搜索。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

Motivation: 探索AI（尤其是多模态大语言模型MLLMs）在情感识别方面的能力，及其与人类专家的对比，以推动情感智能AI系统的发展。

Method: 使用Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET)及其多种族版本(MRMET)评估MLLMs的情感识别能力，并与人类参与者进行对比。

Result: MLLMs在个体情感识别上平均表现优于人类，但在集体智慧模拟中人类显著优于MLLMs；人机协作（增强智能）的准确率最高。

Conclusion: MLLMs在个体情感识别上表现优异，但人类集体智慧及人机协作的协同效应为情感AI的发展提供了最有前景的路径。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

Motivation: 当前工具集成的数学推理系统采用单代理范式，可能导致认知负载干扰，影响推理和编码的协调性。

Method: 采用双代理混合框架：推理代理负责逐步问题分解，代码代理处理代码生成和执行。训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 双代理框架显著减少了认知干扰，提升了推理路径的正确率。

Conclusion: 双代理混合框架通过分离推理和编码任务，减少了认知干扰，提高了数学推理系统的稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k

training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态输入下面临日益增长的安全挑战，尤其是良性组合输入可能触发不安全的输出，这源于有缺陷或隐藏的推理过程。

Method: 论文提出了“隐式推理安全”概念，并开发了首个相关数据集Safe Semantics, Unsafe Interpretations（SSUI），通过简单上下文学习展示其缓解效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨前景理论是否适用于当代大型语言模型，以及表达人类不确定性的认知标记（如“可能”）是否会影响其决策行为。

Method: 设计了一个基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出了一个更通用和精确的评估框架，通过经验概率值引入不确定性，并将认知标记纳入框架以分析其对LLM决策行为的影响。

Result: 结果表明，前景理论在建模LLM决策行为时存在不一致性，尤其是在语言表达不确定性多样化的情境下。

Conclusion: 研究发现，利用前景理论（PT）建模大型语言模型（LLM）的决策行为并不总是可靠，尤其是在不确定性以多样化语言形式表达时。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory

Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）越来越多地融入社会系统，其放大有害偏见的风险成为关键安全问题。传统方法通常依赖数据过滤或后处理输出调节，将模型视为不透明的黑箱。

Method: 研究分为两个主要阶段：首先训练线性“探针”来检测模型内部激活中的偏见表示，其次利用这些发现计算“转向向量”以在推理过程中主动引导模型生成中立内容。

Result: 实验证明，探针能以近乎完美的准确性识别偏见内容，且偏见表示在模型的后期层最为显著。激活转向技术成功将偏见的生成内容引导至更中立的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种端到端的系统，通过机制解释性技术直接在模型内部识别和缓解偏见，为构建更安全、更可问责的大型语言模型提供了一种更直接和可解释的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

Conclusion: FiXGBoost模型在预请求乘客等待时间预测中表现出色，具有高解释性，为共享出行系统的效率提升和用户体验优化提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

Result: SMA 能够在半黑盒设置下实现细粒度的内容来源归因，并首次支持对 MRAG 系统中图像检索痕迹的成员推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

TL;DR: OpenCUA是一个开源框架，旨在通过标注工具、大规模数据集和可扩展模型推动计算机使用代理研究，其32B模型性能超越现有开源和部分商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型作为计算机使用代理的商业潜力增长，其关键细节仍不公开。为研究其能力、局限性和风险，需要开放的CUA框架。

Method: OpenCUA框架包括：（1）捕捉人类计算机使用演示的标注基础设施；（2）AgentNet，一个跨3个操作系统和200+应用的大规模任务数据集；（3）将演示转化为状态-动作对的可扩展流水线，并辅以长链思维推理。

Result: OpenCUA-32B在OSWorld-Verified上平均成功率达34.8%，创开源模型新纪录，并超越OpenAI CUA（GPT-4o）。分析表明该方法跨领域泛化能力强，且测试时计算量增加显著提升性能。

Conclusion: OpenCUA框架通过提供开源的工具、数据集和模型，为计算机使用代理（CUA）研究建立了开放的基础，并在性能上超越了现有开源模型和部分商业模型。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

TL;DR: BrowseMaster框架通过规划器-执行器分工，解决了LLM代理在搜索广度和推理深度上的局限，显著提升了复杂信息检索任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的代理在搜索广度和推理深度上存在局限，导致信息检索效率低下。

Method: 提出BrowseMaster框架，包含规划器和执行器：规划器根据任务约束制定和调整搜索策略，执行器进行高效、有针对性的检索，提供简洁相关证据。

Result: 在英文和中文基准测试中，BrowseMaster表现优于开源和专有基线，BrowseComp-en得分30.0，BrowseComp-zh得分46.5。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster框架通过程序增强的规划器-执行器代理对，有效平衡了搜索广度与推理深度，显著提升了复杂信息检索任务的性能。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Motivation: 现有基于大规模预训练的方法在多任务协调和复杂临床工作流处理上存在不足，AI代理在内窥镜领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了EndoAgent，一种基于双记忆设计的视觉到决策代理，整合了迭代推理与自适应工具选择和协作，并引入了EndoAgentBench基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，EndoAgent在视觉理解和语言生成能力上均优于通用及医学多模态模型。

Conclusion: EndoAgent通过双记忆设计和统一推理循环，显著提升了内窥镜图像诊断的灵活性和推理能力，优于现有通用和医学多模态模型。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: 分析了边缘设备上GPU资源利用率低的原因，发现底层资源和CPU事件是主要瓶颈，并提出了优化建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT设备普及和网络技术进步增加了对边缘实时数据处理的需求，而GPU在边缘计算中的资源共享机制尚不明确，导致其利用率低下。

Method: 通过整合多种分析工具（如NVIDIA Jetson边缘设备上的性能分析工具），对GPU利用率、内存使用、SM利用率和张量核心使用等高、低层指标进行详细分析。

Result: 在并发视觉推理负载下，GPU利用率可达100%，但底层资源利用率较低（15%-30%），且CPU端事件常成为性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管GPU利用率在特定优化下可达100%，但关键底层资源（如SM和张量核心）的利用率仅为15%至30%。此外，CPU端事件（如线程调度和上下文切换）常成为瓶颈，进一步限制GPU性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices and advancements in network technologies
have intensified the demand for real-time data processing at the network edge.
To address these demands, low-power AI accelerators, particularly GPUs, are
increasingly deployed for inference tasks, enabling efficient computation while
mitigating cloud-based systems' latency and bandwidth limitations. Despite
their growing deployment, GPUs remain underutilised even in computationally
intensive workloads. This underutilisation stems from the limited understanding
of GPU resource sharing, particularly in edge computing scenarios. In this
work, we conduct a detailed analysis of both high- and low-level metrics,
including GPU utilisation, memory usage, streaming multiprocessor (SM)
utilisation, and tensor core usage, to identify bottlenecks and guide
hardware-aware optimisations. By integrating traces from multiple profiling
tools, we provide a comprehensive view of resource behaviour on NVIDIA Jetson
edge devices under concurrent vision inference workloads. Our findings indicate
that while GPU utilisation can reach $100\%$ under specific optimisations,
critical low-level resources, such as SMs and tensor cores, often operate only
at $15\%$ to $30\%$ utilisation. Moreover, we observe that certain CPU-side
events, such as thread scheduling, context switching, etc., frequently emerge
as bottlenecks, further constraining overall GPU performance. We provide
several key observations for users of vision inference workloads on NVIDIA edge
devices.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面评估了联邦学习策略在5G边缘场景中的吞吐量预测性能，发现FedBN和LSTM/Transformer模型在非IID数据和实时应用中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G和6G网络中，准确且自适应的网络吞吐量预测对延迟敏感和带宽密集型应用至关重要。然而，现有方法大多依赖集中式训练和统一收集的数据，限制了其在异构移动环境中的适用性。

Method: 本文评估了三种聚合算法（FedAvg、FedProx和FedBN）在四种时间序列架构（LSTM、CNN、CNN+LSTM和Transformer）上的表现，使用了五种不同的真实世界数据集。

Result: FedBN在非IID条件下表现稳健。LSTM和Transformer模型在R2分数上比CNN基线高出80%。FedBN-based LSTM和Transformer模型在实时流媒体管道中提升了11.7%和11.4%的QoE分数。

Conclusion: 研究发现，FedBN在非IID条件下表现稳健，而LSTM和Transformer模型在R2分数上比基于CNN的基线高出80%。LSTM在准确性、训练轮次和时间足迹之间达到了有利的平衡。FedBN-based LSTM和Transformer模型在实时自适应流媒体管道中显著提升了QoE分数。

Abstract: Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for
latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G
networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with
uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile
environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first
comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput
prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation
algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series
architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse
real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client
heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction
performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,
convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently
delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM
and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2
scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,
they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher
context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance
between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end
applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into
a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and
Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,
over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable
insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput
prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的自适应调度方法，通过PPO算法优化多租户分布式系统的任务调度，实验证明其在多个指标上优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 多租户分布式系统中的任务调度面临动态资源变化、异构租户需求和公平性保证等关键挑战。

Method: 该研究将调度过程建模为马尔可夫决策过程，定义了状态空间、动作空间和奖励函数，并采用近端策略优化（PPO）算法设计了调度策略学习框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在任务延迟控制、资源效率、策略稳定性和公平性等多方面优于现有调度方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的基于强化学习的自适应调度方法在多目标奖励机制下，显著提升了分布式系统的调度效率和资源管理能力，具有较强的稳定性和泛化能力，为实际工程应用提供了价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses key challenges in task scheduling for multi-tenant
distributed systems, including dynamic resource variation, heterogeneous tenant
demands, and fairness assurance. An adaptive scheduling method based on
reinforcement learning is proposed. By modeling the scheduling process as a
Markov decision process, the study defines the state space, action space, and
reward function. A scheduling policy learning framework is designed using
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the core algorithm. This enables dynamic
perception of complex system states and real-time decision-making. Under a
multi-objective reward mechanism, the scheduler jointly optimizes task latency,
resource utilization, and tenant fairness. The coordination between the policy
network and the value network continuously refines the scheduling strategy.
This enhances overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, a series of experiments were conducted in multi-scenario
environments built using a real-world public dataset. The experiments evaluated
task latency control, resource efficiency, policy stability, and fairness. The
results show that the proposed method outperforms existing scheduling
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics. It demonstrates strong stability
and generalization ability. The proposed scheduling framework provides
practical and engineering value in policy design, dynamic resource modeling,
and multi-tenant service assurance. It effectively improves scheduling
efficiency and resource management in distributed systems under complex
conditions.

Conclusion: P/D-Device方案通过将大型语言模型在云端和设备端分离，显著降低了TTFT（首个令牌时间），平滑了TPOT（每个输出令牌时间），并提升了云端吞吐量。实验证明其优于其他方案。

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.
