### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPFF通过随机过滤补丁嵌入，聚焦关键食物特征，显著提升少样本食物图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物图像的视觉复杂性和变异性导致少样本学习模型在比较查询图像与支持图像时容易失去对关键元素的关注，从而造成误分类。

Method: 提出基于随机补丁过滤的少样本学习方法（SPFF），通过概率过滤与类别表示相似度较低的补丁嵌入，并利用相似度矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像的关系。

Result: 在Food-101、VireoFood-172和UECFood-256等少样本分类基准测试中，SPFF方法优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFF方法通过随机过滤补丁嵌入，有效聚焦于与类别表示相关性更高的补丁，显著提升了少样本学习模型在复杂食物图像分类任务中的性能。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

### [2] [Puppeteer: Rig and Animate Your 3D Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10898)
*Chaoyue Song,Xiu Li,Fan Yang,Zhongcong Xu,Jiacheng Wei,Fayao Liu,Jiashi Feng,Guosheng Lin,Jianfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer是一个自动绑定和动画生成框架，通过先进的骨骼预测和蒙皮权重推断技术，高效生成高质量3D动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代交互应用对动态3D内容需求增加，但静态3D模型到动画资产的转换仍是内容创建流程中的瓶颈。

Method: 系统通过自回归变换器预测骨骼结构，采用基于注意力的架构推断蒙皮权重，并结合可微分优化动画管道生成动画。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Puppeteer在骨骼预测准确性和蒙皮质量上显著优于现有技术，生成稳定且高保真的动画。

Conclusion: Puppeteer框架在自动绑定和动画生成方面显著优于现有技术，能够处理多样化的3D内容，生成高质量的动画。

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3 是一种自监督视觉基础模型，通过扩展数据和模型规模、引入 Gram anchoring 方法及事后策略，无需微调即可在多种任务中超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习无需手动数据标注，有望从多样化数据源中学习视觉表示，DINOv3 旨在实现这一愿景。

Method: 1. 通过仔细的数据准备、设计和优化扩展数据集和模型规模；2. 引入 Gram anchoring 方法解决密集特征图在长时间训练中退化的问题；3. 应用事后策略增强模型在分辨率、大小和文本对齐方面的灵活性。

Result: DINOv3 在各种视觉任务中显著超越之前的自监督和弱监督基础模型，并提供可扩展的解决方案以适应不同资源限制和部署场景。

Conclusion: DINOv3 是一个多功能视觉基础模型，无需微调即可在广泛的环境中超越专业的最先进模型，提供高质量密集特征并在各种视觉任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变形攻击检测已成为人脸识别系统中确保可靠验证场景的重要组成部分。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）进行零样本评估，分析了十种不同的文本提示，包括短文本和长文本提示。

Result: 在公开可用的面部生物特征数据集上进行了广泛实验，评估了五种不同变形生成技术和三种不同媒介下的SOTA预训练神经网络。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种多模态学习方法，能够为变形攻击检测提供文本描述，并通过零样本评估展示了其通用性和文本预测能力。

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [5] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合部首与象形语义的甲骨文解读方法，显著提升零样本性能，并提供考古学参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法忽视了字形与语义之间的复杂联系，导致泛化性和可解释性不足，特别是在零样本和未解读甲骨文场景下。

Method: 提出了一种基于大型视觉语言模型的可解释甲骨文解读方法，包括渐进式训练策略和部首-象形双重匹配机制。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，该方法实现了Top-10准确率的最优性能，并展示了卓越的零样本解读能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合部首分析和象形-语义理解，显著提升了甲骨文零样本解读性能，并为未解读甲骨文提供了考古学上有价值的参考结果。

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种深度学习方法，用于TBDXA扫描中自动放置基准点，验证了其高准确率，并展示了其在身体成分和健康生物标志物研究中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBDXA成像是一种低成本的全身体成像技术，广泛用于身体成分评估，但缺乏自动化的基准点放置方法。

Method: 开发并验证了一种基于深度学习的自动基准点放置方法，使用了1,683份手动标注的TBDXA扫描数据，并在外部测试数据集中达到了99.5%的关键点正确率。

Result: 方法在外部测试数据集中表现优异，关键点正确率达到99.5%。此外，该方法被用于在35,928次扫描中放置关键点，用于形状和外观建模（SAM），并验证了与健康生物标志物的关联。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅验证了深度学习在TBDXA扫描中自动放置基准点的有效性，还展示了其在身体成分和形状建模中的应用价值，为健康生物标志物的研究提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [7] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MANGO方法，通过可逆交叉注意力层和三种新机制，显式学习多模态融合，在多个任务中实现SoTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法依赖于Transformer的注意力机制，难以捕捉多模态输入的本质特征和复杂结构，因此需要一种显式、可解释和可追踪的多模态融合学习方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的多模态注意力归一化流（MANGO）方法，包括可逆交叉注意力（ICA）层和三种新的交叉注意力机制：MMCA、IMCA和LICA。

Result: 在语义分割、图像到图像翻译和电影类型分类三个多模态学习任务中，MANGO方法表现卓越。

Conclusion: MANGO方法在多模态学习任务中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [8] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，结合少量真实图像与大量合成图像可显著提升西瓜病害分类模型的性能，验证了混合使用两者的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式人工智能（GenAI）模型在农业计算机视觉训练中提供了新的可能性，但缺乏对结合真实与合成图像有效性的评估。

Method: 研究采用EfficientNetV2-L模型架构，结合增强的微调和迁移学习技术，对五种不同处理（H0至H4）进行训练。

Result: 模型在H2、H3和H4处理中表现出高精度、召回率和F1分数，加权F1分数从0.65（H0）提升至1.00（H3-H4）。

Conclusion: 研究验证了仅依赖合成图像不足以替代真实图像，而是需要以混合方式使用两者，以最大化作物病害分类模型的性能。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [9] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过合成数据生成和轻量级适配，显著提升视觉语言模型在工业泄漏检测等安全关键领域的性能，解决了真实数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）在通用视觉识别中表现出强大的零样本能力，但在工业泄漏检测等安全关键领域，由于事件罕见、敏感且难以标注，其性能显著下降。

Method: 引入了一个以高质量合成数据生成管道为核心的可扩展框架，并展示了该合成语料库如何有效支持参数高效微调（PEFT）和大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）的性能提升。

Result: 使用合成数据（SynSpill数据集）时，VLMs和检测器的性能均有显著提升，且两者性能相当。在没有合成数据的情况下，VLMs在未见过的泄漏场景中仍比检测器表现更好。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据是弥合安全关键应用领域差距的有力手段，结合合成生成和轻量级适配为在工业环境中部署视觉系统提供了一条成本效益高、可扩展的途径。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [10] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DGS 高斯属性的压缩方法 EntropyGS 通过因子化和参数化熵编码，显著降低码率，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS 的高斯创建和视图渲染通常在不同时间或设备上进行，因此高斯属性的存储、传输和压缩成为必要。

Method: 通过相关性和统计分析 3DGS 高斯属性，发现球谐 AC 属性遵循拉普拉斯分布，而旋转、缩放和不透明度可用高斯混合模型近似。基于此，提出 EntropyGS 方法，自适应量化属性并估计分布参数以辅助熵编码。

Result: EntropyGS 在基准数据集上实现了约 30 倍的码率降低，同时保持与输入 3DGS 数据相似的渲染质量，编码和解码速度快。

Conclusion: EntropyGS 提出了一种因子化和参数化的熵编码方法，显著减少了 3DGS 高斯属性的存储和传输需求，同时保持了渲染质量，编码和解码速度快。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRFD是一种无需训练的解码方法，通过区域间一致性建模减少LVLMs的幻觉，提升事实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LVLMs因视觉输入信息验证能力有限而产生的幻觉问题，即生成的文本与视觉输入不一致。

Method: 提出Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD)，一种无需训练的解码方法，通过交叉注意力识别显著区域，生成初始响应，并基于Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)计算可靠性权重，最后使用区域感知提示进行一致性融合。

Result: 实验表明，MRFD在多个LVLMs和基准测试中显著减少了幻觉，提高了回答的事实性。

Conclusion: MRFD通过建模区域间一致性显著减少了LVLMs的幻觉现象，提升了回答的事实性，且无需模型更新。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于外观的PoG估计器因个体差异难以泛化，且校准后的估计器对头部姿态变化敏感，需研究稳健的校准策略。

Method: 构建了MobilePoG基准，包含32名个体在固定或连续变化头部姿态下的面部图像，并系统分析了校准点和头部姿态多样性对估计准确性的影响。

Result: 实验表明，校准时引入更广泛的头部姿态范围可提升估计器处理姿态变化的能力。动态校准策略比传统策略更有效。

Conclusion: 通过动态校准策略，提出了一种对头部姿态变化不敏感的PoG估计器，该策略在用户友好且高效的校准过程中自然引入头部姿态变化。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态光学图像匹配因不同光谱响应导致的非线性辐射和几何形变差异而精度下降，PCWLAD方法旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PCWLAD方法分为粗匹配和细匹配两步：粗匹配使用结构相似性指数（SSIM），细匹配则结合辐射和几何变换模型，采用互结构滤波和WLAD准则估计亚像素偏移。

Result: PCWLAD在正确匹配率（CMR）和均方根误差（RMSE）上优于其他八种方法，平均匹配精度约为0.4像素。

Conclusion: PCWLAD方法在三种数据集上均优于现有的八种最先进方法，平均匹配精度达到约0.4像素，证明了其在多模态光学图像匹配中的高效性。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

TL;DR: InterSyn是一种新颖的运动合成框架，通过交织学习策略结合单人和多人在线交互动态，生成更自然、协调的运动序列，并在性能上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将单人动态和多人在线交互动态分开处理，忽略了真实场景中的自然交互和微妙协调。InterSyn旨在通过交织学习策略解决这一问题。

Method: InterSyn包含两个关键模块：交织交互合成（INS）模块和相对协调细化（REC）模块。INS模块从第一人称视角统一建模单人和交互行为，而REC模块优化相互动态，确保角色间的同步运动。

Result: 实验结果表明，InterSyn生成的运动序列在文本到运动对齐和多样性方面优于现有方法，为自然和鲁棒的运动合成设定了新基准。

Conclusion: InterSyn通过交织学习策略，结合了单人动态和多人在线交互的动态，生成了更自然、更协调的运动序列，并在文本到运动对齐和多样性方面超越了现有方法。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

Conclusion: 本文总结了当前OoD分割方法的四大类别，并讨论了自动驾驶场景中的新兴挑战及未来研究方向。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are

Method: 首先从大规模图像数据集中提取丰富的内在场景属性，并通过自编码器将这些属性聚合为单一潜在变量。基于预训练的大规模潜在扩散模型（LDMs），该方法通过在图像和内在属性域之间共享互信息，同时去噪这两个域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够纠正空间不一致性，生成更自然的场景布局，同时保持基础模型的保真度和文本对齐能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过同时生成图像和其对应的内在属性，有效提升了图像的空间一致性和真实性，同时保持了基础模型（如Stable Diffusion）的保真度和文本对齐能力。

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

TL;DR: NSegment+通过解耦图像和标签变换，有效处理隐式标签噪声，显著提升语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集中的隐式标签噪声（如模糊物体边界和标注者差异）会损害模型性能，而传统数据增强方法可能放大这些噪声。

Method: 引入了NSegment+框架，通过仅对分割标签施加弹性变形而保持原始图像不变，以学习更鲁棒的物体结构表示。

Result: 在Vaihingen、LoveDA、Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC数据集上，mIoU分别提升了+2.29、+2.38、+1.75和+3.39。

Conclusion: NSegment+通过解耦图像和标签的变换，有效处理了语义分割中的隐式标签噪声，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶员分心检测模型在真实场景中泛化能力不足，主要由于数据标注成本高导致的少样本学习挑战，以及训练数据与目标部署条件之间的域偏移问题。

Method: 提出了一种姿态驱动的质量控制数据增强框架（PQ-DAF），利用渐进条件扩散模型（PCDMs）生成多样化的训练样本，并通过CogVLM视觉语言模型进行样本质量过滤。

Result: 实验表明，PQ-DAF在少样本条件下显著提升了模型泛化性能。

Conclusion: PQ-DAF通过结合姿态驱动的数据增强和基于视觉语言模型的样本过滤，显著提升了少样本驾驶员分心检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像扩散模型中，特定词汇强关联内容难以抑制的问题，如生成‘Charlie Chaplin’时无法避免‘mustache’的出现。

Method: 提出了一种选择性抑制delta向量（SSDV）方法，通过修改文本嵌入空间中的向量来削弱不想要内容的影响，并优化delta向量以适应个性化T2I模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性指标上均显著优于现有方法，尤其在个性化T2I模型中实现了更精确的抑制。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的方法来抑制文本到图像扩散模型中与特定词汇强关联的内容，通过引入delta向量在文本嵌入空间直接操作，显著提升了生成图像的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖固定斜率锚点，对多样化道路几何的鲁棒性不足，SC-Lane旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature模块动态预测权重，以及Height Consistency模块确保时间一致性。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中，SC-Lane以64.3%的F-score显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-Lane通过自适应融合多斜率特征和保持时间一致性，显著提升了3D车道检测和高度估计的性能，达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

Result: NanoControl 在参数和计算开销上仅增加 0.024% 和 0.029%，同时实现了最先进的可控文本到图像生成性能。

Conclusion: NanoControl 通过引入 LoRA 风格的控制模块和 KV-Context 增强机制，显著降低了计算开销，同时保持了卓越的生成质量和可控性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在自动驾驶中因训练数据局限于静态图像文本对，难以精确理解动态交通场景的时空推理需求。

Method: 研究团队构建了STRIDE-QA，一个基于东京100小时多传感器驾驶数据的大规模视觉问答（VQA）数据集，包含1600万问答对和285K帧图像，支持通过3D边界框、分割掩码和多对象跟踪进行密集自动标注。

Result: 微调后的VLMs在STRIDE-QA上表现显著提升，空间定位成功率55%，未来运动预测一致性28%，而通用VLMs接近零分。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA为开发更可靠的视觉语言模型（VLMs）奠定了基础，特别是在安全关键型自动驾驶系统中，通过提供大规模的时空推理数据集，显著提升了模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Conclusion: CRISP在YouTube-VIS-2019和YouTube-VIS-2021数据集上显著优于现有方法，有效避免了灾难性遗忘，并提升了分割和分类性能。

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Conclusion: DOD-SA框架通过单模态标注实现了红外-可见光目标检测的高效训练，显著降低了标注成本，并在DroneVehicle数据集上超越了现有最优方法。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Conclusion: 研究表明，视觉系统可能被优化以去除特定水平的失真和稀疏性，且生物启发模型无需人类监督即可学习感知度量。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

Conclusion: TS-Mamba方法在大多数情况下实现了最先进的性能，并在计算复杂度上减少了超过22.7%，展示了其在在线视频超分辨率任务中的高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Result: 在分布外数据上，模型性能接近使用更多标记图像训练的模型，且基于AE的质量评估比一致性排名更准确。

Conclusion: 结合领域随机化和基于自编码器的质量控制，可以有效实现半监督分割，即使在标记数据极少的情况下也能达到接近全监督模型的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

TL;DR: STAMP是一种基于深度学习的多实例学习框架，用于自动诊断肺腺癌中的STAS，通过多中心数据验证表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STAS在肺腺癌中是一种新的侵袭模式，与肿瘤复发和生存率降低相关，但目前大规模诊断仍依赖人工，存在漏诊和误诊风险，亟需利用深度学习模型提升诊断效率。

Method: 提出了一种多模式注意力感知的多实例学习框架STAMP，采用双分支架构从不同语义空间学习STAS相关的病理特征，结合Transformer编码和多模式注意力聚合模块动态选择与STAS病理密切相关的区域。

Result: STAMP在三个数据集上的AUC分别为0.8058、0.8017和0.7928，表现优于临床水平。

Conclusion: STAMP模型在STAS-SXY、STAS-TXY和STAS-TCGA数据集上取得了具有竞争力的诊断结果，AUC分别为0.8058、0.8017和0.7928，超越了临床水平。

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合MSAA和双重几何约束的优化框架，显著提升3D高斯飞溅在细节保留和实时渲染方面的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 3D高斯飞溅技术虽在实时新视角合成方面取得进展，但场景优化中几何约束不足常导致高频纹理和锐利不连续性区域的模糊重建。

Method: 提出一个综合优化框架，结合多重采样抗锯齿（MSAA）和双重几何约束：（a）通过动态梯度分析优先处理欠重建区域的自适应加权策略；（b）在物体边界实施几何正则化的梯度差分约束。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在细节保留（尤其是高频纹理和锐利不连续性）方面达到最先进性能，同时保持实时渲染效率。定量指标和感知研究证实了在结构相似性（SSIM）和感知质量（LPIPS）上的显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过整合多重采样抗锯齿（MSAA）和双重几何约束，提出的优化框架在保留高频纹理和锐利不连续性的同时，实现了实时渲染效率的显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

TL;DR: TweezeEdit 是一种无需调优和反转的图像编辑框架，通过正则化去噪路径和梯度驱动的高效语义注入，显著提升语义保留和目标对齐，同时实现快速编辑（12步/1.6秒）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本引导的图像编辑方法往往过度对齐目标提示，而未能充分保留源图像语义，且因依赖反转锚点而导致编辑路径过长。

Method: TweezeEdit 是一个无需调优和反转的框架，通过正则化整个去噪路径而非仅依赖反转锚点，确保源语义保留并缩短编辑路径。通过梯度驱动的正则化，利用一致性模型沿直接路径高效注入目标提示语义。

Result: TweezeEdit 在广泛的实验中显示出其在语义保留和目标对齐方面的卓越性能，且编辑效率极高。

Conclusion: TweezeEdit 在语义保留和目标对齐方面表现出色，显著优于现有方法，且仅需12步（每次编辑1.6秒），展现了实时应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP通过隐式学习多粒度语义理解，显著提升了医学图像定位性能，并在下游任务中实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因依赖有限的辅助异常样本或ID数据生成异常信息，导致语义监督不足，性能不佳。RAP旨在通过检索外部知识提供更丰富的语义监督。

Method: 提出了一种名为RAP的新型OOD检测方法，利用外部知识检索增强模型的提示，动态更新OOD提示以适应测试环境。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集的1-shot OOD检测中，RAP将平均FPR95降低了7.05%，AUROC提高了1.71%。

Conclusion: RAP方法通过检索外部知识增强预训练视觉语言模型的提示，显著提升了OOD检测性能，实验证明其在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

TL;DR: PTQAT是一种混合量化方法，通过选择性微调和PTQ结合，在保持高效的同时提升量化模型性能，适用于多种任务和架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTQ和QAT作为主流模型量化方法各有缺点：PTQ可能导致不可接受的性能下降，而QAT则因权重微调带来高GPU内存需求和长训练时间。PTQAT旨在解决这种速度与精度的权衡问题。

Method: PTQAT结合了PTQ和QAT的优势，通过选择输出差异较小的层进行微调，而非差异较大的层，以更好地补偿量化误差的传播。该方法支持多种量化位宽（如4位）和不同模型架构（如CNN和Transformer）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，PTQAT在多种3D感知任务（如目标检测、语义分割和占用预测）中均优于QAT-only基线，取得了显著的性能提升（如NDS和mAP增益）。

Conclusion: PTQAT作为一种新颖的通用混合量化算法，通过选择关键层进行QAT微调并在其余层执行PTQ，有效平衡了速度与精度。实验证明，该方法在多种3D感知任务中均优于仅使用QAT的基线模型，且效率更高。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合自我中心视频和音乐来预测人类舞蹈动作的新方法，通过引入EgoAIST++数据集和基于扩散模型与Mamba的EgoMusic Motion Network，显著提升了动作预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Method: FGA集成了三个关键组件：(1)基于傅里叶特征的多层感知机（MLP）用于位置频率编码，(2)跨分辨率相关注意力层用于自适应空间对齐，(3)频域L1损失用于频谱保真监督。

Result: FGA在五种不同的超分辨率骨干网络上均表现优异，平均PSNR提升0.12~0.14 dB，频域一致性提升高达29%，尤其在纹理丰富的数据集上效果显著。

Conclusion: FGA作为一种轻量级上采样模块，通过集成傅里叶特征、跨分辨率相关注意力层和频域L1损失，有效减少了混叠伪影并保留了高频细节，成为传统上采样方法的实用替代方案。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Motivation: 解决LVLMs在细粒度街级定位中的性能不足问题，通过整合城市范围内的地址定位能力，提升基于街景图像的问答灵活性。

Method: 提出两阶段训练协议：跨视图对齐调优和地址定位调优，结合卫星图像作为宏观线索，并引入自动标签生成机制。

Result: AddressVLM在Pittsburgh和San Francisco数据集上的平均地址定位准确率分别超过其他LVLMs 9%和12%。

Conclusion: AddressVLM通过结合卫星图像和街景图像，显著提升了LVLMs在细粒度地址定位任务中的性能，证明了跨视图对齐调优的有效性。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光学遥感图像中目标尺度变化大、背景对比度低的问题，以及现有方法在整合全局与局部特征上的不足。

Method: 提出GCRPNet网络，结合VSS编码器、DS-HGAM模块和LEVSS解码器，通过差异相似性引导的图注意力和自适应扫描策略增强特征表示。

Result: 实验结果表明GCRPNet在显著目标检测任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GCRPNet基于Mamba架构，通过DS-HGAM和LEVSS模块有效整合全局与局部特征，显著提升了光学遥感图像中显著目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种混合真实与合成数据的方法，构建高质量无重叠身份的人脸数据集，并在竞赛中获得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个不与现有公开人脸数据集身份重叠的高质量人脸数据集，以提升人脸识别模型的性能。

Method: 通过混合专家（MoE）策略清理HSFace数据集，结合Stable Diffusion生成合成身份，并使用Vec2Face快速扩展图像，最后采用课程学习策略优化训练。

Result: 最终数据集每个身份包含50张图像，新生成的身份经过主流人脸数据集检查确保无泄漏，显著提升了模型在10K、20K和100K身份规模上的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法在DataCV ICCV Challenge中获得了第一名，实验结果表明构建的数据集在不同规模的身份识别任务中均提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

Motivation: 利用多个部分标注的数据集训练多视网膜疾病筛查模型可减少对全标注数据集的依赖，但面临跨医疗站点数据集的显著域偏移和部分类别标签缺失的挑战。

Method: PSScreen由两个流组成，一个学习确定性特征，另一个通过不确定性注入学习概率特征。利用文本指导将两类特征解耦为疾病特征，并通过特征蒸馏对齐以提升域泛化能力。同时，采用伪标签一致性解决标签缺失问题，并引入自蒸馏从确定性流向概率流传递任务相关语义以增强检测性能。

Result: 实验表明，PSScreen在六种视网膜疾病和正常状态的检测上平均性能显著提升，并在域内和域外数据集上达到最优结果。

Conclusion: PSScreen显著提升了六种视网膜疾病和正常状态的检测性能，并在域内和域外数据集上实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在自我中心视频问答（EgocentricQA）的研究主要局限于日常活动，而实际部署中会遇到视觉风格和语义内容差异显著的领域偏移问题。

Method: 提出了EgoCross基准测试，覆盖手术、工业、极限运动和动物视角四个领域，包含约1,000个QA对和798个视频片段，支持OpenQA和CloseQA格式的细粒度评估。

Result: 实验表明，大多数现有MLLMs（无论是通用型还是自我中心专用型）在非日常领域的泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: EgoCross基准测试揭示了现有MLLMs在跨域泛化上的局限性，特别是在非日常活动领域。研究提出了潜在的改进方向，如微调和强化学习，并希望EgoCross能推动领域自适应、鲁棒的自我中心视频理解的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

Method: 研究人员引入了AEGIS，这是一个针对超真实和语义细微的AI生成视频检测的大规模基准，包含10,000多个经过严格筛选的真实和合成视频，并提供了多模态注释。

Result: 实验表明，先进的视觉语言模型在AEGIS最具挑战性的子集上检测能力有限，突显了该数据集超越现有模型泛化能力的独特复杂性和真实性。

Conclusion: AEGIS为视频真实性检测领域提供了一个不可或缺的大规模评估基准，推动了开发真正鲁棒、可靠且广泛通用的视频真实性检测方法的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

Motivation: 现有的扩散变换器在高质量视频生成中存在迭代去噪过程慢和长序列二次注意力成本高的问题，亟需一种高效的加速方法。

Method: BLADE框架结合了自适应块稀疏注意力（ASA）机制和稀疏感知的步数蒸馏范式，动态生成内容感知的稀疏掩码，并将稀疏性直接融入蒸馏过程。

Result: BLADE在CogVideoX-5B和Wan2.1-1.3B模型上分别实现了8.89倍和14.10倍的加速，同时VBench-2.0基准测试分数显著提升。

Conclusion: BLADE框架通过创新的自适应块稀疏注意力机制和稀疏感知的步数蒸馏范式，显著提升了视频生成的效率和质量，实现了高达14.10倍的加速效果，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于ControlNet的扩散RefSR方法在信息对齐上表现不佳，且现有数据集分辨率有限、图像质量差，无法支持高质量恢复。

Method: 设计了参考匹配策略（Reference Matching Strategy）来有效匹配LR图像与参考HR图像，并引入了Landmark-4K数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，TriFlowSR能更有效地利用参考HR图像的语义和纹理信息。

Conclusion: TriFlowSR是一种新型框架，能够明确实现LR图像与参考HR图像之间的模式匹配，并在UHD地标场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Motivation: 当前音频驱动的说话头部视频生成方法存在运动模糊和唇部抖动问题，主要由于缺乏显式发音先验知识。HM-Talker旨在通过结合解剖学指导的显式线索来解决这一问题。

Result: 实验证明HM-Talker在视觉质量和唇部同步准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HM-Talker通过结合隐式和显式运动线索，显著提升了说话头部视频的生成质量，特别是在唇部同步和视觉质量方面。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

Conclusion: Multi-Modal Agent通过动态工作流和专门工具的结合，显著提升了在RVOS和Ref-AVS任务上的性能，展示了其灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

*Zheng Qin,Ruobing Zheng,Yabing Wang,Tianqi Li,Yi Yuan,Jingdong Chen,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumanSense基准评估MLLMs的人类中心能力，发现多模态增强和推理能力是关键改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在复杂人类意图理解和提供共情、上下文感知响应方面缺乏细粒度评估框架。

Method: 采用多阶段、模态递进的强化学习增强Omni模型的推理能力，并通过设计提示提升非推理模型的性能。

Result: 研究表明领先的MLLMs仍有改进空间，补充音频和文本信息可显著提升性能，Omni-modal模型在任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 论文提出HumanSense基准，评估MLLMs在人类中心场景下的表现，并展示了通过多模态增强和推理能力提升模型性能的方法。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

*Yixing Liu,Minggui Teng,Yifei Xia,Peiqi Duan,Boxin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvTurb利用事件流解耦湍流模糊和倾斜效应，通过两步网络提升图像质量，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致的模糊和倾斜失真严重影响了图像质量，现有的单帧或多帧方法难以解决这一高度不适定问题。

Method: EvTurb采用两步事件引导网络：首先利用事件积分减少模糊，然后通过事件流生成的方差图消除倾斜失真。

Result: 实验表明，EvTurb在性能上超越了现有最优方法，并保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: EvTurb通过事件流成功解耦了湍流引起的模糊和倾斜效应，显著提升了图像质量，并在计算效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: ToonComposer 是一个统一中间帧生成和上色的生成模型，通过稀疏草图注入和卡通适配方法提升了AI辅助卡通制作的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卡通和动漫制作涉及关键帧、中间帧生成和上色，需大量人工。现有AI方法通常单独处理这些步骤，导致错误累积和伪影。ToonComposer 旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ToonComposer 通过稀疏草图注入机制和卡通适配方法（空间低秩适配器）统一了中间帧生成和上色步骤，利用现代视频基础模型并保持其时间先验。

Result: ToonComposer 在视觉质量、运动一致性和生产效率上优于现有方法，支持稀疏输入并允许多草图精确控制。

Conclusion: ToonComposer 提供了一种更优且更灵活的解决方案，显著提升了AI辅助卡通制作的视觉质量、运动一致性和生产效率。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P$^3$A是一种针对自动驾驶2D目标检测的对抗补丁攻击框架，通过新指标PASR、损失函数LCSL和数据预处理PSPP，显著提升攻击效果和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于迁移性的黑盒攻击在自动驾驶场景中因评估指标（mAP）和低分辨率数据训练的局限性，导致攻击效果被高估且实际成功率低。

Method: 提出了P$^3$A框架，包括三个关键创新：1) 引入PASR指标以更准确评估攻击效果；2) 设计LCSL损失函数提升攻击可迁移性；3) 使用PSPP作为数据预处理步骤以保持高分辨率数据集的攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，P$^3$A在未见模型和高分辨率数据集上均优于现有攻击方法，无论是基于PASR还是传统mAP指标。

Conclusion: P$^3$A框架通过提出PASR指标、LCSL损失函数和PSPP数据预处理步骤，显著提升了对抗补丁在自动驾驶2D目标检测中的攻击效果和可迁移性，特别是在高分辨率数据集上。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

TL;DR: FIND-Net通过频域和空间域结合的创新方法，有效减少CT中的金属伪影，同时保持解剖结构，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属植入物在CT成像中引起的高密度伪影严重降低了图像质量，影响了诊断和治疗计划的制定。现有深度学习算法在MAR方面虽取得了一定成功，但在抑制伪影和保留结构细节方面仍有不足。

Method: FIND-Net采用了一种新颖的MAR框架，结合了快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）层和可训练的高斯滤波，将MAR视为在空间和频域中操作的混合任务。

Result: 实验表明，FIND-Net在合成数据集上优于现有MAR方法，MAE降低了3.07%，SSIM提高了0.18%，PSNR提升了0.90%。在真实临床CT扫描中也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FIND-Net通过结合频域和空间域处理，显著提升了金属伪影减少（MAR）的性能，同时保持了解剖结构的完整性，展示了在临床CT扫描中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

TL;DR: Chamfer Guidance是一种无需训练的指导方法，通过少量真实样本提升生成图像的多样性和质量，适用于下游任务训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前条件图像生成模型在生成质量上的进步牺牲了生成多样性，限制了其作为合成训练数据的实用性。

Method: 提出了一种训练自由的指导方法Chamfer Guidance，利用少量真实样本图像来表征合成数据的质量和多样性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和标准地理多样性基准测试中，Chamfer Guidance在保持或提高生成质量的同时，显著提升了生成多样性。使用32张真实图像时，精度达到97.5%，分布覆盖率达到92.7%。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance通过利用少量真实样本图像，显著提升了生成图像的多样性和质量，同时减少了计算开销，适用于下游任务如分类器的训练。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

TL;DR: ChatENV 是首个结合卫星图像对和真实传感器数据的交互式视觉语言模型，通过多源标注和 LoRA 微调实现高性能环境监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）忽视环境传感器的因果信号，依赖单一来源的标注（易受风格偏见影响），且缺乏交互式场景推理能力。

Method: 创建了一个包含 177k 图像的数据集（152k 时间对），覆盖 62 种土地利用类别和 197 个国家，并附有传感器元数据；使用 GPT-4o 和 Gemini 2.0 标注数据以提高多样性；通过 LoRA 适配器微调 Qwen-2.5-VL 模型以实现交互式聊天功能。

Result: ChatENV 在时间和假设推理任务中表现优异（如 BERT-F1 0.903），并支持交互式分析。

Conclusion: ChatENV 是一个强大的工具，支持基于传感器的环境监测和交互式场景分析，性能优于或媲美现有最先进的时间模型。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注训练中未见的严重图像变换对视觉编码器鲁棒性的影响，而本文则探讨了更细微或不可见的图像采集和处理参数的影响。

Method: 通过分析图像采集过程中的参数和变换，研究这些细微或不可见的参数如何被学习并影响视觉表示。

Result: 研究发现这些参数被系统地编码在学习的视觉表示中，并能轻易被恢复，且它们的存在对语义预测有深远影响，取决于与语义标签的相关性或反相关性。

Conclusion: 该论文揭示了图像采集和处理参数对视觉编码器语义预测的深远影响，无论这些参数是否对人类可见，都可能对模型性能产生显著的正向或负向影响。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Motivation: 研究旨在通过无标记的姿态估计和自动学习时间运动特征来消除手动特征工程的必要性，同时能够在短序列和小训练数据集上工作。

Method: 利用T-LEAP姿态估计模型从行走的牛的视频中提取九个关键点的运动序列，并将关键点轨迹作为BLSTM分类器的输入进行二元跛行分类。

Result: 最佳架构的分类准确率达到85%，优于基于特征的80%准确率，并且BLSTM分类器仅需一秒的视频数据即可检测跛行。

Conclusion: 结合姿态估计和双向长短期记忆（BLSTM）神经网络的方法在牛跛行检测中表现出色，显著优于依赖手动设计特征的现有方法。

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

Motivation: 解决现有提示调优方法因依赖稀疏类别标签或分散的LLM生成描述而导致知识表示碎片化和迁移性差的问题。

Method: SemPT采用两步提示策略，利用LLM提取共享视觉属性和生成属性级描述，并通过视觉引导加权减少噪声，同时联合对齐图像嵌入与标签和属性增强的文本嵌入。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上，SemPT在基础到新类别泛化、跨数据集迁移、跨领域迁移和少样本学习等多种设置中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SemPT通过共享属性级知识和动态选择嵌入策略，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，有效解决了视觉迁移学习中的泛化挑战。

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

TL;DR: HyperTea利用超图建模高阶时空关联，结合CNN、RNN和HGNN，显著提升移动红外小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在MIRSTD中仅建模低阶特征关联且局限于单一时间尺度，而超图在高阶关联学习中的潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 提出HyperTea，包含GTEM、LTEM和TAM三个模块，分别用于全局和局部时间上下文增强以及跨尺度特征对齐。

Result: 在DAUB和IRDST数据集上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HyperTea通过整合CNN、RNN和HGNN，显著提升了MIRSTD的检测性能，并在DAUB和IRDST数据集上实现了SOTA表现。

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合隐式神经表示和物理信息正则化的方法，用于胎儿脑部MRI的T2映射，显著减少了扫描时间并提高了对运动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑部MRI的T2映射在0.55T中场强下具有改进脑部发育表征的潜力，但现有方法因依赖多次运动伪影堆叠采集而面临长扫描时间和高运动敏感性的挑战。

Method: 该方法结合了隐式神经表示和物理信息正则化，通过跨TE的联合重建来应对严重运动伪影，同时保持解剖和定量T2保真度。

Result: 研究在模拟胎儿脑部和具有胎儿类似运动的成人活体数据集上展示了最先进的性能，并首次在0.55T场强下实现了活体胎儿T2映射。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在0.55T场强下首次实现胎儿脑部T2映射的潜力，并表明通过利用解剖冗余性可以减少每个回波时间（TE）所需的堆叠数量。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Conclusion: IADGPT在工业异常检测中表现出色，尤其在处理新产品的泛化能力上，同时在异常定位和推理任务中也展现了竞争力。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

*Sehajdeep SIngh,A V Subramanyam*

TL;DR: 提出轻量级视角转换框架TUNet，结合DDIM反演和融合策略，高效合成高质量新视角图像，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单张图像合成新视角需解决3D结构推断、遮挡区域细节恢复及几何一致性维护等挑战，现有方法需微调大型扩散模型或从头训练，成本高且效果模糊、泛化性差。

Method: 提出了一种显式轻量级视角转换框架TUNet，结合相机姿态条件化的U-Net和DDIM反演技术，通过融合策略保留纹理和细节，并利用预训练扩散模型的生成先验进行新视角合成。

Result: 通过融合策略和TUNet的应用，显著提升了新视角合成的清晰度和细节保留能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在MVImgNet数据集上的实验表明，其性能优于现有方法，能够有效合成高质量的新视角图像。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCFNet通过融合事件相机和RGB相机，提出了一种运动线索融合网络，显著提升了复杂光照和快速移动场景下的物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机的动态范围限制导致在复杂交通环境（如夜间驾驶、隧道）中全局对比度降低和高频细节丢失，影响物体检测性能。

Method: MCFNet包括事件校正模块（ECM）用于时间对齐，事件动态上采样模块（EDUM）用于空间对齐，以及跨模态Mamba融合模块（CMM）用于自适应特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上的实验表明，MCFNet在低光照和快速移动场景中显著优于现有方法，特别是在DSEC-Det数据集上mAP50和mAP分别提升了7.4%和1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet通过整合事件相机和RGB相机，提出了一种运动线索融合网络，显著提升了在复杂光照和快速移动交通场景下的物体检测性能。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

TL;DR: CountCluster是一种无需外部工具或训练的方法，通过优化注意力图聚类，显著提升文本到图像生成中对象数量的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于扩散的文本到图像生成模型在图像质量和多样性上表现优异，但在准确反映输入提示中对象数量方面仍有不足。现有方法依赖于外部计数模块或学习到的特征表示，但效果有限且忽略了去噪早期阶段对对象数量的决定性影响。

Method: CountCluster在推理时基于注意力分数将对象交叉注意力图划分为k个聚类，定义每个聚类在空间上明确分离的理想分布，并优化潜在变量以对齐目标分布。

Result: 相比现有方法，CountCluster在对象数量准确性上平均提高了18.5%，并在多种提示下展现出优越的数量控制性能。

Conclusion: CountCluster方法通过引导对象交叉注意力图根据输入对象数量进行聚类，显著提高了对象数量控制的准确性，无需依赖外部工具或额外训练。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

Conclusion: 本文提出并评估了专为Sentinel-1采集的非聚焦SAR数据实时推理设计的神经网络，证明了在FPGA上进行机载处理的可行性，并展示了目标分类（如船只与风车）的潜力。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的跨视角定位框架，通过改进跨视角图像匹配，显著提升了定位精度和图像匹配质量，并引入了首个带有像素级对应标注的基准数据集CVFM。

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Motivation: 现有方法（如k-means聚类）在代码本特征空间中表现不佳，存在token空间差异和质心距离不准确等问题，需提出更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE)，采用基于实例的距离和凝聚合并技术，替代传统的基于质心的距离方法，以更合理地处理token特征空间中的差异。

Result: DCPE在LlamaGen-B上加速训练42%，并提升了最终FID和IS性能。

Conclusion: DCPE作为一种替代k-means聚类的方法，通过更有效地挖掘和利用代码本中的token相似性信息，显著提升了自回归模型的训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过监督微调和强化学习优化VLMs的时空物理推理能力，发现其在泛化性上仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空物理推理是理解真实物理世界的基础能力，但当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在这一关键任务上表现不足，主要受限于人为偏见和缺乏深度推理。

Method: 应用监督微调（supervised fine-tuning）和基于规则的强化学习（rule-based reinforcement learning）来优化Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 优化后的Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型在时空物理推理能力上显著提升，超越了主流专有模型。

Conclusion: 尽管通过监督微调和基于规则的强化学习显著提升了Qwen2.5-VL-7B在时空物理推理上的能力，但其在新物理场景中的泛化能力仍有限，凸显了该领域对新方法的迫切需求。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于用户交互和光流分析的创新人脸活体检测方法，通过控制脸部移动模式和光流分析，显著提高了检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前被动的人脸活体检测方法在区分真实人脸与呈现攻击（如打印照片、屏幕显示、面具和视频回放）时存在局限性，需要一种更可靠的方法来提高检测准确性。

Method: 通过设计一种用户交互场景，参与者被指示将正面朝向的脸部缓慢靠近摄像头，结合光流分析，利用神经光流估计提取面部体积信息，并通过神经分类器处理光流和RGB帧，利用时空特征进行活体检测。

Result: 该方法通过控制用户的脸部移动模式，结合光流分析，显著提高了活体检测的准确性，能够有效区分真实人脸与多种呈现攻击。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于用户交互和光流分析的创新方法，显著提高了人脸活体检测的准确性和鲁棒性，能够有效区分真实人脸与多种呈现攻击。

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VasoMIM是一种针对X射线血管造影的自监督学习框架，通过解剖引导的掩蔽和一致性损失提升血管分割性能，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于血管与背景像素的严重类别不平衡，传统MIM方法难以捕捉血管解剖结构，导致血管表示较弱。

Method: VasoMIM框架包括解剖引导的掩蔽策略和解剖一致性损失，前者优先掩蔽血管区域，后者增强血管语义的区分性。

Result: VasoMIM在三个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VasoMIM通过整合血管解剖知识到预训练中，显著提升了X射线血管造影图像的分割性能，展示了其在临床分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

TL;DR: OF-Diff通过提取物体先验形状和双分支扩散模型，显著提升遥感图像生成的保真度和多样性，实验证明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感图像生成中因难以捕捉形态细节而导致低保真图像，影响物体检测模型的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: 提出了Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff)，首次基于布局提取物体先验形状，并引入双分支扩散模型和扩散一致性损失，无需在采样阶段提供真实图像即可生成高保真遥感图像。此外，采用DDPO微调扩散过程，增强生成图像的多样性和语义一致性。

Result: OF-Diff在关键质量指标上优于现有方法，尤其在多态和小物体类别上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: OF-Diff显著提升了遥感图像生成的准确性和保真度，尤其在多态和小物体类别上表现突出，如飞机、船只和车辆的mAP分别提高了8.3%、7.7%和4.0%。

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on

Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%

carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BaCon-Stereo，一种基于对比学习的自监督立体匹配方法，通过教师-学生范式和多基线输入提升遮挡区域性能，在KITTI基准测试中领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前自监督立体匹配在遮挡区域因光度一致性假设失效而性能下降的问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生范式，结合多基线输入和遮挡感知注意力图，利用教师模型在遮挡区域的预测来指导学生模型。

Result: BaCon-Stereo在KITTI 2015和2012基准测试中表现优异，具有强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo通过对比学习框架在多基线输入下，显著提升了自监督立体匹配网络在遮挡和非遮挡区域的性能，并在KITTI基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私保护和分布式协作训练中至关重要。尽管已有工作TransFed在非独立同分布和跨域设置中表现优异，但仍需进一步探索焦点调制在可泛化联邦学习中的潜力，并解决服务器与客户端通信开销的问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前视频生成技术虽能生成高质量视频，但难以保证物理规律的真实性和准确性，限制了需要真实感和精确性的应用场景。

Method: PhysHPO 通过分层跨模态直接偏好优化框架，在四个层次粒度上优化视频对齐：实例级别、状态级别、运动级别和语义级别。此外，引入自动数据选择管道高效利用现有大规模文本-视频数据集中的‘好数据’。

Result: 在物理聚焦和通用能力基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PhysHPO 显著提升了先进模型的物理合理性和整体视频生成质量。

Conclusion: PhysHPO 是首个探索细粒度偏好对齐和数据选择用于视频生成的工作，为更真实和符合人类偏好的视频生成范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

Motivation: 现有多视图重建方法要么依赖昂贵的全局优化，要么采用简单的内存机制，难以扩展序列长度。STream3R旨在解决这些问题，提供高效的流式处理能力。

Method: STream3R采用了一种基于解码器仅Transformer的流式框架，利用因果注意力高效处理图像序列，并学习大规模3D数据集的几何先验。

Result: 实验表明，STream3R在静态和动态场景基准测试中均优于现有方法，且与LLM风格训练基础设施兼容，支持大规模预训练和微调。

Conclusion: STream3R通过因果Transformer模型展示了在线3D感知的潜力，为实时3D理解在流式环境中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

Conclusion: MAESTRO在强依赖多时间动态的任务上设定了新的最先进水平，同时在单时间模态主导的任务上保持高度竞争力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target

observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal

Motivation: 现有的视频类增量学习方法存在记忆效率低或牺牲关键时间信息导致性能下降的问题，ESSENTIAL旨在解决这一权衡问题。

Method: ESSENTIAL采用情景记忆存储时间稀疏特征和语义记忆存储可学习提示表示的通用知识，通过新型记忆检索模块（MR）利用交叉注意力整合两者，从而从时间稀疏特征中检索出时间密集特征。

Result: 在多个数据集（UCF-101、HMDB51、Something-Something-V2等）上验证，ESSENTIAL在显著减少内存占用的同时保持了优越性能。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL通过结合情景记忆和语义记忆，有效解决了视频类增量学习中的记忆效率与性能之间的权衡问题，显著减少了内存占用并保持了优越的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model

challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

TL;DR: QVF是一种新型量子视觉场学习方法，通过改进的量子编码和电路设计，在视觉表示任务中超越现有方法，并展示了实际应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对QINRs在架构设计、量子力学特性利用、训练效率及与经典模块交互方面的挑战，提出QVF以提升视觉场学习的性能。

Method: QVF通过神经振幅编码将经典数据嵌入量子态向量，采用完全纠缠的可学习参数化量子电路设计，在真实希尔伯特空间中进行量子操作，实现稳定训练和快速收敛。

Result: 实验证明QVF在视觉表示准确性上优于现有量子方法和经典基线，尤其在细节学习方面表现突出，并展示了在2D和3D场补全及3D形状插值中的应用。

Conclusion: QVF展示了在2D和3D视觉场学习中的优越性能，超越了现有量子方法和经典基线，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于WiFi和osmAG的室内定位框架，显著提高了定位精度和空间效率，尤其在无指纹数据区域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPS信号在室内环境中不可用，因此需要一种新的定位框架。

Method: 离线阶段通过迭代优化算法定位WiFi接入点（APs），在线阶段利用增强的osmAG地图进行实时机器人定位。

Result: 离线阶段APs定位的平均误差为3.79米（比三边测量法提高35.3%），在线阶段在指纹区域的定位平均误差为3.12米（比KNN指纹法提高8.77%），在非指纹区域为3.83米（提高81.05%）。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个可扩展、经济高效的室内机器人定位解决方案，解决了机器人被劫持问题。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Global localization is essential for autonomous robotics, especially in
indoor environments where the GPS signal is denied. We propose a novel
WiFi-based localization framework that leverages ubiquitous wireless
infrastructure and the OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for large-scale indoor
environments. Our approach integrates signal propagation modeling with osmAG's
geometric and topological priors. In the offline phase, an iterative
optimization algorithm localizes WiFi Access Points (APs) by modeling wall
attenuation, achieving a mean localization error of 3.79 m (35.3\% improvement
over trilateration). In the online phase, real-time robot localization uses the
augmented osmAG map, yielding a mean error of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas
(8.77\% improvement over KNN fingerprinting) and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted
areas (81.05\% improvement). Comparison with a fingerprint-based method shows
that our approach is much more space efficient and achieves superior
localization accuracy, especially for positions where no fingerprint data are
available. Validated across a complex 11,025 &m^2& multi-floor environment,
this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor robotic
localization, solving the kidnapped robot problem. The code and dataset are

Conclusion: ST-GCS在动态环境中能够生成最优无碰撞轨迹，且在静态环境中与标准GCS等效。

Abstract: In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories
through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal
constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult.
Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of
Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance
collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver.
We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and
document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the
framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard
GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating
in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.

Abstract: Robust bipedal locomotion in exoskeletons requires the ability to dynamically
react to changes in the environment in real time. This paper introduces the
hybrid data-driven predictive control (HDDPC) framework, an extension of the

simultaneously planning foot contact schedules and continuous domain

representation to model system dynamics, incorporating step-to-step (S2S)
transitions to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments. By integrating
contact scheduling with trajectory planning, the framework offers an efficient,
unified solution for locomotion motion synthesis that enables robust and
reactive walking through online replanning. We validate the approach on the
Atalante exoskeleton, demonstrating improved robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: ReconVLA通过隐式接地范式显著提升了视觉-语言-动作模型的视觉注意力分配能力，实现了精确操作和泛化能力的提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

Abstract: This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive
Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking
in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to
efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal
strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral
Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an
objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking
based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides
theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and
practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across
DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length
and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven
navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious

Conclusion: FAVOR方法通过结合视觉强化学习，显著提升了多模态大型语言模型在少样本人类活动识别中的泛化能力和推理能力，并在多个数据集和设置中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large reasoning models enables learning from
feedback on their outputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where
fine-tuning data is limited. However, its application in multi-modal human
activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work
extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with
multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement
learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on
few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual
reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable
explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human
activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR.
Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image,
each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then
evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized
using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the
MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few
samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and
five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a
larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,
maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,
many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in
some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic
research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in
the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by
researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart
system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot
interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that
reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is
solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a
modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers
and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of
the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa
Motoman GP4.

Abstract: Upper-limb exoskeletons are primarily designed to provide assistive support
by accurately interpreting and responding to human intentions. In home-care
scenarios, exoskeletons are expected to adapt their assistive configurations
based on the semantic information of the task, adjusting appropriately in
accordance with the nature of the object being manipulated. However, existing
solutions often lack the ability to understand task semantics or
collaboratively plan actions with the user, limiting their generalizability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces a semantic-aware framework that
integrates large language models into the task planning framework, enabling the
delivery of safe and intent-integrative assistance. The proposed approach
begins with the exoskeleton operating in transparent mode to capture the
wearer's intent during object grasping. Once semantic information is extracted
from the task description, the system automatically configures appropriate
assistive parameters. In addition, a diffusion-based anomaly detector is used
to continuously monitor the state of human-robot interaction and trigger
real-time replanning in response to detected anomalies. During task execution,
online trajectory refinement and impedance control are used to ensure safety
and regulate human-robot interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method effectively aligns with the wearer's cognition, adapts to
semantically varying tasks, and responds reliably to anomalies.

Motivation: 传统上，主动光学传感通常被视为测量而非视觉的默认模态，但现代传感器技术和数据驱动范式使其能够重新定义视觉的边界。低成本LiDAR的稀疏数据限制了其广泛应用，因此需要解决这一问题。

Method: 论文介绍了一种针对NRS-LiDAR的密集化网络，包括反射率校准和从静态到动态场景域的转换，以在真实场景中重建密集反射图像。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种创新框架，通过利用非重复扫描LiDAR（NRS-LiDAR）的独特属性，从稀疏数据生成密集LiDAR反射图像，解决了低成本LiDAR数据稀疏性的关键挑战。

Abstract: Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive
optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as
measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation
now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active
optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of
active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance
from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination
conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such
as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities,
typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge
with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their
broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an
innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse
data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR
(NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration
and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the
reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key
contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR
reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for
NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane
detection using the generated dense reflectance images.

on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning
in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

Conclusion: KDPE通过基于核密度估计的策略有效过滤了Diffusion Policy输出的潜在有害轨迹，同时在测试时保持较低的计算开销，从而在模拟单臂任务和真实机器人实验中实现了优于Diffusion Policy的性能。

Abstract: Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has
been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches
tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with
generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on
a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.
While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that
may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,
the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of
generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,
it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work
focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either
with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.
Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that
filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while
keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,
we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for
actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper
state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on
simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

Conclusion: MLM框架通过结合真实世界和仿真数据，成功实现了六自由度机械臂四足机器人的全身运动操控，并在多任务执行中表现出色。

Abstract: Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a
challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address
this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both
real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped
quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks
autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing
multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a
trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This
approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected
trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment
scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of
policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a
Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future
trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and
curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in
simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in
simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while
real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate
the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs提升了人机交互质量，但与人人交互相比仍存在不足，且失败案例的性质和严重性因情境而异，难以泛化。现有研究常忽略这些失败案例的文档化。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于个人经验的民族志小故事撰写方法，用于明确展示HRI系统中的失败案例，并强调了该方法的多学科视角优势。

Result: 通过民族志小故事，论文展示了如何有效记录和传达HRI系统中的失败案例，促进了对机器人能力的透明度，并补充了现有交互评估方法的不足。

Conclusion: 论文提倡在HRI研究中采用民族志小故事（ethnographic vignettes）作为补充评估方法，以更全面地揭示和记录人机交互中的失败案例，特别是那些通常被忽略的意外行为。

Abstract: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent
of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal
when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of
failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be
generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been
implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique
overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight
these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the
methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on
our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the
strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a
multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of
robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted
from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing
interaction evaluation methods.

Motivation: 尽管DNN在控制方面具有高精度和低计算成本的优势，但重型轮式移动机器人在严格国际标准和易受干扰的环境下部署仍具挑战性。

Method: 设计了一个分层控制策略，包括作为主控策略的DNN和作为安全层的RAC策略，以及一个高级安全层进行持续监控。

Result: 提出的方法在6,000公斤的WMR上通过实时实验验证，确保了系统的稳定性和安全性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种结合DNN和RAC策略的分层控制方法，确保了重型轮式移动机器人系统的稳定性和安全性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low
computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However,
the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty
wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international
standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical
control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with
differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and
deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance
under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach
a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined
threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary
control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)
policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring
stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system
robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a
high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during
operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently
severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would
jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC
policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while
adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg
WMR.

Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized
simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic
fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic
materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise
levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface
using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed
to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material
properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real
time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it
aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four
benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -
demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible
to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine
accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard
finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of
magnetic soft robots.

Result: 通过广泛的实验验证，该方法能够显著影响机器人在探索过程中的行为。

Conclusion: 通过使用显著性区域来偏置广泛使用的探索策略，该方法显著影响了机器人在探索过程中的行为，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a widely studied problem where a robot
incrementally builds a map of a previously unknown environment. The robot
selects the next locations to reach using an exploration strategy. To do so,
the robot has to balance between competing objectives, like exploring the
entirety of the environment, while being as fast as possible. Most exploration
strategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,
they do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than
others, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a
method that identifies \emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high
interest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network
that, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate
whether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not. We use
saliency areas to bias some widely used exploration strategies, showing, with
an extensive experimental campaign, that this knowledge can significantly
influence the behavior of the robot during exploration.

Motivation: 现代机器人系统的高冗余性使其能够同时执行多个任务，但传统的任务堆栈（SoT）需要专家手动设计，限制了其适应性和可访问性。

Method: 结合强化学习和遗传编程，系统自动学习任务优先级和控制策略，无需人工干预。学习过程由基于直观指标（如精度、安全性和执行时间）的成本函数指导。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂机器人提供了一种通用且用户友好的冗余管理解决方案，推进了以人为中心的机器人编程，并减少了对专家设计的依赖。

Abstract: Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial
robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform
multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving
reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks
(SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified
framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting
their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework
that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from
user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic
Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies
without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as
precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate
our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a
dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned
SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs,
balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This
approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy
management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and
reducing the need for expert design.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统的部署引发了对安全性和可信度的担忧，尤其是感知可靠性问题，可能导致事故并削弱公众信任。

Method: 通过设计 SET State Trees 和 SET Factor Trees 来分类和分析感知失败的来源及其影响，并开发 Perceptual Factor Models 量化不确定性。

Result: 提出了 SET Perceptual Factors Framework，系统地分析了环境因素（如天气、遮挡或传感器限制）对感知的负面影响。

Conclusion: SET Perceptual Factors Framework 提供了一种透明且标准化的方法，用于识别、建模和传达感知风险，旨在增强自动驾驶系统的安全保证和公众信任。

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

Method: 开发了一种自定义的多模态注意力网络，基于情感识别文献中的模型，并在一个大型自收集的自我披露视频语料库上训练该模型，同时构建了一种新的损失函数——尺度保持交叉熵损失。

Result: 最佳模型在新型损失函数的训练下，F1分数达到0.83，比最佳基线模型提高了0.48。

Conclusion: 通过开发一种基于情感识别文献的多模态注意力网络，并结合新的损失函数（尺度保持交叉熵损失），本研究在建模人类与机器人伙伴的主观自我披露方面取得了显著进展，F1分数达到0.83，比基线模型提高了0.48。

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

Motivation: UWB辅助VIO系统中的不一致性主要由两个因素引起：系统可观测性未正确保持和UWB锚点位置假设已知导致的校准不确定性忽视。

Method: 提出了一种基于Lie群的紧密耦合视觉-惯性-测距里程计（CVIRO）系统，将UWB锚点状态纳入系统状态，并利用不变误差特性确保可观测一致性。

Result: CVIRO在仿真和实验中表现出优于现有方法的定位精度和一致性。

Conclusion: CVIRO系统通过Lie群方法有效解决了UWB辅助VIO系统中的一致性问题，显著提升了定位精度和一致性。

Abstract: Ultra Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation
accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade
localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two
main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system
observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to
improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system
based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the
system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and
enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.
Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant
error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO
algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,
thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and
experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and
consistency compared to existing methods.

Method: 提出了一种基于优势演员-评论家（A2C）算法的强化学习框架，通过马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）在自定义的OpenAI Gymnasium环境中模拟轨道动力学，逐步学习调整五个轨道参数以实现目标地面覆盖。

Result: 与近端策略优化（PPO）相比，A2C算法表现出更优的性能，实现了5.8倍的累积奖励提升（10.0 vs 9.263025），并在31.5倍更少的时序步中收敛（2,000 vs 63,000）。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了强化学习作为一种计算高效的方法，适用于可扩展且智能的低地球轨道（LEO）任务规划。

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

Motivation: 解决现有混合方法在崩溃容忍和拜占庭容忍系统部分组合上的灵活性不足及多样化开销大的问题。

Method: 利用ShellFT框架，系统设计者可以自由选择需要抵抗拜占庭故障的复制逻辑部分。

Result: 与传统混合方法相比，ShellFT能将多样化成本降低70%以上。

Conclusion: ShellFT框架通过微复制概念，显著降低了多样化成本，并提供了比传统混合方法更高的灵活性。

Abstract: Hybrid fault models are known to be an effective means for enhancing the
robustness of consensus-based replicated systems. However, existing
hybridization approaches suffer from limited flexibility with regard to the
composition of crash-tolerant and Byzantine fault-tolerant system parts and/or
are associated with a significant diversification overhead. In this paper we
address these issues with ShellFT, a framework that leverages the concept of
micro replication to allow system designers to freely choose the parts of the
replication logic that need to be resilient against Byzantine faults. As a key
benefit, such a selective hybridization makes it possible to develop hybrid
solutions that are tailored to the specific characteristics and requirements of
individual use cases. To illustrate this flexibility, we present three custom
ShellFT protocols and analyze the complexity of their implementations. Our
evaluation shows that compared with traditional hybridization approaches,
ShellFT is able to decrease diversification costs by more than 70%.

Abstract: The hardware diversity displayed in leadership-class computing facilities,
alongside the immense performance boosts exhibited by today's GPUs when

workflows to adopt mixed-precision algorithms and performance portability
models. We present an on-the-fly framework using Hipify for performance
portability and apply it to FFTMatvec-an HPC application that computes
matrix-vector products with block-triangular Toeplitz matrices. Our approach
enables FFTMatvec, initially a CUDA-only application, to run seamlessly on AMD
GPUs with excellent observed performance. Performance optimizations for AMD
GPUs are integrated directly into the open-source rocBLAS library, keeping the
application code unchanged. We then present a dynamic mixed-precision framework
for FFTMatvec; a Pareto front analysis determines the optimal mixed-precision
configuration for a desired error tolerance. Results are shown for AMD Instinct
MI250X, MI300X, and the newly launched MI355X GPUs. The performance-portable,
mixed-precision FFTMatvec is scaled to 2,048 GPUs on the OLCF Frontier

Abstract: Particle-based simulations and point-cloud applications generate massive,
irregular datasets that challenge storage, I/O, and real-time analytics.
Traditional compression techniques struggle with irregular particle
distributions and GPU architectural constraints, often resulting in limited
throughput and suboptimal compression ratios. In this paper, we present GPZ, a
high-performance, error-bounded lossy compressor designed specifically for
large-scale particle data on modern GPUs. GPZ employs a novel four-stage
parallel pipeline that synergistically balances high compression efficiency
with the architectural demands of massively parallel hardware. We introduce a

occupancy that enables GPZ to achieve near-hardware-limit throughput. We
conduct an extensive evaluation on three distinct GPU architectures
(workstation, data center, and edge) using six large-scale, real-world
scientific datasets from five distinct domains. The results demonstrate that
GPZ consistently and significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art GPU
compressors, delivering up to 8x higher end-to-end throughput while
simultaneously achieving superior compression ratios and data quality.

Collaborative learning can leverage local clients' datasets for fine-tuning,

personalized model performance on global data. Experimental results show that
FlexP-SFL outperforms baseline models in personalized fine-tuning efficiency
and final accuracy.

Conclusion: CQ和CQ-SimBE的开源发布为量子计算在经典HPC代码中的逐步集成提供了工具和实验平台。

Abstract: In this paper we present CQ, a specification for a C-like API for quantum
accelerated HPC, as well as CQ-SimBE, a reference implementation of CQ written
in C99, and built on top of the statevector simulator QuEST. CQ focuses on
enabling the incremental integration of quantum computing into classical HPC
codes by supporting runtime offloading from languages such as C and Fortran. It
provides a way of describing and offloading quantum computations which is
compatible with strictly and strongly typed compiled languages, and gives the
programmer fine-grained control over classical data movement. The CQ Simulated
Backend (CQ-SimBE) provides both a way to demonstrate the usage and utility of
CQ, and a space to experiment with new features such as support for analogue
quantum computing. Both the CQ specification and CQ-SimBE are open-source, and
available in public repositories.

*Huck Bennett,Karthik Gajulapalli,Alexander Golovnev,Evelyn Warton*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文提出两种OSMM算法（确定性和随机性），在完全稀疏设置下优化性能，时间复杂度优于现有方法，随机算法简单且最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决输出稀疏矩阵乘法（OSMM）问题，即当乘积矩阵AB的非零条目数量有限时，如何高效计算矩阵乘法。

Method: 第一种是确定性算法，通过两阶段压缩感知减少问题规模，时间复杂度约为n^ω(δ/2,1,1)。第二种是随机算法，结合压缩感知和矩阵乘法验证的变体，时间复杂度约为n^ω(δ−1,1,1)。

Result: 提出的确定性算法显著优于现有算法，随机算法在时间复杂度上与最新研究（Abboud et al., 2024）相当但更简单。同时证明了随机算法的时间复杂度是最优的。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了两种输出稀疏矩阵乘法（OSMM）的算法，并在完全稀疏设置下进一步优化。两种算法均适用于任意环，且在时间复杂度上优于现有确定性算法。

Abstract: We give two algorithms for output-sparse matrix multiplication (OSMM), the
problem of multiplying two $n \times n$ matrices $A, B$ when their product $AB$
is promised to have at most $O(n^{\delta})$ many non-zero entries for a given
value $\delta \in [0, 2]$. We then show how to speed up these algorithms in the
fully sparse setting, where the input matrices $A, B$ are themselves sparse.
All of our algorithms work over arbitrary rings.
  Our first, deterministic algorithm for OSMM works via a two-pass reduction to
compressed sensing. It runs in roughly $n^{\omega(\delta/2, 1, 1)}$ time, where
$\omega(\cdot, \cdot, \cdot)$ is the rectangular matrix multiplication
exponent. This substantially improves on prior deterministic algorithms for
output-sparse matrix multiplication.
  Our second, randomized algorithm for OSMM works via a reduction to compressed
sensing and a variant of matrix multiplication verification, and runs in
roughly $n^{\omega(\delta - 1, 1, 1)}$ time. This algorithm and its extension
to the fully sparse setting have running times that match those of the
(randomized) algorithms for OSMM and FSMM, respectively, in recent work of
Abboud, Bringmann, Fischer, and K\"{u}nnemann (SODA, 2024). Our algorithm uses
different techniques and is arguably simpler.
  Finally, we observe that the running time of our randomized algorithm and the
algorithm of Abboud et al. are optimal via a simple reduction from rectangular
matrix multiplication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 树覆盖在图算法中具有重要作用，但现有研究在失真下界与上界之间存在较大差距，需进一步缩小。

Method: 采用组合不动点定理对网格状图进行新颖分析，改进树覆盖的失真下界。

Result: 改进了树覆盖的失真下界至Ω(n^(1/2^{k-1}))。

Conclusion: 本文通过分析一种结构简单的网格状图，利用组合不动点定理，改进了树覆盖的失真下界至Ω(n^(1/2^{k-1}))，为树状数据结构的研究提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: Given an $n$-point metric space $(X,d_X)$, a tree cover $\mathcal{T}$ is a
set of $|\mathcal{T}|=k$ trees on $X$ such that every pair of vertices in $X$
has a low-distortion path in one of the trees in $\mathcal{T}$. Tree covers
have been playing a crucial role in graph algorithms for decades, and the
research focus is the construction of tree covers with small size $k$ and
distortion.
  When $k=1$, the best distortion is known to be $\Theta(n)$. For a constant
$k\ge 2$, the best distortion upper bound is $\tilde O(n^{\frac 1 k})$ and the
strongest lower bound is $\Omega(\log_k n)$, leaving a gap to be closed. In
this paper, we improve the lower bound to $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}})$.
  Our proof is a novel analysis on a structurally simple grid-like graph, which
utilizes some combinatorial fixed-point theorems. We believe that they will
prove useful for analyzing other tree-like data structures as well.

Conclusion: 本文证明了在时间图的底层静态图具有有限树宽时，最大0-1时间匹配问题仍然是NP完全的，并且当参数化为解的大小时，问题是W[1]-难的。此外，提出了一个固定参数可解（FPT）算法，用于解决当问题参数化为时间图底层图的最大顶点度和树宽时的最大0-1时间匹配问题。

Abstract: Temporal graphs are introduced to model systems where the relationships among
the entities of the system evolve over time. In this paper, we consider the
temporal graphs where the edge set changes with time and all the changes are
known a priori. The underlying graph of a temporal graph is a static graph
consisting of all the vertices and edges that exist for at least one timestep
in the temporal graph. The concept of 0-1 timed matching in temporal graphs was
introduced by Mandal and Gupta [DAM2022] as an extension of the matching
problem in static graphs. A 0-1 timed matching of a temporal graph is a
non-overlapping subset of the edge set of that temporal graph. The problem of
finding the maximum 0-1 timed matching is proved to be NP-complete on multiple
classes of temporal graphs. We study the fixed-parameter tractability of the
maximum 0-1 timed matching problem. We prove that the problem remains to be
NP-complete even when the underlying static graph of the temporal graph has a
bounded treewidth. Furthermore, we establish that the problem is W[1]-hard when
parameterized by the solution size. Finally, we present a fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT) algorithm to address the problem when the problem is
parameterized by the maximum vertex degree and the treewidth of the underlying
graph of the temporal graph.

Motivation: 最小化平面上隐藏点目标的最坏情况搜索时间，通过多速度移动代理实现。

Method: 扩展单单位速度代理的已知结果至n个单位速度代理，提出对称螺旋算法，并给出任意速度代理的搜索时间上界框架。

Result: 提出了n个任意速度代理的搜索时间上界，证明多速度代理可超越单位速度代理的性能，若其几何平均速度足够高。

Conclusion: 螺旋型轨迹在多速度代理设置中可能非最优，混合螺旋-定向策略在部分代理速度较慢时表现更优。

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the worst-case search time for a hidden
point target in the plane using multiple mobile agents of differing speeds, all
starting from a common origin. The search time is normalized by the target's
distance to the origin, following the standard convention in competitive
analysis. The goal is to minimize the maximum such normalized time over all
target locations, the search cost. As a base case, we extend the known result
for a single unit-speed agent, which achieves an optimal cost of about
$\mathcal{U}_1 = 17.28935$ via a logarithmic spiral, to $n$ unit-speed agents.
We give a symmetric spiral-based algorithm where each agent follows a
logarithmic spiral offset by equal angular phases. This yields a search cost
independent of which agent finds the target. We provide a closed-form upper
bound $\mathcal{U}_n$ for this setting, which we use in our general result. Our
main contribution is an upper bound on the worst-case normalized search time
for $n$ agents with arbitrary speeds. We give a framework that selects a subset
of agents and assigns spiral-type trajectories with speed-dependent angular
offsets, again making the search cost independent of which agent reaches the
target. A corollary shows that $n$ multi-speed agents (fastest speed 1) can
beat $k$ unit-speed agents (cost below $\mathcal{U}_k$) if the geometric mean
of their speeds exceeds $\mathcal{U}_n / \mathcal{U}_k$. This means slow agents
may be excluded if they lower the mean too much, motivating non-spiral
algorithms. We also give new upper bounds for point search in cones and conic
complements using a single unit-speed agent. These are then used to design
hybrid spiral-directional strategies, which outperform the spiral-based
algorithms when some agents are slow. This suggests that spiral-type
trajectories may not be optimal in the general multi-speed setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究完全动态环境下的聚类问题，旨在维护近似最优解的同时最小化中心点的调整次数（recourse）。

Method: 采用Positive Body Chasing框架，将问题转化为在线分数解，并通过舍入技术保持近似和recourse保证。

Result: 设计了算法，能够在保持O(β)近似解的同时，总recourse为O(log |F| log Δ) · OPT_rec^β，并通过对数下界证明其近乎最优。

Conclusion: 本文通过将动态聚类问题转化为Positive Body Chasing框架，成功设计出在保持近似解的同时最小化recourse的算法，并通过对数下界验证了其近乎最优性。

Abstract: In fully-dynamic consistent clustering, we are given a finite metric space
$(M,d)$, and a set $F\subseteq M$ of possible locations for opening centers.
Data points arrive and depart, and the goal is to maintain an approximately
optimal clustering solution at all times while minimizing the recourse, the
total number of additions/deletions of centers over time. Specifically, we
study fully dynamic versions of the classical $k$-center, facility location,
and $k$-median problems. We design algorithms that, given a parameter
$\beta\geq 1$, maintain an $O(\beta)$-approximate solution at all times, and
whose total recourse is bounded by $O(\log |F| \log \Delta) \cdot
\text{OPT}_\text{rec}^{\beta}$. Here $\text{OPT}_\text{rec}^{\beta}$ is the
minimal recourse of an offline algorithm that maintains a $\beta$-approximate
solution at all times, and $\Delta$ is the metric aspect ratio. Finally, while
we compare the performance of our algorithms to an optimal solution that
maintains $k$ centers, our algorithms are allowed to use slightly more than $k$
centers. We obtain our results via a reduction to the recently proposed
Positive Body Chasing framework of [Bhattacharya, Buchbinder, Levin, Saranurak,
FOCS 2023], which we show gives fractional solutions to our clustering problems
online. Our contribution is to round these fractional solutions while
preserving the approximation and recourse guarantees. We complement our
positive results with logarithmic lower bounds which show that our bounds are
nearly tight.

TL;DR: 在5G测试床中集成实时网络编码系统，证明RLNC比传统ARQ/HARQ更高效，能在中高丢包率下保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提供一个替代传统基于重传的可靠性机制（如ARQ和HARQ）的方案，以优化5G网络中的吞吐量、抖动和资源使用。

Method: 通过基于netfilter的数据包拦截框架，在5G测试床的IP层中集成实时网络编码系统，使用随机线性网络编码（RLNC）在gNB和UE之间的实时流量中注入前向纠错。

Result: 结果显示，通过适当的码率选择，RLNC能以比ARQ/HARQ更少的传输次数完全恢复丢包，并在中高丢包率下保持高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 网络编码可以有效替代未来无线系统中的基于重传的可靠性机制，具有更高效资源利用的潜力。

Abstract: This work presents the design and implementation of a real-time network
coding system integrated into the IP layer of a 5G testbed, offering an
alternative to conventional retransmission-based reliability mechanisms such as
ARQ and HARQ. Using a netfilter-based packet interception framework, we inject
forward erasure correction using Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) into live
traffic between a gNB and UE over a 3GPP RF link. We evaluate a block coding
scheme, analyzing its impact on throughput, jitter, and resource usage. Results
show that with appropriate code rate selection, RLNC can fully recover from
packet losses using fewer transmissions than ARQ/HARQ and maintain a high
throughput, particularly under moderate-to-high packet loss rates. These
findings demonstrate that network coding can effectively replace
retransmission-based reliability in future wireless systems, with the potential
for more efficient resource utilization.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于脉动阵列和移位寄存器的混合架构硬件优先级队列，有效解决大规模定时器管理的精度和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模定时器在网络处理中广泛应用，但传统实现存在定时精度低和计算开销高的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于脉动阵列和移位寄存器的混合架构硬件优先级队列，支持五种操作：入队、出队、删除、更新和查看，并首次实现队列内优先级更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，该设计在FPGA上运行频率超过400 MHz，资源消耗显著降低。

Conclusion: 该设计在FPGA上运行频率超过400 MHz，资源消耗比现有最佳实现减少2.2-2.8倍，展示了高效的大规模定时器管理能力。

Abstract: Large-scale timers are ubiquitous in network processing, including flow table
entry expiration control in software defined network (SDN) switches, MAC
address aging in Ethernet bridges, and retransmission timeout management in
TCP/IP protocols. Conventional implementations suffer from critical
limitations: low timing accuracy due to large-scale timer traversal and high
computational overhead for new timer insertion. This paper presents a
hybrid-architecture hardware priority queue based on systolic arrays and shift
registers for efficient timer queue management. The design uniquely supports
five operations: enqueue, dequeue, delete, update, and peek.To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first hardware priority queue enabling in-queue priority
updates. By leveraging centralized Boolean logic encoding within systolic
blocks, the design efficiently generates set/shift control signals while the
novel push-first operation ensures FIFO ordering for same-priority timers
without additional metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the design
operates at over 400 MHz on FPGAs, achieving a 2.2-2.8x reduction in resource
consumption compared to state-of-the-art implementations.

Conclusion: 利用Starlink卫星基础设施支持地球观测卫星的设想是可行的，SSU系统能显著减少数据传输积压。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are collecting
vast amounts of data, which are invaluable for applications such as monitoring
forest fires. However, data downloading from EO satellites faces significant
challenges due to the limited number of ground stations and the brief
communication windows with them. Conversely, emerging LEO constellations like
Starlink have enabled continuous connectivity and revolutionized access for
ordinary users globally, who can connect via a simple satellite dish. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of supporting EO satellites with Starlink
satellite infrastructure and introduce a novel data delivery system, designated
as "Starlink Space User" (SSU), for relaying data from observation satellites.
SSU treats EO satellites as space users of Starlink, facilitating efficient
data transfer to Earth. At the core of SSU is a novel class of algorithms
designed for link and PoP selection, as well as system scheduling optimization,
that operate effectively atop Starlink's proprietary infrastructure. We assess
the performance of SSU using trace-driven simulations alongside real-world
Starlink performance measurements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
Starlink-aided design can significantly reduce the median backlog (data not
delivered) per satellite.

Result: 在 270 种场景中验证了 PLA，显示分析预测与实验结果高度一致。

Conclusion: PLA 提供了一个理论基础，用于系统地优化无线工业机器人中的可靠性、延迟和性能。

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is now the de facto standard for robotic
communication, pairing UDP transport with the Data Distribution Service (DDS)
publish-subscribe middleware. DDS achieves reliability through periodic
heartbeats that solicit acknowledgments for missing samples and trigger
selective retransmissions. In lossy wireless networks, the tight coupling among
heartbeat period, IP fragmentation, and retransmission interval obscures end to
end latency behavior and leaves practitioners with little guidance on how to
tune these parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic
latency analysis (PLA) that analytically models the reliable transmission
process of ROS 2 DDS communication using a discrete state approach. By
systematically analyzing both middleware level and transport level events, PLA
computes the steady state probability distribution of unacknowledged messages
and the retransmission latency. We validate our PLA across 270 scenarios,
exploring variations in packet delivery ratios, message sizes, and both
publishing and retransmission intervals, demonstrating a close alignment
between analytical predictions and experimental results. Our findings establish
a theoretical basis to systematically optimize reliability, latency, and
performance in wireless industrial robotics.

Conclusion: 研究强调了前向帧擦除纠正（FEC）在LoRa网络上实现联邦学习的关键作用，并深入评估了FEC对FL收敛和设备通信时间的影响，为LoRa网络上的FL通信协议设计提供了见解。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) over long-range (LoRa) low-power wide area networks
faces unique challenges due to limited bandwidth, interference, and strict
duty-cycle constraints. We develop a Python-based simulator that integrates and
extends the Flower and LoRaSim frameworks to evaluate centralized FL over LoRa
networks. The simulator employs a detailed link-level model for FL update
transfer over LoRa channels, capturing LoRa's receiver sensitivity,
interference characteristics, block-fading effects, and constraints on the
maximum transmission unit. It supports update sparsification, quantization,
compression, forward frame-erasure correction (FEC), and duty cycling.
Numerical results illustrate the impact of transmission parameters (spreading
factor, FEC rate) and interference on FL performance. Demonstrating the
critical role of FEC in enabling FL over LoRa networks, we perform an in-depth
evaluation of the impact of FEC on FL convergence and device airtime, providing
insights for communication protocol design for FL over LoRa networks.

Motivation: LoRaWAN终端设备通常能量受限，且传输受限于占空比限制，因此控制固件更新的能量消耗和交付延迟是关键挑战。

Method: 采用LoRa扩展因子顺序传输更新帧，固定每个扩展因子的传输次数后切换到下一个扩展因子。通过调整最小扩展因子和每个扩展因子的传输次数，实现能量与延迟的平衡。

Result: 提出的方案能够在能量消耗和交付延迟之间实现可调折衷，适用于紧急和非紧急更新。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种灵活的方案，通过调整LoRa扩展因子和每个扩展因子的传输次数，实现了能量消耗与交付延迟之间的可调折衷。这种方法适用于不同紧急程度的固件更新。

Abstract: Over-the-air firmware updates are crucial for mitigating security threats and
maintaining up-to-date device functionality in Long Range Wide Area Networks
(LoRaWANs). LoRaWAN end devices are usually energy-constrained, and LoRaWAN
transmissions are subject to duty-cycle restrictions. Consequently, controlling
the energy expenditure and update-delivery latency of FUOTA are key challenges.
We propose a flexible scheme that achieves a tunable trade-off between the
energy consumption and delivery delay. The scheme employs the LoRa spreading
factors sequentially to transmit update-carrying frames, sending a fixed number
of frames with a given spreading factor before moving to the next. By adjusting
the smallest spreading factor to be used and the number of transmissions per
spreading factor, a suitable energy-delay trade-off can be achieved. Thus,
time-sensitive updates, such as security patches, may be sent with a
low-delay-high-energy setting, whereas a more energy-efficient but higher-delay
setting may be used for non-critical updates.

for the base model, inference frameworks, benchmark datasets, and performance
evaluation. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis on the quality of
benchmark datasets, which was found to have a surprisingly high error rate. We
cleaned the datasets and constructed a new leaderboard with fair performance
evaluation in terms of base LLM model and datasets. We also build an online
portal that integrates resources of cleaned datasets, code and paper repository
to benefit the community. Finally, we identify limitations in current
methodologies and outline future research opportunities.

Abstract: AI systems for software development are rapidly gaining prominence, yet
significant challenges remain in ensuring their safety. To address this, Amazon
launched the Trusted AI track of the Amazon Nova AI Challenge, a global
competition among 10 university teams to drive advances in secure AI. In the
challenge, five teams focus on developing automated red teaming bots, while the
other five create safe AI assistants. This challenge provides teams with a
unique platform to evaluate automated red-teaming and safety alignment methods
through head-to-head adversarial tournaments where red teams have multi-turn
conversations with the competing AI coding assistants to test their safety
alignment. Along with this, the challenge provides teams with a feed of high
quality annotated data to fuel iterative improvement. Throughout the challenge,
teams developed state-of-the-art techniques, introducing novel approaches in
reasoning-based safety alignment, robust model guardrails, multi-turn
jail-breaking, and efficient probing of large language models (LLMs). To

scientific and engineering investments, including building a custom baseline
coding specialist model for the challenge from scratch, developing a tournament
orchestration service, and creating an evaluation harness. This paper outlines
the advancements made by university teams and the Amazon Nova AI Challenge team
in addressing the safety challenges of AI for software development,
highlighting this collaborative effort to raise the bar for AI safety.

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

TL;DR: Open-source DRA ODR+ outperforms proprietary systems with a 10% success rate on BC-Small after strategic improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-source Deep Research Agents (DRAs) and compare their performance with proprietary systems.

Method: Adapted the BrowseComp benchmark to create BC-Small, benchmarked ODR and proprietary systems, and introduced three strategic improvements to develop ODR+.

Result: All three systems initially achieved 0% accuracy on BC-Small, but ODR+ improved to 10% success rate.

Conclusion: ODR+ model achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small, outperforming existing closed-source and open-source systems.

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长输出增加了计算成本并可能导致过度思考，当前方法在平衡推理效率和质量时存在不足，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 分析了生成路径分布并通过难度估计过滤生成的轨迹，研究了不同偏好优化方法在Bradley-Terry损失框架下的收敛行为，提出了LCPO方法。

Result: 实验表明，LCPO在多个基准测试中将平均输出长度减少了50%以上，同时保持了推理性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为LCPO的方法，通过直接平衡与NLL损失相关的隐式奖励，有效减少了大型推理模型的输出长度，同时保持了推理性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 现有的LLM-based AutoML系统存在探索策略受限和执行瓶颈问题，KompeteAI旨在解决这些问题。

Method: KompeteAI引入了动态解决方案空间探索，包括合并阶段和检索增强生成（RAG），以扩展假设空间。同时，通过预测评分模型和加速调试方法优化执行效率。

Result: KompeteAI在MLE-Bench上平均优于其他方法3%，并将管道评估速度提升了6.9倍。

Conclusion: KompeteAI通过动态解决方案空间探索和加速调试方法，显著提升了AutoML系统的性能，并在MLE-Bench和Kompete-bench上取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

Motivation: To enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making, and interpretability in AI by leveraging the concept of entropic potential, originally from physics.

Method: The framework adapts the original physics-based concept of entropic potential for AI by introducing an event-centric measure that captures the impact of discrete events on future uncertainty. It formalizes both original and AI-adjusted definitions, emphasizing conditional expectations for counterfactual scenarios.

Result: The framework is applied in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, demonstrating its potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.

Conclusion: The entropic potential framework provides a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile approach to managing uncertainty in AI, integrating principles from thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中取得了显著进展，但存在过度思考问题，即在简单问题上浪费过多计算资源，降低了效率。现有方法需要预设令牌预算或选择推理模式，限制了灵活性和可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种基于规则的可验证逐步奖励机制（VSRM），通过评估推理轨迹中的中间状态性能来分配奖励。该方法与PPO和Reinforce++结合进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，VSRM在标准数学推理基准测试（如AIME24和AIME25）上显著减少了输出长度，同时保持了原始推理性能，有效抑制了无效步骤并鼓励了有效推理。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于规则的VSRM方法通过奖励有效的推理步骤和惩罚无效步骤，有效缓解了大型推理模型（LRMs）的过度思考问题，显著提高了推理效率，同时保持了准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Motivation: To build a comprehensive retrieval-augmented generation system capable of multi-modal multi-turn question answering, addressing challenges in structured data retrieval, information synthesis, and multi-turn conversations.

Method: For Task 1, a vision large language model was enhanced by supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1, applying curriculum learning strategies. Tasks 2 and 3 leveraged web search APIs for external knowledge integration.

Result: Achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a 52.38% lead and 3rd place in Task 3.

Conclusion: The integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning in the training pipeline proved effective, securing 1st place in Task 1 and 3rd place in Task 3.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering

results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn

Motivation: 解决HATRPO中因给所有代理分配相同KL阈值而导致的更新缓慢和局部最优问题，特别是在异质代理设置中。

Method: 提出了两种分配KL散度阈值的方法：基于KKT的HATRPO-W和基于贪心算法的HATRPO-G。

Result: 实验结果表明，HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G在多种MARL基准测试中均显著提升了性能，最终奖励提升超过22.5%。

Conclusion: HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G显著提升了HATRPO的性能，实现了更快的收敛速度和更高的最终奖励，其中HATRPO-W表现出更稳定的学习动态。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Method: 通过基于‘乌龟汤’游戏的综合研究框架，包括基准测试、代理和评估协议，来评估LLMs的表现。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在想象力推理方面存在明显的能力限制和常见失败模式，与人类表现有显著差距。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大型语言模型在想象力推理方面的能力限制，并为其未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

TL;DR: LeanRAG通过语义聚合和结构引导的检索策略，解决了知识图RAG方法中的语义孤立和检索效率问题，显著提升了性能并减少了冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于知识图的RAG方法存在两个关键问题：高层概念摘要作为孤立的“语义岛”存在，缺乏明确的跨社区推理关系；检索过程本身缺乏结构感知，往往退化为低效的扁平搜索，未能充分利用图的丰富拓扑结构。

Method: LeanRAG采用了一种新颖的语义聚合算法，形成实体簇并构建聚合级摘要之间的显式关系，创建了一个完全可导航的语义网络。随后，采用自底向上、结构引导的检索策略，从最相关的细粒度实体出发，系统地遍历图的语义路径以收集简洁但上下文全面的证据集。

Result: 在四个不同领域的QA基准测试中，LeanRAG在响应质量上显著优于现有方法，同时减少了46%的检索冗余。

Conclusion: LeanRAG通过深度协作的知识聚合和检索策略，显著提升了检索增强生成（RAG）的效果，减少了46%的检索冗余，并在多个QA基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

Motivation: 解决现实EHR数据中罕见医疗实体和记录不完整导致的模型泛化能力不足问题。

Method: HiRef框架结合了层次化医学本体和优化的EHR共现图，使用双曲空间嵌入本体实体，并通过先验引导的稀疏正则化方案优化共现图。

Result: HiRef在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV基准测试中表现优异，并在模拟未见代码设置下保持高准确率。

Conclusion: HiRef框架通过结合层次化医学本体和优化的共现模式，显著提升了在缺失或新条件下药物推荐的泛化能力，并在实际EHR数据上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence
dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open
subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images
annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of

contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community
sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is
linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with
a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FIRESPARQL框架通过微调LLM和RAG提升SKG问答任务中SPARQL查询的准确性，测试集表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成SPARQL查询时因SKG特定内容曝光不足和模式复杂性导致的结构不一致和语义不准确问题。

Method: 提出FIRESPARQL模块化框架，结合微调LLM、RAG和SPARQL查询修正层，并在SciQA基准上评估不同配置的性能。

Result: 微调配置表现最佳，测试集上查询准确性（ROUGE-L）达0.90，结果准确性（RelaxedEM）达0.85。

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL框架通过微调LLM、结合RAG和SPARQL查询修正层，显著提升了在SKG上问答任务的表现，尤其是在查询和结果准确性方面。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

Motivation: 当前的空间服务（如在线地图）主要依赖用户查询进行位置搜索，但在执行复杂任务（如同时搜索多个相关位置）时用户体验受限。研究旨在通过大型语言模型（LLMs）的自然语言能力，提升空间范例查询（SEQ）的灵活性和交互性。

Method: 提出了SEQ-GPT系统，这是一个基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的空间查询系统，通过自然语言处理技术实现复杂的空间范例查询（SEQ）。系统采用对话合成和多模型协作的管道，将自然语言与结构化空间数据对齐。

Result: SEQ-GPT系统能够通过自然语言交互实现复杂的空间范例查询，支持用户澄清查询细节和动态调整搜索，有效提升了空间搜索的灵活性和用户体验。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入SEQ-GPT系统，展示了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的自然语言处理能力来扩展空间查询服务，特别是在复杂任务如空间范例查询（SEQ）中。该系统不仅提升了用户体验，还通过对话合成和多模型协作，实现了自然语言与结构化空间数据的有效对齐。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

TL;DR: DxDirector-7B将AI从助手升级为诊断主导者，显著提升准确性和效率，减少医生负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在临床诊断中仅作为助手，无法从模糊主诉驱动全流程诊断，限制了其减轻医生工作量和提升效率的潜力。

Method: 提出DxDirector-7B，一个具备深度思考能力的LLM，能够以最小化医生参与驱动全流程诊断，并建立责任框架。

Result: 在罕见、复杂和真实案例中，DxDirector-7B不仅诊断准确性显著优于现有医疗LLM，还大幅减少医生工作量。

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B标志着AI从医生的助手转变为诊断过程的主导者，显著减少医生工作量，提供高效准确的诊断解决方案。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

TL;DR: PASS 是一个多模态框架，通过概率注释的决策路径和动态推理机制，解决了医疗AI系统中的可解释性、安全性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的代理系统在现实世界中存在黑盒推理步骤、多模态整合不足和计算效率低下等问题，尤其是在医疗领域。

Method: PASS 采用自适应采样代理工作流的方法，结合多工具图，设计了包含专家知识预热、对比路径排序和成本感知强化学习的三阶段训练流程。

Result: PASS 在多个基准测试中显著优于基线模型，如准确率、AUC和LLM-J等指标，同时平衡了计算成本。

Conclusion: PASS 通过其概率注释的决策路径和动态推理机制，显著提升了医疗AI系统的可解释性和安全性，同时在性能和成本之间取得了平衡。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

Conclusion: 论文提出了对齐阶段假设，将语言模型对齐过程分为偏好注入和偏好微调两个阶段，并通过实验验证了该假设的普适性和边界测量的有效性。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

TL;DR: ComMCS方法通过组合MC估计器降低方差，提升LLM在数学推理中的表现，无需额外推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂领域（如数学）中的推理能力仍面临挑战，现有的基于值的过程验证器因训练注释中的估计误差（由于LLM推理成本高导致的MC样本有限）而效果受限。本文发现估计误差主要源于高方差而非偏差，且MC估计器是最小方差无偏估计器（MVUE）。

Method: 提出了ComMCS方法，通过线性组合当前和后续步骤的MC估计器构建无偏估计器，理论上证明了该方法能预测性地降低方差，并保持无偏性。

Result: ComMCS在MATH-500和GSM8K基准测试中表现优异，优于基于回归的优化方法2.8个百分点，优于未降方差的基线2.2个百分点（Best-of-32采样实验）。

Conclusion: ComMCS方法通过线性组合当前和后续步骤的MC估计器，构建了一个无偏估计器，显著降低了方差，且在不需要额外LLM推理成本的情况下保持了无偏性，在MATH-500和GSM8K基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

Conclusion: MSRS通过分配正交子空间和动态加权策略，显著减少了多属性控制中的干扰，优于现有方法，并能有效泛化到多样化下游任务。

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有对话推荐系统在捕捉用户偏好深层语义和对话上下文方面的挑战，特别是外部知识图谱信息的高效集成问题。

Method: 采用预训练语言模型，结合课程引导的上下文-知识融合和三阶段课程学习，通过双提示方案（对话前缀和推荐前缀）注入融合表示。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上，STEP在推荐精度和对话质量上优于主流方法。

Conclusion: STEP模型通过课程引导的上下文-知识融合和轻量级任务特定提示调优，显著提升了对话推荐系统的推荐精度和对话质量。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: 提出的稀疏、目标感知的GNN表示方法有效解决了大规模规划任务中的组合爆炸和信息稀疏问题，为现实中的大规模通用规划任务提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention

### [177] [Modeling Human Responses to Multimodal AI Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10769)
*Zhiqi Shen,Shaojing Fan,Danni Xu,Terence Sim,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过MhAIM数据集和T-Lens系统，量化了用户对AI生成内容的反应，并提出了缓解AI错误信息风险的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的普及，错误信息的风险增加。现有的研究主要集中在识别内容的真实性，而较少关注此类内容如何影响人类感知和行为。在交易或股票市场等领域，预测人们的反应（如新闻帖子是否会走红）可能比验证其事实准确性更为关键。

Method: 采用以人为中心的方法，引入MhAIM数据集（包含154,552个在线帖子，其中111,153个为AI生成），并提出了三个新指标（可信度、影响力和开放性）来量化用户对在线内容的判断和参与度。此外，开发了基于LLM的T-Lens系统，其核心是HR-MCP协议。

Result: 人类研究表明，当帖子包含文本和视觉内容时，人们能更好地识别AI生成内容，尤其是两者之间存在不一致时。T-Lens系统通过HR-MCP协议能够更好地与人类反应对齐，提升了可解释性和交互能力。

Conclusion: 本研究通过提出T-Lens系统和HR-MCP协议，为LLM赋予了人类感知能力，提供了缓解AI驱动错误信息风险的可操作策略。

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [178] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，当前LLMs虽具备临床知识，但缺乏结构化表示来可靠应用，推理能力受限。通过GKMRV探针可明确测量知识与推理的分离，为高风险领域提供评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大规模语言模型是否仅通过扩展数据和参数就能获得越来越结构化、可泛化的内部表示。

Method: 引入了一个包含四种推理家族的临床试验自然语言推理基准（Causal Attribution、Compositional Grounding、Epistemic Verification、Risk State Abstraction），并使用GKMRV探针来区分事实访问失败与推理失败。评估了六种当代LLM在直接提示和思维链提示下的表现。

Result: 模型在GKMRV探针上达到接近天花板的高准确率（平均0.918），但在主要推理任务上表现不佳（平均0.25）。尽管准确率低，输出推理在不同样本间高度一致（平均0.87），表明模型系统性地应用了启发式和捷径。

Conclusion: 当前的LLMs在临床知识上具备相关基础，但缺乏结构化、可组合的内部表示来可靠地应用这些知识（如整合约束、权衡证据或模拟反事实）。通过GKMRV解耦知识与推理，使得这种分离变得明确且可测量，为在高风险领域中探测LLMs的可靠性提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

*Maria J. P. Peixoto,Akriti Pandey,Ahsan Zaman,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨XAI对视觉障碍用户的可访问性，发现简化解释和多模态呈现更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管可解释AI（XAI）的可用性受到关注，但其对视觉障碍用户的可访问性仍未充分探索。

Method: 通过双管齐下的方法：首先对79项研究进行文献综述，其次提出一个四部分的包容性XAI设计方法论验证概念。

Result: 文献综述显示XAI技术评估很少包含残疾用户，且多数解释依赖视觉格式；初步结果表明简化解释和多模态呈现更有效。

Conclusion: 研究发现，简化的解释对非视觉用户更易理解，且多模态呈现是实现更公平可解释性的必要条件。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

*Yilin Liu,Niladri Shekhar Dutt,Changjian Li,Niloy J. Mitra*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出B-repLer，一种针对B-rep CAD模型编辑的微调多模态大型语言模型，通过新型架构和自动生成数据集实现文本驱动的语义编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大型语言模型在图像和文本处理上表现出色，但在3D分析和编辑任务中表现有限，尤其是针对B-rep CAD对象的编辑。本文旨在探索如何适配这些模型以支持高级B-rep编辑。

Method: 通过设计一种新型的多模态架构专门处理B-rep模型，并利用现有CAD工具自动生成推理数据集，无需依赖外部标注。

Result: B-repLer能够实现多种复杂度的文本驱动B-rep编辑，这在之前是不可能的。

Conclusion: B-repLer作为一种经过微调的多模态大型语言模型，能够有效理解文本提示并对B-rep模型进行语义编辑，生成有效输出，填补了3D CAD编辑领域的空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (mLLMs), trained in a mixed modal setting as
a universal model, have been shown to compete with or even outperform many
specialized algorithms for imaging and graphics tasks. As demonstrated across
many applications, mLLMs' ability to jointly process image and text data makes
them suitable for zero-shot applications or efficient fine-tuning towards
specialized tasks. However, they have had limited success in 3D analysis and
editing tasks. This is due to both the lack of suitable (annotated) 3D data as
well as the idiosyncrasies of 3D representations. In this paper, we investigate
whether mLLMs can be adapted to support high-level editing of Boundary
Representation (B-rep) CAD objects. B-reps remain the industry-standard for
precisely encoding engineering objects, but are challenging as the
representation is fragile (i.e. can easily lead to invalid CAD objects) and no
publicly available data source exists with semantically-annotated B-reps or CAD
construction history. We present B-repLer as a finetuned mLLM that can
understand text prompts and make semantic edits on given B-Reps to produce
valid outputs. We enable this via a novel multimodal architecture, specifically
designed to handle B-rep models, and demonstrate how existing CAD tools, in
conjunction with mLLMs, can be used to automatically generate the required
reasoning dataset, without relying on external annotations. We extensively
evaluate B-repLer and demonstrate several text-based B-rep edits of various
complexity, which were not previously possible.

*Yueke Zhang,Yifan Zhang,Kevin Leach,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FormalGrad通过将形式化方法集成到LLM代码生成循环中，显著提升了生成代码的正确性和健壮性，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成方面表现出色，但其生成的解决方案通常缺乏正确性、健壮性和效率的保证，这在需要严格约束的领域中尤为突出。

Method: FormalGrad 提出了一种将形式化方法直接集成到基于LLM的迭代生成循环中的原则性框架，将代码视为可微分变量，并将结构化反馈和形式化约束转化为文本伪梯度。

Result: 在HumanEval、HumanEval+和LiveCodeBench基准测试中，FormalGrad的表现优于强基线模型，在HumanEval上实现了高达27%的绝对改进，在具有挑战性的LiveCodeBench V6上实现了41%的相对改进。

Conclusion: FormalGrad 为高风险应用中的可靠AI辅助软件开发铺平了道路，生成具有形式化保证的代码，确保其健壮性和高效性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in code generation, they often produce solutions that lack guarantees of
correctness, robustness, and efficiency. The limitation is acute in domains
requiring strict constraints. FormalGrad introduces a principled framework that
integrates formal methods directly into an iterative LLM-based generation loop.
It uniquely treats code as a differentiable variable, converting structured
feedback and formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient. This gradient
guides the model to iteratively refine solutions, ensuring they are not only
functional but also robust and formally justified. We evaluate FormalGrad on
the HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. Our implementation
outperforms strong baselines, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 27% on
HumanEval and a 41% relative improvement on the challenging LiveCodeBench V6.
FormalGrad generates formally justified code that is robust and efficient,
paving the way for reliable AI-assisted software development in high-stakes
applications.

*Xiaohan Chen,Zhongying Pan,Quan Feng,Yu Tian,Shuqun Yang,Mengru Wang,Lina Gong,Yuxia Geng,Piji Li,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Saracoder通过分层特征优化和外部感知标识符消歧，解决了现有代码补全方法的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本相似度的检索增强生成方法存在语义误导、冗余和同质化问题，且无法解决外部符号歧义。

Method: 引入Saracoder框架，其核心模块包括分层特征优化和外部感知标识符消歧器，通过深度语义关系提取、去重、图结构相似性评估及结果重排序优化检索结果。

Result: 在CrossCodeEval和RepoEval-Updated基准测试中，Saracoder显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Saracoder通过系统化多维度优化检索结果，为构建更准确、更健壮的仓库级代码补全系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出“下一个编辑预测”任务，通过构建数据集和评估基准，展示了如何预测开发者的下一步编辑，为主动协作的新交互范式奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码补全和基于聊天的编辑方式存在局限性，无法主动预测开发者的一系列相关编辑，导致用户体验不佳。为了填补这一空白，研究者提出了“下一个编辑预测”任务。

Method: 研究者构建了一个高质量的监督微调数据集和评估基准，并对一系列模型进行了监督微调，同时进行了全面评估。

Result: 研究通过监督微调模型和基线模型的全面评估，得出了多项新发现。

Conclusion: 该研究为一种新的交互范式奠定了基础，该范式通过预测开发者的下一步行动来主动协作，而不仅仅是对显式指令做出反应。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了PTLM在GitHub和Hugging Face平台间的提交活动协调，揭示了八种同步模式，指出部分同步模式导致的结构性脱节问题，强调了改进监督和可追溯性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTLM的上游（如GitHub）和下游（如Hugging Face）平台之间的开发协调存在挑战，如发布时间不一致、版本管理不统一和PTLM变体重用有限。

Method: 我们进行了混合方法研究，分析了325个PTLM家族（904个HF变体）的提交活动协调情况，并考察了这些活动的三个维度：延迟、同步类型和强度。

Result: 研究发现，GH贡献者主要进行模型版本指定、代码质量改进、性能优化和依赖管理等更改，而HF贡献者则专注于模型描述改进、数据集处理和模型推理设置。此外，研究揭示了八种不同的同步模式，其中部分同步模式（如分散同步和稀疏同步）揭示了当前跨平台发布实践中的结构性脱节。

Conclusion: 识别这些同步模式对于改进PTLM发布工作流程的监督和可追溯性至关重要。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PTLMs) have advanced natural language processing
(NLP), enabling progress in tasks like text generation and translation. Like
software package management, PTLMs are trained using code and environment
scripts in upstream repositories (e.g., GitHub, GH) and distributed as variants
via downstream platforms like Hugging Face (HF). Coordinating development
between GH and HF poses challenges such as misaligned release timelines,
inconsistent versioning, and limited reuse of PTLM variants. We conducted a
mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit
activities are coordinated. Our analysis reveals that GH contributors typically
make changes related to specifying the version of the model, improving code
quality, performance optimization, and dependency management within the
training scripts, while HF contributors make changes related to improving model
descriptions, data set handling, and setup required for model inference.
Furthermore, to understand the synchronization aspects of commit activities
between GH and HF, we examined three dimensions of these activities -- lag
(delay), type of synchronization, and intensity -- which together yielded eight
distinct synchronization patterns. The prevalence of partially synchronized
patterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals
structural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices. These
patterns often result in isolated changes -- where improvements or fixes made
on one platform are never replicated on the other -- and in some cases,
indicate an abandonment of one repository in favor of the other. Such
fragmentation risks exposing end users to incomplete, outdated, or behaviorally
inconsistent models. Hence, recognizing these synchronization patterns is
critical for improving oversight and traceability in PTLM release workflows.

*Likai Ye,Mengliang Li,Dehai Zhao,Jiamou Sun,Xiaoxue Ren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Solidity版本更新导致大量编译错误，研究提出SMCFIXER框架，结合专家知识和LLM修复机制，显著提升错误解决准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solidity语言的频繁版本更新带来了编译错误、代码迁移和维护的挑战，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 研究首先进行了Solidity版本演化的实证分析，随后系统评估了LLMs在解决编译错误中的表现，并最终提出了SMCFIXER框架，该框架包含上下文感知代码切片、专家知识检索和迭代补丁生成三个核心阶段。

Result: 实证研究显示81.68%的合约在不同版本编译时出现错误，其中86.92%为编译错误；SMCFIXER框架比基准GPT-4o提升了24.24%的准确率。

Conclusion: SMCFIXER框架通过结合专家知识检索和LLM修复机制，显著提升了Solidity版本迁移中的编译错误解决能力，实现了96.97%的准确率。

Abstract: Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly
evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and
developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant
challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and
maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the
challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined
contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92%
of compilation errors.
  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large
language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version
migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek)
and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these
models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes
significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt
engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific
adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.
  Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that
systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair
mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture
comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts
relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official
documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.
Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our
approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on
real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.

TL;DR: EvoScat 是一个通过交互式密度散点图可视化大型软件演化历史数据的工具，支持灵活配置和百万级事件分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期运行的软件项目包含大量随时间演化的工件，传统方法难以有效可视化和分析这些大规模历史数据集。

Method: EvoScat 使用交互式密度散点图，支持灵活的时间轴缩放、对齐、排序和交互式颜色映射，以分析从数万个软件项目中提取的数百万个事件。

Result: EvoScat 能够生成可扩展的可视化，支持研究人员探索和比较软件工件的演化历史，包括变化速度、指标趋势等。

Conclusion: EvoScat 提供了一种有效的方法，通过交互式密度散点图来可视化和分析大型历史数据集，帮助研究人员探索和比较软件项目的演化过程。

Abstract: Long lived software projects encompass a large number of artifacts, which
undergo many revisions throughout their history. Empirical software engineering
researchers studying software evolution gather and collect datasets with
millions of events, representing changes introduced to specific artifacts. In
this paper, we propose EvoScat, a tool that attempts addressing temporal
scalability through the usage of interactive density scatterplot to provide a
global overview of large historical datasets mined from open source
repositories in a single visualization. EvoScat intents to provide researchers
with a mean to produce scalable visualizations that can help them explore and
characterize evolution datasets, as well as comparing the histories of
individual artifacts, both in terms of 1) observing how rapidly different
artifacts age over multiple-year-long time spans 2) how often metrics
associated with each artifacts tend towards an improvement or worsening. The
paper shows how the tool can be tailored to specific analysis needs (pace of
change comparison, clone detection, freshness assessment) thanks to its support
for flexible configuration of history scaling and alignment along the time
axis, artifacts sorting and interactive color mapping, enabling the analysis of
millions of events obtained by mining the histories of tens of thousands of
software artifacts. We include in this paper a gallery showcasing datasets
gathering specific artifacts (OpenAPI descriptions, GitHub workflow
definitions) across multiple repositories, as well as diving into the history
of specific popular open source projects.
