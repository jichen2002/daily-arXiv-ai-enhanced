### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-CR 是一种新型轻量级目标检测模型，通过 CAFM 和 RCM 模块提升疲劳检测性能，实验结果表明其在精确度和召回率上优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶疲劳检测对智能交通系统至关重要，但现有方法存在侵入性、硬件依赖性或鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: YOLO11-CR 是一种轻量级高效的目标检测模型，引入了两个关键模块：卷积与注意力融合模块（CAFM）和矩形校准模块（RCM）。

Result: 在 DSM 数据集上，YOLO11-CR 的精确度为 87.17%，召回率为 83.86%，mAP@50 为 88.09%，mAP@50-95 为 55.93%，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR 提供了一种实用且高性能的车内疲劳监测解决方案，具有在实际环境中部署和未来增强的潜力，包括时间建模、多模态数据集成和嵌入式优化。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage-R1通过两阶段训练和自适应推理策略，显著提升在野AI生成图像检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测器在实验室环境下有效，但在复杂真实场景中泛化能力不足，亟需解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出Mirage-R1，一个两阶段训练的视觉语言模型，包括监督微调冷启动和强化学习阶段，并采用推理时自适应思维策略。

Result: Mirage-R1在Mirage和公共基准上分别领先现有最佳检测器5%和10%。

Conclusion: Mirage-R1通过结合启发式到分析推理的视觉语言模型，显著提高了在野AI生成图像检测的性能，平衡了推理速度与准确性。

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1通过结合推理与专家模型调用，提升了OCR性能并减少幻觉，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在OCR任务中表现出色，但仍存在幻觉问题，且性能不及针对特定任务训练的专家模型。

Method: 提出了DianJin-OCR-R1框架，通过训练推理与工具交替的视觉语言模型（VLMs），先利用自身OCR能力识别内容，再调用其他专家模型获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并优化推理过程。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench上的实验表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型优于非推理版本及专家OCR模型。

Conclusion: DianJin-OCR-R1通过结合推理与工具调用，显著提升了OCR任务的性能，并有效减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CNN的乌尔都语OCR系统，通过组件分类和两级层次神经网络处理字符排列，实现了99%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语因其复杂的几何和形态结构难以分类，且基于分割的识别方法由于上下文敏感性导致高错误率，因此需要一种更高效的识别方法。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络（CNN）进行自动特征学习，通过连接组件技术处理乌尔都语文本数据集，生成仅包含连字的图像。实施了两级层次神经网络来处理字符排列的三个级别和组件分类。

Result: 模型在组件分类上成功达到了99%的准确率。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的组件分类方法在乌尔都语光学字符识别系统中取得了99%的组件分类准确率，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE框架通过课程学习和序数结构改进MES分类，实验显示其在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内镜评分（MES）分类因观察者间变异性和序数性质而具有挑战性，标准模型常忽略这些因素。

Method: 提出CLoE，一个结合课程学习和序数结构的框架，利用图像质量作为注释置信度的代理，并结合ResizeMix增强以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE显著优于强监督和自监督基线，如ConvNeXt-Tiny在LIMUC上达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK。

Conclusion: CLoE框架通过结合课程学习和序数结构，显著提高了在标签不确定性下的序数分类性能，展示了难度感知训练策略的潜力。

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter 是一种基于扩散模型的步态序列合成框架，可生成高质量、可控的步态数据，提升识别性能并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别缺乏大规模标记数据集，且收集多样化步态样本时难以保护隐私。GaitCrafter 旨在解决这些问题。

Method: GaitCrafter 训练了一个视频扩散模型，专门用于生成步态轮廓数据，能够生成时间一致且保留身份的步态序列。生成过程可控制，允许根据服装、携带物品和视角等协变量进行条件生成。

Result: 实验表明，将 GaitCrafter 生成的合成样本纳入步态识别流程可提升性能，尤其是在挑战性条件下。此外，通过插值身份嵌入生成的新身份具有独特且一致的步态模式，有助于模型训练并保护真实受试者的隐私。

Conclusion: GaitCrafter 提出了一种基于扩散模型的高质量、可控且注重隐私的步态数据生成方法，显著提升了步态识别的性能。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [7] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive 是一种无需重新训练的视觉令牌修剪框架，显著提升多视角视觉语言模型的计算效率，性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中因处理高分辨率多视角图像而产生大量计算开销，导致推理延迟和内存消耗增加。

Method: Prune2Drive 引入了两种核心创新：多样性感知令牌选择机制和视图自适应修剪控制器，无需模型重新训练或访问注意力图。

Result: 在保留仅10%的视觉令牌时，Prune2Drive 在预填充阶段实现了6.40倍的加速，仅消耗原始FLOPs的13.4%，性能下降仅为3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive 是一种即插即用的视觉令牌修剪框架，有效解决了多视角视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的计算开销问题，显著提升了速度和内存效率，同时保持了任务性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个多阶段元攻击框架，通过动态组合Lp约束攻击方法生成感知对齐的对抗样本，显著提升了攻击效果和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且缺乏对感知效能的深入研究。本文旨在探索如何利用Lp约束攻击的见解提升感知效能。

Method: DAASH是一个完全可微的元攻击框架，通过多阶段策略性组合现有的Lp约束攻击方法，使用新颖的元损失函数动态调制各基本攻击的贡献。

Result: DAASH在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于现有感知攻击方法（如AdvAD），攻击成功率和视觉质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DAASH框架通过动态调制基本攻击方法的贡献，显著提升了对抗样本的视觉质量和攻击成功率，且能很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，为评估模型鲁棒性提供了实用且强大的基线。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

### [10] [Applications of Small Language Models in Medical Imaging Classification with a Focus on Prompt Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13378)
*Yiting Wang,Ziwei Wang,Jiachen Zhong,Di Zhu,Weiyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过精心设计的提示策略，小型语言模型（SLMs）在医疗影像分类任务中可以达到与大型语言模型（LLMs）相媲美的准确性，且无需用户具备深厚的AI专业知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理和多模态理解方面表现出色，但其高计算成本、有限的可访问性和数据隐私问题限制了其在资源受限的医疗环境中的应用。

Method: 研究比较了不同的小型语言模型（SLMs）和提示设计，使用NIH胸部X光数据集，评估了三种提示策略（基线指令、增量总结提示和基于校正的反思提示）在胸部X光位置分类任务（AP vs. PA）中的表现。

Result: 结果显示，某些SLMs在精心设计的提示下达到了与LLMs相当的准确性，表明提示工程可以显著提升SLMs在医疗应用中的性能。

Conclusion: 提示工程可以大幅提升SLMs在医疗应用中的表现，无需用户具备深厚的AI专业知识，为资源受限的医疗环境提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文发现VQA基准测试中的Easy-Options Bias问题，提出GroundAttack工具包生成视觉合理的负选项，创建EOB-free数据集，更真实评估VLMs能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现多个VQA基准测试中存在Easy-Options Bias（EOB），即视觉语言模型（VLMs）仅通过视觉和选项输入即可选择正确答案，无需问题输入。这种偏差导致评估不准确。

Method: 通过接地实验，作者发现EOB源于视觉相关性不平衡：正确答案在特征空间中与视觉内容更一致。为解决这一问题，作者开发了GroundAttack工具包，自动生成视觉上合理的负选项。

Result: 在EOB-free标注上，当前VLMs在（V+O）设置下接近随机准确率，在（V+Q+O）设置下准确率下降至非饱和水平，提供了对VLMs问答能力的更真实评估。

Conclusion: 论文提出了GroundAttack工具包，用于生成视觉上合理的负选项，从而消除Easy-Options Bias（EOB），并在NExT-QA和MMStar数据集上创建了新的EOB-free标注。这些标注更真实地评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的问答能力。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Motivation: 传统方法在复杂动态的真实环境中难以实现可扩展性和泛化性，因此需要一种能够自动生成高质量交通场景注释和风险评估的框架。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的结构化提示和知识蒸馏框架，利用GPT-4o和o3-mini两个大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成高质量交通场景注释和上下文风险评估，再通过监督微调训练出紧凑的3B规模学生模型VISTA。

Result: VISTA在低分辨率交通视频理解及语义忠实、风险感知的标题生成任务中表现优异，尽管参数大幅减少，但在多个标题生成指标（BLEU-4、METEOR、ROUGE-L、CIDEr）上均取得了与教师模型相当的强性能。

Conclusion: 通过知识蒸馏和结构化多智能体监督，轻量级视觉语言模型（VISTA）能够捕捉复杂推理能力，并在边缘设备上高效部署，实现实时风险监控。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: EDTalk++ 提出了一种新颖的全解耦框架，用于可控的说话头部生成，通过四个轻量级模块成功分解了面部动态，并在实验中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve kidney stone classification accuracy under variable imaging conditions by leveraging ViTs' ability to capture long-range dependencies, which CNNs struggle with.

Method: Comparative analysis between Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models (ResNet50) on two ex vivo datasets (CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images).

Result: ViT-base model consistently outperformed ResNet50, achieving 95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score in complex conditions, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.

Conclusion: ViT-based architectures outperform conventional CNNs in kidney stone classification, offering a scalable and superior alternative for image analysis.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Motivation: 解决多图像编码中因独立神经网络导致的计算和存储效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出MINR方法，共享中间层并设计输入特定的输入输出层和独特的投影层。

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省了60%的参数且性能相当，可扩展到处理100张图像，平均PSNR为34 dB。

Conclusion: MINR通过共享中间层和设计独特的投影层，显著提高了多图像编码的效率和可扩展性，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INRs依赖全精度数值表示，硬件开销大；此前量化方法仅针对权重，硬件节省有限。

Method: 利用哈达玛变换将权重和激活的多样化分布标准化为统一的钟形形式，再应用标准量化器。

Result: DHQ在FPGA实现中，延迟降低32.7%，能耗减少40.1%，资源利用率最高降低98.3%。

Conclusion: DHQ是一种新颖的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，显著提升了隐式神经表示（INRs）的硬件效率，在图像重建任务中表现优于现有量化方法。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的鲁棒损失函数，显著提高了隐式神经表示（INRs）在权重扰动下的重建质量，实验证明其PSNR值在噪声条件下最高可提升7.5 dB。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过结合2D和3D CNN的多任务学习及分层注意力机制，显著提升了微表情识别的性能，并在多个数据集上取得了优异的成绩。

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集主要针对小型家用物体，限制了其在移动机器人领域的适用性。移动机器人面临长距离感知、大物体交互和复杂遮挡等挑战，需要专门的数据集支持。

Method: 研究者引入了MR6D数据集，包含92个真实场景和16种独特物体，覆盖静态和动态交互，特别关注移动机器人面临的挑战。

Result: 实验表明，当前6D姿态估计方法在移动机器人场景中表现不佳，2D分割成为另一大挑战。MR6D为开发适用于移动机器人的姿态估计方法奠定了基础。

Conclusion: MR6D数据集为移动机器人6D姿态估计提供了专门的基础，填补了现有数据集在工业环境中的空白，并揭示了当前方法在此类场景中的不足。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

*Tianyi Xu,Fan Zhang,Boxin Shi,Tianfan Xue,Yujin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptiveAE利用强化学习优化快门速度和ISO选择，提升动态场景下的HDR重建质量，实验验证其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了快门速度与ISO之间的复杂交互及动态场景中的运动模糊效应，导致HDR重建质量受限。

Method: 提出了一种基于强化学习的方法AdaptiveAE，结合图像合成管道，融入运动模糊和噪声模拟，利用语义信息和曝光直方图进行训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，AdaptiveAE能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应选择最优的ISO和快门速度序列，性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE通过强化学习优化快门速度和ISO的选择，在动态环境中实现了高质量的HDR重建，实验证明其性能达到业界领先水平。

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

*Seungheon Baek,Jinhyuk Yun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过迁移单打训练模型至双打，结合ViT-Pose和ST-GCN框架，成功实现了双打羽毛球的击球识别，为双打数据分析奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双打比赛在国际赛事中比单打更普遍，但由于数据获取和多人物追踪的挑战，先前研究主要集中在单打。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用ViT-Pose从ShuttleSet单打数据集中提取关键点，通过基于ST-GCN的对比学习框架进行嵌入。为提升跟踪稳定性，采用自定义多目标跟踪算法解决快速和重叠球员运动的ID切换问题。最后，基于Transformer的分类器根据学习到的嵌入确定击球发生。

Conclusion: 本研究通过将单打训练模型迁移至双打分析，成功扩展了基于姿势的击球识别能力，为双打羽毛球的数据分析奠定了基础，并促进了这一主流但研究不足的运动形式的理解。

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

*Yiang Shi,Xiaoyang Guo,Wei Yin,Mingkai Jia,Qian Zhang,Xiaolin Hu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGQ是一种新型图像标记化框架，通过整合2D高斯分布增强结构建模，显著提升重建质量，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量化标记化方法（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征（如纹理和颜色），而忽略了几何结构。VGQ旨在解决这一局限性，通过更丰富的视觉信息编码提升标记化效果。

Method: 提出了一种名为Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)的新框架，通过将2D高斯分布整合到传统的视觉码书量化框架中，直接建模结构相关参数（如位置、旋转和尺度），以增强对几何和空间结构的捕捉。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ取得了rFID分数1.00的强重建质量。通过增加2D高斯分布的密度，VGQ进一步将rFID提升至0.556，PSNR达到24.93，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ作为一种新型的图像标记化框架，通过整合2D高斯分布显著提升了结构建模能力，在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中取得了优异的重建质量，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

TL;DR: 利用基础模型的几何特征分布校准，解决数据异构和样本不平衡问题，在联邦学习和长尾识别中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中存在观测训练样本与真实分布之间的差距（如采样偏差、噪声等），基础模型时代下，如何利用现成视觉基础模型的几何形状特征分布来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用现成的视觉基础模型（如CLIP、DINOv2）进行特征提取，并通过几何形状知识校准分布。在联邦学习中，设计了一种在隐私约束下获取全局几何形状的技术；在长尾识别中，利用样本丰富类别的几何知识恢复样本稀缺尾类的真实分布。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在联邦学习和长尾识别等挑战性场景中表现优异，有效克服信息不足问题。

Conclusion: 几何知识引导的分布校准框架有效克服了数据异构性和样本不平衡引起的信息不足，显著提升了基准测试中的性能。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3DGS方法在捕捉细粒度表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面的不足，特别是在高变形区域。

Method: 提出了一种基于3D高斯抛射的EAvatar框架，结合稀疏表情控制机制和高质量3D先验，优化了面部几何和纹理连续性。

Result: 实验结果表明，EAvatar在表情可控性和细节保真度上优于现有方法，实现了更准确和视觉连贯的头部重建。

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过稀疏表情控制机制和高质量3D先验，显著提升了头部重建的表情准确性和细节保真度，为AR/VR等领域提供了更高质量的头部重建方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR通过频率和局部感知的隐式神经表示，解决了现有INR的频率和空间局限性，提升了2D和3D任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR缺乏频率选择性、空间定位和稀疏表示，导致过度依赖冗余信号成分和频谱偏差，难以捕捉高频细节。

Method: 提出了FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：RC-GAUSS激活函数（用于频率选择和空间定位）和WEGE编码（利用DWT计算能量分数并显式引导频率信息）。

Result: FLAIR在2D图像表示与修复以及3D重建任务中一致优于现有INR方法。

Conclusion: FLAIR通过引入RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码方法，显著提升了INR在频率选择性和空间定位方面的表现，在2D图像表示与修复以及3D重建任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 当前基于硬件的眼动追踪系统成本高、校准复杂且硬件兼容性受限，限制了注视点渲染技术的广泛应用。

Method: 结合了Spherical Vision Transformer处理360度VR场景和基于LSTM的时间编码器捕捉注视序列模式，通过多模态融合网络整合空间场景特征与时间注视动态，预测未来注视点及其置信度。

Result: 在综合VR数据集上的实验评估显示，GazeProphet的中位角度误差为3.83度，比传统基于显著性的基线方法提升了24%，并在不同空间区域和场景类型中保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: GazeProphet通过纯软件方法实现了VR环境中的注视点预测，无需额外硬件支持，显著提升了VR应用的性能，使更多平台和应用能够受益于这种性能提升。

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Motivation: 尽管GFVC在率失真性能上表现优越，但其大模型参数和高计算成本阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 通过架构重设计和操作优化（包括使用更高效的层和两阶段自适应通道剪枝策略）来降低复杂度。

Conclusion: 所提出的轻量级双模式优化方法显著减少了GFVC的模型参数和计算成本，同时保持了重建质量，有望在资源受限的环境中实现高效部署。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Motivation: 当前SNN性能落后于CNN的主要原因是脉冲数据的信息容量有限，且现有方法（如使用静态图像训练）偏离了神经形态计算的初衷。

Method: 提出了一种基于生物神经元工作原理的Neuron-like Encoding方法，并结合人工光感受器层生成包含颜色和亮度信息的视觉脉冲信号。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的Neuron-like Encoding方法结合人工光感受器层，有效提升了脉冲信号的信息量和SNN性能，同时遵循神经形态计算原则，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在少样本异常分割（FSAS）中的跨类别泛化能力依赖于已知异常样本的先验知识，限制了其应用范围。

Method: DictAS框架包含字典构建、字典查找和查询判别正则化三个主要组件，结合对比查询约束和文本对齐约束。

Result: 在七个公开工业和医学数据集上的实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的FSAS方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督学习和字典查找机制，显著提升了在未见类别上的异常检测性能，无需目标数据重新训练。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Motivation: SMPLify 的高计算成本限制了其实际应用。受其他领域用神经网络替代迭代优化的启发，作者希望通过类似方法提升效率。

Method: 提出了 Learnable SMPLify，一种神经框架，通过数据驱动的神经网络替代迭代优化。为了解决数据构建和泛化性挑战，设计了时序采样策略、人-centric 归一化方案和残差学习。

Result: Learnable SMPLify 实现了近 200 倍的运行速度提升，在 3DPW 和 RICH 上表现出良好的泛化性，并可作为插件工具用于 LucidAction。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify 提出了一种神经框架，通过单次回归模型替代了 SMPLify 中的迭代优化过程，显著提升了运行效率，同时保持了准确性，并在泛化性和实用性上表现出色。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at
https://github.com/Charrrrrlie/Learnable-SMPLify.

Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

Conclusion: 提出的Temporal-Conditional RVOS模型通过创新整合现有分割方法、简化模型设计并引入TCMR模块，显著提升了边界分割能力，在四个公共RVOS基准测试中均达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境下的性能下降，且相关数据稀缺。获取和标注恶劣天气数据成本高昂，因此需要一种经济高效的数据生成方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的域适应（DA）管道，结合仿真、GAN和扩散-GAN混合方法，从清晰天气图像生成雾、雨、雪和夜间图像。通过优化训练流程和引入自适应混合技术，减少生成图像中的伪影。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上的评估显示，语义分割整体性能提升1.85%，夜间条件下提升4.62%。

Conclusion: 通过混合扩散-GAN方法生成的合成数据有效提升了自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境下的感知性能，尤其在夜间条件下表现显著。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 提高 SSM 在计算机视觉中的计算效率，同时保持其独特的序列建模能力。

Method: 利用状态转移参数 $\mathbf{\Delta}$ 作为信息量度量，并引入策略性令牌排列以保留序列信息流。

Result: MaMe 在令牌减少的情况下实现了优越的效率-性能平衡，并在图像分类、视频和音频领域表现出色。

Conclusion: MaMe 是一种专为基于 SSM 的视觉模型设计的令牌合并策略，通过量化令牌重要性和保留序列特性，显著提升了计算效率与性能的平衡，并在多领域展现了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖耦合编码器，导致语义和几何先验之间存在冲突，限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出了FoundationSSC框架，包括双解耦设计（源级别和路径级别）和轴感知融合模块（AAF），用于生成互补的3D特征。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上，mIoU提升0.23，IoU提升2.03；在SSCBench-KITTI-360上，mIoU达21.78，IoU达48.61，均为最优。

Conclusion: FoundationSSC通过双解耦设计和创新的轴感知融合模块，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能，在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360数据集上均取得了最佳结果。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集通过其规模、质量和多样性显著提升了音频驱动说话头合成的泛化能力，并揭示了传统聚合指标未能捕捉的性能差异。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Motivation: 当前基于RGB-D的类别级物体姿态估计方法在缺乏深度信息的场景中表现不佳，因此提出仅依赖RGB图像的新方法。

Method: 设计了一个基于transformer的神经网络，用于预测和融合目标物体的几何特征，并引入几何特征引导算法以确保预测特征的准确性，最后使用RANSAC-PnP算法计算物体姿态。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法高效且精度优于现有RGB方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的仅依赖RGB图像的类别级物体姿态估计方法，不仅高效且精度优于现有RGB方法，为相关领域提供了新的视角。

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 发现分类器无关引导（CFG）在条件生成中存在‘训练-推理差距’，导致生成样本质量对引导权重高度敏感。

Method: 提出了DiffIER，一种基于优化的方法，通过在每个推理步骤中迭代最小化误差来减少累积误差。

Result: DiffIER在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等任务中表现一致优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DiffIER通过迭代误差最小化有效减少了推理阶段的累积误差，显著提升了生成质量，并在多个条件生成任务中优于基线方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: DeH4R通过结合图生成的高效性和图生长的动态性，实现了在保持快速推理速度的同时，提升了拓扑保真度和空间一致性，并在CityScale和SpaceNet基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%

materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

### [55] [Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models through Intermediate Projector Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739)
*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPGA通过攻击投影模块中间阶段（Q-Former），实现了更精细的对抗攻击，提升了效果和迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对抗攻击方法在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中仅扰动图像以最大化全局相似性，忽略了投影模块的关键作用，限制了攻击的精细度和效果。

Method: 提出了Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA)方法，利用Q-Former将全局图像嵌入转换为细粒度视觉特征，并通过Residual Query Alignment (RQA)保留无关视觉内容。

Result: IPGA在全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法，并能成功迁移到多个商业VLMs。

Conclusion: IPGA通过攻击投影模块的中间阶段（如Q-Former），实现了对视觉语言模型更精细的对抗攻击，显著提升了攻击效果和跨模型迁移性。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的通用解码策略，通过掩码和对比精炼有效解决LVLMs在多图像任务中的信息泄漏问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多图像输入时性能显著下降，原因是不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中纠缠（跨图像信息泄漏）。

Method: FOCUS是一种训练无关且架构无关的解码策略，通过顺序掩码所有图像（除一张外）并引入随机噪声，引导模型专注于单张干净图像。重复此过程并聚合结果，最后通过对比精炼抑制信息泄漏。

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM家族中一致提升了性能。

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种无需额外训练或架构修改的通用解决方案，显著提升了LVLMs在多图像任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

TL;DR: 本文提出多相机非刚性3D形状配准方法，通过三种新方法实现高精度重建，扩展了SfT的应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SfT研究多基于单图像，多相机联合信息为3D形状配准（如医学影像和手持相机）提供了新方向。

Method: 提出了三种方法：第一种基于已知3D点的方向向量；第二种基于未知3D点但已知局部参考系方向；第三种结合轮廓信息。所有方法均通过凸编程或迭代优化实现。

Result: 实验证明，所提方法在合成和真实数据上均实现了高精度重建。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的多相机非刚性3D形状配准方法，扩展了Shape-from-Template（SfT）的应用范围，并通过多种方法实现了高精度的形状重建。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw 通过双层优化框架（LLMs 驱动的解耦策略和视觉评估机制）解决了现有方法在推断物体内在动力学时的泛化和可解释性问题，实验证明其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推断物体内在动力学时面临两个主要挑战：依赖手动定义的本构先验难以泛化到复杂场景，或使用神经网络导致可解释性差和泛化能力弱。

Method: VisionLaw 是一个双层优化框架，上层采用大语言模型驱动的解耦本构演化策略，下层引入视觉引导的本构评估机制。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw 能够有效推断出可解释的内在动力学，并显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisionLaw 能够有效地从视觉观察中推断出可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Motivation: 提升乳腺癌超声分割的性能和可解释性，结合临床放射学报告以增强模型的透明度和可信度。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的双分支视觉编码器（ViT和Swin Transformer）结合BioClinicalBERT编码的临床文本，通过跨模态注意力融合视觉和文本特征，实现病灶分割、不确定性图和诊断理由的一体化生成。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上，Med-CTX的Dice分数达到99%，IoU为95%，优于现有基线模型（U-Net、ViT和Swin）。临床文本对分割精度和解释质量具有关键作用，消融实验显示其缺失会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: Med-CTX通过结合视觉和临床文本的多模态方法，显著提升了乳腺癌超声分割的性能和可解释性，为可信赖的医疗AI架构设立了新标准。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCA是一种针对SNN的低延迟对抗攻击框架，通过TLBP和A-MPR组件显著减少攻击时间，适用于实时场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的对抗攻击方法在SNN中存在多时间步处理导致的高延迟问题，无法满足实时应用需求。TCA旨在通过利用SNN特性解决这一问题。

Method: TCA框架包含两个关键组件：基于SNN行为的TLBP（时间步级反向传播）和A-MPR（对抗性膜电位重用）。TLBP通过逐时间步评估实现早期停止，A-MPR通过预计算和重用初始时间步的膜电位减少计算开销。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型及CIFAR-10/100、CIFAR10-DVS数据集上的实验表明，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别将攻击延迟降低56.6%和57.1%，同时保持可比的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过引入TLBP和A-MPR两大组件，显著降低了攻击延迟，并保持了较高的攻击成功率，为SNN的实时对抗攻击提供了可行方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候韧性、生态稳定和城市宜居性至关重要，但大多数城市缺乏对其树冠的详细了解。传统的实地调查成本高且耗时，而监督AI方法需要标签数据且难以跨区域推广。

Method: 论文介绍了一种结合街景图像视觉嵌入和空间种植模式的无监督聚类框架，无需标签数据即可估算生物多样性。

Result: 该方法在北美八个城市中应用，能够高保真地恢复属级多样性模式，与真实数据的Wasserstein距离较低，并保留了空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种无监督聚类框架，能够高效且低成本地估算城市树木生物多样性，为缺乏详细清单的城市提供了可行的解决方案，并支持绿色资源的公平分配和城市生态系统的适应性管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Result: 在流行的跨域目标检测基准测试中，SA3取得了优于现有方法的结果。

Conclusion: SA3方法在跨域目标检测中表现出色，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for identifying stone deterioration patterns are accurate but time-consuming and resource-intensive. The Id-Pattern system aims to address these limitations by leveraging AI.

Method: The system employs a multi-agent AI approach, simulating collaboration between five specialized agents (lithologist, pathologist, environmental expert, conservator-restorer, and diagnostic coordinator) to automate diagnosis from visual evidence.

Result: Initial evaluation on 28 challenging images showed substantial improvements across all metrics compared to the foundational model.

Conclusion: The Id-Pattern system demonstrates significant improvements in identifying stone deterioration patterns compared to traditional methods, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative.

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多依赖简化的合成基准，掩盖了真实世界中的性能表现。为解决这一问题，作者提出了更贴近现实的评估基准。

Method: 引入了两个现实增量目标检测基准（RICO）：领域RICO（D-RICO）和扩展类RICO（EC-RICO），基于14个多样化数据集构建，涵盖真实和合成领域、不同条件（如天气、时间）、相机传感器、视角和标注策略。

Result: 实验表明，所有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保留方面均表现不佳，而重放少量旧数据方法已优于现有方法。独立训练数据仍是最佳选择。

Conclusion: 论文指出，当前增量学习方法在适应性和知识保留方面表现不佳，而简单的重放少量旧数据方法已优于现有方法。然而，独立训练数据仍是最佳选择。作者将此归因于蒸馏中的弱教师、单一模型难以处理多样化任务以及不足的可塑性。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 探讨MLLMs在图像旋转识别任务中的表现，以评估其视觉推理和空间关系理解能力。

Method: 通过引入RotBench基准测试，评估了多种MLLMs在识别0°、90°、180°和270°旋转图像时的表现。采用了辅助信息（如标题、深度图）和思维链提示等方法。

Result: 多数MLLMs能可靠识别0°图像，部分能识别180°图像，但无法区分90°和270°旋转。辅助信息和思维链提示效果有限，微调仅对180°识别有改进。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图像旋转识别任务中的局限性，表明其空间推理能力与人类感知存在显著差距。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医学影像中依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义特征的问题，提升模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出LCRReg正则化方法，利用辅助数据集合成高质量、解耦的概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的LCRs，并通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念子空间中激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证了LCRReg的有效性，显著提高了对虚假相关性的鲁棒性，并在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中提升了OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg是一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，通过利用潜在概念表示（LCRs）引导模型学习语义基础表示，显著提高了模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性，尤其在医学影像任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

Motivation: 南亚烟雾事件对印度-恒河平原造成严重影响，但实时预测系统尚未在区域范围内建立。

Method: 使用Sentinel-5P气溶胶数据（2019-2023）和ConvLSTM神经网络模型，以UV气溶胶指数（340-380 nm）为预测因子。

Result: 模型能以五天间隔预测气溶胶指数，均方误差约为0.0018，损失约为0.3995，结构相似性指数约为0.74。

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: SCRNet通过结合卷积和交叉注意力机制，成功解决了医学超声图像分割中长距离依赖和局部上下文信息的问题，并在实验中表现出色，达到了当前最先进的性能。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Conclusion: DIME-Net展示了在多样化和复杂光照条件下的泛化能力及实际多媒体应用潜力。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Conclusion: ViT-FIQA通过引入可学习的质量标记，结合ViT架构，显著提升了人脸图像质量评估的性能，为未来FIQA研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial

this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view

high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新数据集Dense-WebVid-CoVR和模型，通过交叉注意力融合视觉与文本信息，显著提升了组合视频检索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准检索框架难以处理细粒度组合查询和时间理解的复杂性，限制了其在细粒度设置中的检索能力。

Method: 开发了一个新模型，通过基于接地文本编码器的交叉注意力（CA）融合整合视觉和文本信息，实现密集查询修改与目标视频的精确对齐。

Result: 提出的模型在所有指标上均优于现有方法，实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的模型在视觉+文本设置下实现了71.3%的Recall@1，显著优于现有方法3.4%，验证了其利用详细视频描述和密集修改文本的有效性。

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Abstract: LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from
casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To
address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves
state-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose
accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches. Project

TL;DR: Chain-of-Agents（CoA）是一种新的LLM推理范式，通过动态激活工具和角色扮演智能体模拟多智能体协作，结合监督微调和强化学习，提升了复杂问题解决的端到端性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统依赖手动提示/工作流工程，计算效率低且无法从数据为中心的学习中受益。

Method: 提出了一种多智能体蒸馏框架，将最先进的多智能体系统提炼为CoA轨迹，用于监督微调，并通过可验证的智能体任务进行强化学习。

Result: AFM在网页智能体和代码智能体设置中，在多样化的基准测试中均取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Agent Foundation Models (AFMs)通过Chain-of-Agents（CoA）范式，在复杂问题解决中实现了端到端的性能提升，并在多个基准测试中创下新纪录。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

### [85] [Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management for LLMs -- An Empirical Study of Functional Infinite Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13171)
*Tao An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace通过模拟人类认知机制，显著提升了LLMs的上下文管理能力，实证验证了其在内存重用率和效率上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有技术（如Infini-attention和StreamingLLM）在上下文长度上取得了进展，但它们缺乏元认知意识和主动规划能力，无法实现真正的认知扩展。因此，需要一种更动态、任务驱动的方法来改进LLMs的上下文管理。

Method: 基于认知科学理论（如Baddeley的工作记忆模型、Clark的扩展心智论和Hutchins的分布式认知框架），提出了Cognitive Workspace的三个核心创新：主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲区和任务驱动的上下文优化。

Result: Cognitive Workspace的平均内存重用率达到58.6%（传统RAG为0%），净效率提升17-18%，且统计显著性高（p < 0.001，Cohen's d > 23）。

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace 提出了一种超越传统检索增强生成（RAG）的新范式，通过模拟人类外部记忆使用的认知机制，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLMs）的上下文管理能力。实证验证表明，该方法在内存重用率和效率上具有显著优势，为LLM系统的认知增强提供了首个定量证据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaEval 是一个无需回测的 alpha 挖掘评估框架，通过多维度评估提升效率与全面性，实验证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 alpha 挖掘评估方法（如回测和基于相关性的指标）存在计算量大、忽略关键属性（如时间稳定性、鲁棒性等）以及封闭源代码阻碍可重复性等问题。

Method: 提出了 AlphaEval 框架，通过五个互补维度评估生成的 alpha：预测能力、稳定性、市场扰动鲁棒性、金融逻辑和多样性。

Result: 实验表明，AlphaEval 在评估一致性与综合回测相当的同时，提供了更全面的洞察和更高的效率，并能有效识别优于传统单指标筛选方法的 alpha。

Conclusion: AlphaEval 提供了一个统一的、可并行化的、无需回测的评估框架，用于自动化 alpha 挖掘模型，显著提升了评估效率和全面性。

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决如何将本体和约束拟合到形式为有限关系结构的正负示例中的问题。

Method: 研究使用了描述逻辑$\mathcal{E\\mkern-2mu L}$和$\mathcal{E\\mkern-2mu LI}$以及多种类型的元组生成依赖（TGDs），包括完整、受保护、前沿受保护、前沿一和无限制TGDs，以及包含依赖关系。

Result: 研究精确指出了计算复杂性，设计了算法，并分析了拟合本体和TGDs的大小。

Conclusion: 研究发现，$\mathcal{E\\mkern-2mu L}$、$\mathcal{E\\mkern-2mu LI}$、受保护的TGDs和包含依赖关系存在有限基，而完整的、前沿受保护的和前沿一的TGDs则一般不存在有限基。

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

Motivation: 提升文本到SQL模型在现实应用中的基础能力和泛化能力，特别是在处理WHERE子句的语义解析时。

Method: 整合模型可解释性分析与执行引导策略，结合过滤调整、逻辑关联优化和模型融合，设计了CESQL模型。

Result: CESQL模型在WikiSQL数据集上表现出色，显著提升了预测结果的准确性。

Conclusion: CESQL模型通过结合模型可解释性分析和执行引导策略，显著提升了文本到SQL任务的基础能力和泛化能力，特别是在处理WHERE子句时。该模型不仅减少了对条件列数据的依赖，还避免了手动标注训练数据的影响，为处理复杂查询和现实数据库环境中的不规则数据提供了新的研究视角。

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

TL;DR: 本文识别了搜索型LLM代理评估中的搜索时污染（STC）问题，实验显示代理可直接获取测试数据，导致基准失效。阻塞污染源后准确性下降，建议改进基准设计以应对此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是识别和解决搜索型LLM代理评估中的新污染形式——搜索时污染（STC），这种污染会损害基准的完整性和评估的可信度。

Method: 作者通过分析搜索型LLM代理的日志，识别了STC问题，并在三个常用能力基准（HLE、SimpleQA和GPQA）上进行了实验。实验包括阻塞HuggingFace后的准确性变化以及消融实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，约3%的问题中，搜索型代理直接从HuggingFace获取了带有真实标签的数据集。阻塞HuggingFace后，受污染子集的准确性下降了约15%。消融实验表明，公开可访问的评估数据集可能不是STC的唯一来源。

Conclusion: 本文提出了针对搜索型LLM代理的新污染形式——搜索时污染（STC）的问题，并建议了基准设计和结果报告的最佳实践，以确保对搜索型LLM代理的可信评估。同时，作者公开了实验日志以促进评估结果的审计。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在处理大规模输入时，令牌级计算成本成为瓶颈。现有令牌选择方法多为静态、模态特定或不兼容自回归生成，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 提出QuickMerge框架，包括动态令牌选择（基于注意力范数）、熵预算估计器和轻量级Transformer先验，以保持自回归兼容性。

Result: QuickMerge在多模态领域评估中表现优异，显著减少令牌数量的同时，性能匹配甚至超过学习型令牌器和固定补丁基线。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过动态选择基于注意力范数大小的令牌，结合熵预算估计器和轻量级Transformer先验，实现了高效的下一个令牌预测，显著减少了令牌数量，同时在多模态领域保持了性能优势。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Motivation: 研究战略决策中即时机会与长期目标之间的权衡，特别是在国际象棋中人类与AI的差异。

Method: 通过基于网络的棋子互动指标量化棋盘上的战略张力，并比较人类对局与AI对局的动态。

Result: 最具竞争力的AI玩家比精英人类玩家能更长时间维持更高的战略张力；人类玩家的战略张力随技能水平在1600和2300 Elo时显著增加。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了AI与人类在国际象棋中战略决策的不同模式，AI能更长时间维持高水平的战略张力，这可能对AI在复杂战略环境中的应用有启示。

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Motivation: 尽管科学文献中存在大量材料数据，但这些信息大多以非结构化图表形式存在，阻碍了基于大语言模型（LLM）的AI代理自动化材料设计。

Method: 采用Descriptive Interpretation of Visual Expression (DIVE)多智能体工作流，系统读取和组织科学文献中的图形数据。

Conclusion: DIVE多智能体工作流显著提升了从科学文献中提取数据的准确性和覆盖范围，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式。

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt通过双重提示策略提升LLM自动启发式设计效果，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的自动启发式设计在进化计算框架中表现受限，主要因为静态算子的使用和缺乏知识积累机制。

Method: 引入了HiFo-Prompt框架，采用前瞻性提示（基于种群动态自适应引导搜索）和后顾性提示（从过去成功的启发式中提炼可重用设计原则）的双重策略。

Result: 实证结果表明，HiFo-Prompt在生成启发式质量、收敛速度和查询效率上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt通过前瞻性和后顾性提示策略，显著提升了基于LLM的自动启发式设计的效果，实现了更高质量的启发式生成、更快的收敛速度和更高的查询效率。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOOP is a neuro-symbolic planning framework that enables iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components, achieving high success rates in complex domains and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing flawed plans, while classical planners lack flexibility. Existing neuro-symbolic methods miss the opportunity for iterative collaboration between neural and symbolic components.

Method: LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features, including graph neural networks, multi-agent validation, hierarchical decomposition, and causal memory, to iteratively refine PDDL specifications based on symbolic feedback.

Result: LOOP achieved an 85.8% success rate on standard IPC benchmark domains, outperforming LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%).

Conclusion: LOOP demonstrates that the integration of neural and symbolic components through iterative conversation is key to reliable planning, offering a blueprint for trusted autonomous systems in critical applications.

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPANER是一种模态无关的PEFT框架，通过共享提示机制统一多模态语义空间，提升跨模态泛化能力，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态PEFT方法大多关注任务特定增益，而忽略了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化。

Method: SPANER采用了一种模态无关的PEFT框架，通过共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关的实例在空间上收敛，无论其模态如何。

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展示了竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时在学习到的嵌入空间中保持了高语义一致性。

Conclusion: SPANER通过共享提示机制成功地将多模态输入嵌入到统一的语义空间中，证明了在可扩展的多模态学习中，对齐嵌入结构而不仅仅是调整适配器权重的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

TL;DR: TASER是一个连续学习的代理系统，用于从杂乱的多页金融表格中提取结构化数据，表现优于现有模型，并发布了首个真实金融表格数据集TASERTab。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的金融文档通常包含大量杂乱、多页且碎片化的表格，传统方法难以有效处理。为了解决这一问题，研究团队开发了TASER系统。

Method: TASER系统通过表格检测、分类、提取和推荐四个步骤，利用初始模式进行连续学习，并由推荐代理审核输出、提出模式修订建议并最终决定推荐内容。

Result: TASER在表格检测任务上比现有模型（如Table Transformer）表现提升10.1%。更大的批量大小使可操作的模式建议增加104.3%，提取的资产增加9.8%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基于代理和模式引导的提取系统（如TASER）在理解和处理现实世界中的复杂金融表格方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Motivation: 由于复杂的时间模式、动态的空间结构和多样的输入格式，时空交通预测具有挑战性。尽管基于Transformer的模型提供了强大的全局建模能力，但它们通常在时间编码和时空融合方面表现不佳。

Method: STPFormer集成了四个模块：Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA)用于模式感知的时间编码，Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA)用于序列空间学习，Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM)用于跨域对齐，以及Attention Mixer用于多尺度融合。

Conclusion: STPFormer通过统一的、可解释的表征学习，在时空交通预测中实现了最先进的性能，并通过实验和可视化验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art
performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It
integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world

Motivation: 针对具有最坏性能要求的广泛应用场景，提出一种通用的离散最小-最大违反（DMMV）优化问题。

Method: 定义了DMMV问题并探索其数学性质，开发了GPU加速的启发式方法以加速求解过程。

Result: 在语言模型量化、离散断层扫描和FIR滤波器设计中，启发式方法分别实现了14%的平均改进、16%的重建误差减少和50%的波纹减少。

Conclusion: 研究提出了DMMV作为一种通用的优化问题，并通过GPU加速的启发式方法在多个实际应用中展示了其优越性能，代码将开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型代理在自动化现实任务中显示出巨大潜力，但在安全关键场景中存在严重风险，尤其是在风险意识与安全执行能力之间存在显著差距。

Method: 开发了一个全面的评估框架，从三个递进维度（风险知识、风险识别能力和实际行为）评估代理的安全性，并利用观察到的差距设计了一个风险验证器和抽象器系统。

Result: 评估揭示了两个关键性能差距：代理在风险知识上表现近乎完美（>98%通过率），但在实际场景中识别风险的能力下降（性能下降>23%），且仍经常执行风险行为（<26%通过率）。最终系统将风险行为执行减少了55.3%。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管语言模型代理在风险知识方面表现优异，但在实际执行中识别和避免风险的能力存在显著差距。通过开发独立的风险验证器和抽象器，系统显著减少了风险行为的执行。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,

foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for

respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent

TL;DR: EAG-RL通过专家引导和强化学习提升LLMs在EHR推理中的表现，实验显示其显著提升了推理能力和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医学文本理解上表现出色，但在EHR预测任务中表现不佳，主要因为难以建模时间结构化和高维数据。现有方法依赖混合范式，未能提升LLM的内在推理能力，且继承了DL模型的泛化限制。

Method: 提出了EAG-RL，一个两阶段训练框架：第一阶段通过专家引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量的分步推理轨迹来初始化LLM策略；第二阶段通过强化学习优化策略，使LLM的注意力与专家EHR模型识别的临床显著特征对齐。

Result: 在两个真实世界EHR数据集上的实验表明，EAG-RL平均提升了LLMs内在EHR推理能力14.62%，同时增强了对特征扰动和未见临床领域的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: EAG-RL通过专家注意力引导和强化学习，显著提升了LLMs在电子健康记录（EHR）推理中的内在能力，并增强了其对特征扰动和未见临床领域的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

TL;DR: 论文提出MSRL方法，通过多模态结构化奖励系统突破SFT性能瓶颈，在图表到代码生成任务中实现显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）在视觉语言模型中表现优异，但在需要深入理解信息丰富图像并生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足。图表到代码生成任务凸显了这一挑战，现有监督微调（SFT）方法存在性能瓶颈，需要有效的RL策略。

Method: 提出了多模态结构化强化学习（MSRL），利用多粒度结构化奖励系统，结合文本和视觉反馈。文本层面采用基于规则的奖励验证代码细节，视觉层面通过生成代码渲染图像并使用评估模型评估结构相似性。采用两阶段课程训练确保稳定性。

Result: MSRL显著突破了SFT的性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准测试上分别提升了6.2%和9.9%的高水平指标。

Conclusion: MSRL方法显著突破了SFT的性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准测试上分别实现了6.2%和9.9%的高水平指标提升，达到了与先进闭源模型竞争的性能。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注一阶逻辑查询，而实际查询常涉及模糊或上下文相关的约束，如属性偏好或相关类别。

Method: 提出了神经查询重新排序器（NQR），通过交互式方式逐步优化答案，结合软约束调整查询答案分数。

Result: 实验表明，NQR能够有效捕捉软约束，同时保持稳健的查询回答性能。

Conclusion: NQR能够在不破坏原始查询答案的情况下，通过软约束调整查询答案分数，并在实验中展现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Conclusion: 本文提出的ITL-LIME框架通过引入实例迁移学习和对比学习编码器，显著提升了在数据受限环境下LIME方法的解释保真度和稳定性。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Conclusion: MHSNet通过多级身份验证框架有效解决了第三方简历与公司人才库中简历的重复检测问题，提升了简历质量并丰富了人才库。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various
tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge.
Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

TL;DR: CausalPlan框架通过结构性因果推理提升LLM在协作任务中的规划能力，减少无效动作并改善协作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在协作任务中常因依赖表面相关性而非因果推理，产生无效或不连贯动作，影响动态环境中的协调与规划能力。

Method: CausalPlan采用两阶段框架，结合结构性因果推理（SCA模型）来指导LLM生成的动作选择，包括因果评分和备选方案。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试中，CausalPlan显著减少了无效动作，并在AI-AI和人类-AI协作中表现优于强化学习基线。

Conclusion: CausalPlan通过将因果推理直接嵌入决策循环，显著减少了无效动作并提升了协作效率，为多智能体LLM系统的部署提供了高效、可解释和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单LLM方法受限于参数知识约束和静态训练语料，难以有效整合复杂临床信息，因此需要多LLM协作框架以提升医疗决策系统的性能。

Method: 提出了EMRC框架，包括专家感知的代理招募阶段和基于信心与对抗的多代理协作阶段，利用公开语料库构建LLM专业表，动态选择最优LLM进行医疗查询响应。

Result: 在三个公共MDM数据集上评估显示，EMRC优于现有单LLM和多LLM方法，如在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上准确率达74.45%，比最佳闭源模型GPT-4-0613提升2.69%。

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的多LLM协作显著提升了医疗决策系统的准确性和可靠性，验证了其在复杂临床信息整合中的有效性。

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于概率上下文无关文法的动态学习实例化方法，通过平衡利用和探索，有效提升了SMT求解器处理量化公式的能力。

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Conclusion: 本研究为多RAG系统集成奠定了基础，证明了无论是在流水线层面还是模块层面，集成多个RAG系统都具有通用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Conclusion: 这些扩展显著提高了（且从未降低）广义计划的质量。在12个领域中，最佳Python程序解决了所有可以由相应实例生成器生成的任务。

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个关键见解，即协同AI代理的涌现行为，并提供了一个设计稳定、有效的AI驱动系统的蓝图。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Motivation: LRS问题是NP难组合优化问题，在基因组重组中具有重要作用，需要高效解决方案。

Method: 使用Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA)解决LRS问题，并开发Max-Min Ant System进行比较，同时应用整数线性规划求解器CPLEX。

Result: 计算结果表明BRKGA是当前LRS问题的最先进技术。

Conclusion: 提出的BRKGA是目前LRS问题的最先进技术，但在处理大字母表输入字符串时仍有改进空间。

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Conclusion: ComputerRL框架通过API-GUI范式结合分布式RL基础设施和Entropulse训练策略，显著提升了桌面自动化中通用代理的性能，AutoGLM-OS-9B在OSWorld基准测试中达到48.1%的最新准确率。

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et
al., 2024a)

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种不确定性感知学习策略，通过结合医生背景知识，显著提高了医学AI在胸部X光诊断中的准确性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医学AI主要依赖目标病灶的重复学习生成诊断，缺乏足够的背景知识，导致诊断不确定性，限制了临床广泛应用。

Method: 研究采用了2,517张无病灶图像和656张结节图像，提出了Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy，旨在通过学习医生的背景知识来补充医学AI的知识缺陷。

Result: 提出的模型达到了92%的准确率（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2），敏感性比基线模型提高了10%，同时将不确定性（熵）降低了0.2。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种不确定性感知学习策略，通过结合医生的背景知识和胸部X光病灶信息，有效减少了医学AI的诊断不确定性，提高了诊断准确性。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

Motivation: 探索随机CSP实例的稀疏化问题，旨在理解稀疏化在不同随机模型中的行为及其阈值现象。

Method: 研究采用了两种随机模型：$r$-分块模型和均匀模型，分析了不同谓词$P$下的稀疏化阈值和稀疏化器构造方法。

Result: 在$r$-分块模型中，稀疏化存在一个尖锐的阈值；均匀模型中稀疏化行为更复杂，可能非单调。

Conclusion: 论文展示了在随机CSP稀疏化问题中，$r$-分块模型和均匀模型的不同行为。$r$-分块模型存在一个尖锐的阈值现象，而均匀模型则更为复杂，稀疏化行为可能非单调。

Abstract: The problem of CSP sparsification asks: for a given CSP instance, what is the
sparsest possible reweighting such that for every possible assignment to the
instance, the number of satisfied constraints is preserved up to a factor of $1
\pm \epsilon$? We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In
particular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and
the uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning
the variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one
vertex out of each part. In the uniform model, $r$ distinct vertices are chosen
at random from the pool of variables to form each constraint.
  In the $r$-partite model, we exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon. For every
predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$
vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and
can be sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^k$. Here, $k$ corresponds
to the largest copy of the AND which can be found within $P$. Furthermore,
these sparsifiers are simple, as they can be constructed by i.i.d. sampling of
the edges.
  In the uniform model, the situation is a bit more complex. For every
predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$
vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and
can sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^{k+1}$. However, for some
predicates $P$, if $m \in [n^k, n^{k+1}]$, there may or may not be a nontrivial
sparsifier. In fact, we show that there are predicates where the
sparsifiability of random instances is non-monotone, i.e., as we add more
random constraints, the instances become more sparsifiable. We give a precise
(efficiently computable) procedure for determining which situation a specific
predicate $P$ falls into.

Result: 证明了简单变体在近似因子2下是NP难问题，并提供了3-近似的一般情况算法。

Conclusion: 论文证明了2D Demand Bin Packing问题在某些变体中是NP难问题，并提供了最佳近似算法。

Abstract: We study a two-dimensional generalization of the classical Bin Packing
problem, denoted as 2D Demand Bin Packing. In this context, each bin is a
horizontal timeline, and rectangular tasks (representing electric appliances or
computational requirements) must be allocated into the minimum number of bins
so that the sum of the heights of tasks at any point in time is at most a given
constant capacity. We prove that simple variants of the problem are NP-hard to
approximate within a factor better than $2$, namely when tasks have short
height and when they are squares, and provide best-possible approximation
algorithms for them; we also present a simple $3$-approximation for the general
case. All our algorithms are based on a general framework that computes
structured solutions for relatively large tasks, while including relatively
small tasks on top via a generalization of the well-known First-Fit algorithm
for Bin Packing.

Motivation: 当前并发优先级队列缺乏对双端操作（如ExtractMax）的原生支持，限制了其应用场景。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将两个线性化的单消费者优先级队列组合成一个线性化的双消费者DEPQ，并利用基于锁的组合方案扩展多消费者支持。

Result: 成功实现了线性化的双消费者DEPQ，并展示了其在基于列表的优先级队列中的应用。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种专门为双端优先级队列（DEPQ）设计的首个并发实现，通过扩展现有并发优先级队列的功能，支持了ExtractMax操作，并保持了线性化和无锁特性。此外，还展示了如何通过基于锁的组合方案支持多消费者操作。

Abstract: This work provides the first concurrent implementation specifically designed
for a double-ended priority queue (DEPQ). We do this by describing a general
way to add an ExtractMax operation to any concurrent priority queue that
already supports Insert and ExtractMin operations. The construction uses two
linearizable single-consumer priority queues to build a linearizable
dual-consumer DEPQ (only one process can perform Extract operations at each
end). This construction preserves lock-freedom. We then describe how to use a
lock-based combining scheme to allow multiple consumers at each end of the
DEPQ. To illustrate the technique, we apply it to a list-based priority queue.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了针对不同系列-平行图生成非等价生成树的算法，并讨论了未定向系列-平行图的开放问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of generating the spanning trees of
a graph $G$ up to the automorphisms or "symmetries" of $G$. After introducing
and surveying this problem for general input graphs, we present algorithms that
fully solve the case of series-parallel graphs, under two standard definitions.
We first show how to generate the nonequivalent spanning trees of a oriented
series-parallel graph $G$ in output-linear time, where both terminals of $G$
have been individually distinguished (i.e. applying an automorphism that
exchanges the terminals produces a different series-parallel graph).
Subsequently, we show how to adapt these oriented algorithms to the case of
semioriented series-parallel graphs, where we still have a set of two
distinguished terminals but neither has been designated as a source or sink.
Finally, we discuss the case of unoriented series-parallel graphs, where no
terminals have been distinguished and present a few observations and open
questions relating to them. The algorithms we present generate the
nonequivalent spanning trees of $G$ but never explicitly compute the
automorphism group of $G$, revealing how the recursive structure of $G$'s
automorphism group mirrors that of its spanning trees.

Result: 研究结果表明，除了有向路径，星形图是唯一在有向树宽方面表现良好的有向图。

Conclusion: 本文的主要结论是，除了有向路径外，唯一在有向树宽方面表现良好的有向图是星形图。

Abstract: It is well known that directed treewidth does not enjoy the nice algorithmic
properties of its undirected counterpart. There exist, however, some positive
results that, essentially, present XP algorithms for the problem of finding, in
a given digraph $D$, a subdigraph isomorphic to a digraph $H$ that can be
formed by the union of $k$ directed paths (with some extra properties),
parameterized by $k$ and the directed treewidth of $D$. Our motivation is to
tackle the following question: Are there subdigraphs, other than the directed
paths, that can be found efficiently in digraphs of bounded directed treewidth?
In a nutshell, the main message of this article is that, other than the
directed paths, the only digraphs that seem to behave well with respect to
directed treewidth are the stars. For this, we present a number of positive and
negative results, generalizing several results in the literature, as well as
some directions for further research.

TL;DR: MELISO+是一个全栈分布式框架，通过两级错误校正和分布式RRAM计算，显著提升能效和计算性能，适用于高维度计算任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构因高能耗数据移动而无法满足全球计算需求的指数增长，而RRAM内存计算虽能解决这一问题，但面临设备非理想性和大规模计算任务扩展性差的挑战。

Method: MELISO+提出了一种新颖的两级错误校正机制来缓解设备非理想性，并开发了一个分布式RRAM计算框架，支持超过65,000×65,000维度的矩阵计算。

Result: 该方法将设备非理想性导致的一阶和二阶算术误差减少了90%以上，能效提高了三到五个数量级，延迟降低了100倍，使低精度RRAM设备在准确性、能耗和延迟指标上超越高精度设备。

Conclusion: MELISO+通过算法-硬件协同设计和可扩展架构，显著推动了可持续、高维度计算的发展，适用于大型语言模型和生成式AI等应用。

Abstract: Exponential growth in global computing demand is exacerbated due to the
higher-energy requirements of conventional architectures, primarily due to
energy-intensive data movement. In-memory computing with Resistive Random
Access Memory (RRAM) addresses this by co-integrating memory and processing,
but faces significant hurdles related to device-level non-idealities and poor
scalability for large computing tasks. Here, we introduce \textbf{MELISO+}
(In-\textbf{Me}mory \textbf{Li}near \textbf{So}lver), a full-stack, distributed
framework for energy-efficient in-memory computing. MELISO+ proposes a novel
two-tier error correction mechanism to mitigate device non-idealities and
develops a distributed RRAM computing framework to enable matrix computations
exceeding dimensions of $65,000 \times 65,000$. This approach reduces first-
and second-order arithmetic errors due to device non-idealities by over 90\%,
enhances energy efficiency by three to five orders of magnitude, and decreases
latency 100-fold. Hence, MELISO+ allows lower-precision RRAM devices to
outperform high-precision device alternatives in accuracy, energy and latency
metrics. By unifying algorithm-hardware co-design with scalable architecture,
MELISO+ significantly advances sustainable, high-dimensional computing suitable
for applications like large language models and generative AI.

Result: 持久性MPI通信比基线通信提速最高37%，分区MPI通信提速最高68%。

Conclusion: 持久性和分区MPI通信优化在迭代模板操作中显著提升了性能，持久性通信最高提速37%，分区通信最高提速68%。

Abstract: Many parallel applications rely on iterative stencil operations, whose
performance are dominated by communication costs at large scales. Several MPI
optimizations, such as persistent and partitioned communication, reduce
overheads and improve communication efficiency through amortized setup costs
and reduced synchronization of threaded sends. This paper presents the
performance of stencil communication in the Comb benchmarking suite when using
non blocking, persistent, and partitioned communication routines. The impact of
each optimization is analyzed at various scales. Further, the paper presents an
analysis of the impact of process count, thread count, and message size on
partitioned communication routines. Measured timings show that persistent MPI
communication can provide a speedup of up to 37% over the baseline MPI
communication, and partitioned MPI communication can provide a speedup of up to
68%.

Conclusion: OrbitChain通过协同多卫星资源，实现了实时地球观测分析，显著提升了分析效率并降低了通信开销。

Abstract: Earth observation analytics have the potential to serve many time-sensitive
applications. However, due to limited bandwidth and duration of
ground-satellite connections, it takes hours or even days to download and
analyze data from existing Earth observation satellites, making real-time
demands like timely disaster response impossible. Toward real-time analytics,
we introduce OrbitChain, a collaborative analytics framework that orchestrates
computational resources across multiple satellites in an Earth observation
constellation. OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices
and allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic
routing algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication
overhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth
observation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and
inter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue. To evaluate OrbitChain,
we implement a hardware-in-the-loop orbital computing testbed. Experiments show
that our system can complete up to 60% analytics workload than existing Earth
observation analytics framework while reducing the communication overhead by up
to 72%.

Abstract: Large inter-GPU all-reduce operations, prevalent throughout deep learning,
are bottlenecked by communication costs. Emerging heterogeneous architectures
are comprised of complex nodes, often containing $4$ GPUs and dozens to
hundreds of CPU cores per node. Parallel applications are typically accelerated
on the available GPUs, using only a single CPU core per GPU while the remaining
cores sit idle. This paper presents novel optimizations to large GPU-aware
all-reduce operations, extending lane-aware reductions to the GPUs, and notably
using multiple CPU cores per GPU to accelerate these operations. These
multi-CPU-accelerated GPU-aware lane all-reduces yield speedup of up to $2.45$x
for large MPI all-reduces across the NVIDIA A100 GPUs of NCSA's Delta
supercomputer. Finally, the approach is extended to NVIDIA's and AMD's
collective communication libraries, achieving speedup of up to $1.77$x and
$1.71$x, respectively, across $2$ state-of-the-art supercomputers.

Result: 提出了LUNDIsim数据集，一个受SPE10比较挑战启发的断层地质网格，用于基准测试和评估数据大小减少或压缩算法。

Conclusion: LUNDIsim地质网格数据集为评估数据大小减少（上采样）或真正的复合网格压缩算法提供了基准，同时也适用于地质和储层工程中的其他高级网格处理工作流程。

Abstract: The volume of scientific data produced for and by numerical simulation
workflows is increasing at an incredible rate. This raises concerns either in
computability, interpretability, and sustainability. This is especially
noticeable in earth science (geology, meteorology, oceanography, and
astronomy), notably with climate studies.
  We highlight five main evaluation issues: efficiency, discrepancy, diversity,
interpretability, availability.
  Among remedies, lossless and lossy compression techniques are becoming
popular to better manage dataset volumes. Performance assessment -- with
comparative benchmarks -- require open datasets shared under FAIR principles
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), with MRE (Minimal Reproducible
Example) ancillary data for reuse. We share LUNDIsim, an exemplary faulted
geological mesh. It is inspired by SPE10 comparative Challenge. Enhanced by
porosity/permeability datasets, this dataset proposes four distinct subsurface
environments. They were primarily designed for flow simulation in porous media.
Several consistent resolutions (with HexaShrink multiscale representations) are
proposed for each model. We also provide a set of reservoir features for
reproducing typical two-phase flow simulations on all LUNDIsim models in a
reservoir engineering context. This dataset is chiefly meant for benchmarking
and evaluating data size reduction (upscaling) or genuine composite mesh
compression algorithms. It is also suitable for other advanced mesh processing
workflows in geology and reservoir engineering, from visualization to machine
learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing
graph-structured data prevalent in various real-world applications. However,
the scalability of full-batch GNN training becomes severely limited by high
communication overhead and load imbalance in distributed environments. In this
paper, we present CaPGNN, a novel framework for efficient parallel full-batch
GNN training on single-server with multi-GPU, designed specifically to reduce
redundant inter-GPU communication and balance computational workloads. We
propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU
memory to significantly reduce the repetitive transmission of vertex features
across partitions. Additionally, we introduce a resource-aware graph
partitioning algorithm that adjusts subgraph sizes dynamically according to the
heterogeneous computational and communication capacities of GPUs. Extensive
experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that CaPGNN
effectively reduces communication costs by up to 96% and accelerates GNN
training by up to 12.7 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our
results highlight the potential of adaptive caching and resource-aware
partitioning to facilitate scalable, efficient, and practical deployment of
full-batch GNN training in distributed computing environments.

Abstract: The pace of RISC-V adoption continues to grow rapidly, yet for the successes
enjoyed in areas such as embedded computing, RISC-V is yet to gain ubiquity in
High Performance Computing (HPC). The Sophon SG2044 is SOPHGO's next generation
64-core high performance CPU that has been designed for workstation and server
grade workloads. Building upon the SG2042, subsystems that were a bottleneck in
the previous generation have been upgraded.
  In this paper we undertake the first performance study of the SG2044 for HPC.
Comparing against the SG2042 and other architectures, we find that the SG2044
is most advantageous when running at higher core counts, delivering up to 4.91
greater performance than the SG2042 over 64-cores. Two of the most important
upgrades in the SG2044 are support for RVV v1.0 and an enhanced memory
subsystem. This results in the SG2044 significantly closing the performance gap
with other architectures, especially for compute-bound workloads.

*Dangfeng Pan,Zhensu Sun,Cenyuan Zhang,David Lo,Xiaoning Du*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现移除代码格式元素可显著减少LLM的输入令牌数（24.5%），而不影响性能，提示和微调还能进一步优化输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究代码格式化元素对大型语言模型性能和效率的影响，以减少不必要的计算成本和响应时间。

Method: 通过大规模实验，在四种编程语言和十种LLM上系统地分析了格式化元素移除后的令牌计数和性能。

Result: LLM在格式化代码和非格式化代码上性能相当，平均输入令牌减少24.5%，输出令牌减少可忽略不计。提示和微调可以进一步减少输出代码长度（最高36.1%）。

Conclusion: 代码格式的移除可以作为一种实用的优化策略，提高LLM的效率，同时保持性能。

Abstract: Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines
to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not
seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since
the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these
additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response
times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can
reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played
by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate
the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through
large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four
programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both
commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and
performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that
LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,
achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output
token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization
strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both
prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to
36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate
practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for
format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM
inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个多维代码生成评估框架，强调正确性、效率和代码质量，评估发现高正确性模型未必高效或可维护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要关注功能正确性，而忽略了算法效率和代码质量这两个现实编程中的关键方面。

Method: 引入COMPASS评估框架，包含50个编程问题，利用行业标准分析工具系统评估代码的运行效率和代码质量。

Result: 对三个领先推理增强模型的评估显示，高正确性得分的模型不一定能生成高效算法或可维护代码。

Conclusion: COMPASS框架强调了评估代码生成模型时需综合考虑正确性、效率和代码质量的重要性，为未来研究提供了方向，以实现更健壮、可靠且适用于生产环境的AI系统。

Abstract: Current code generation benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness
while overlooking two critical aspects of real-world programming: algorithmic
efficiency and code quality. We introduce COMPASS (COdility's Multi-dimensional
Programming ASSessment), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses
code generation across three dimensions: correctness, efficiency, and quality.
COMPASS consists of 50 competitive programming problems from real Codility
competitions, providing authentic human baselines from 393,150 submissions.
Unlike existing benchmarks that treat algorithmically inefficient solutions
identically to optimal ones provided they pass test cases, COMPASS
systematically evaluates runtime efficiency and code quality using
industry-standard analysis tools. Our evaluation of three leading
reasoning-enhanced models, Anthropic Claude Opus 4, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and
OpenAI O4-Mini-High, reveals that models achieving high correctness scores do
not necessarily produce efficient algorithms or maintainable code. These
findings highlight the importance of evaluating more than just correctness to
truly understand the real-world capabilities of code generation models. COMPASS
serves as a guiding framework, charting a path for future research toward AI
systems that are robust, reliable, and ready for production use.

Motivation: 理解大规模软件生态系统的结构特征和连接模式对增强软件重用、提高生态系统韧性和减轻安全风险至关重要。

Method: 利用Goblin框架提取了基于度中心性的前5,000个高度连接的工件样本，并通过广度优先搜索（BFS）扩展捕获了可达的库和版本。分析了包含130万个节点和2090万条边的图，计算了度分布、介数中心性、PageRank中心性和连通分量等图论指标。

Result: Maven Central具有高度互联、无标度和小的世界拓扑结构，核心基础设施枢纽（如测试框架和通用工具库）主导了生态系统。这些枢纽的存在既促进了效率，也带来了系统性风险。

Conclusion: Maven Central生态系统表现出高度互联、无标度和小世界拓扑结构，由少数基础设施枢纽支持大多数项目。这些枢纽虽然促进了软件重用和集成，但也带来了系统性风险。

Abstract: Understanding the structural characteristics and connectivity patterns of
large-scale software ecosystems is critical for enhancing software reuse,
improving ecosystem resilience, and mitigating security risks. In this paper,
we investigate the Maven Central ecosystem, one of the largest repositories of
Java libraries, by applying network science techniques to its dependency graph.
Leveraging the Goblin framework, we extracted a sample consisting of the top
5,000 highly connected artifacts based on their degree centrality and then
performed breadth-first search (BFS) expansion from each selected artifact as a
seed node, traversing the graph outward to capture all libraries and releases
reachable those seed nodes. This sampling strategy captured the immediate
structural context surrounding these libraries resulted in a curated graph
comprising of 1.3 million nodes and 20.9 million edges. We conducted a
comprehensive analysis of this graph, computing degree distributions,
betweenness centrality, PageRank centrality, and connected components
graph-theoretic metrics. Our results reveal that Maven Central exhibits a
highly interconnected, scale-free, and small-world topology, characterized by a
small number of infrastructural hubs that support the majority of projects.
Further analysis using PageRank and betweenness centrality shows that these
hubs predominantly consist of core ecosystem infrastructure, including testing
frameworks and general-purpose utility libraries. While these hubs facilitate
efficient software reuse and integration, they also pose systemic risks;
failures or vulnerabilities affecting these critical nodes can have widespread
and cascading impacts throughout the ecosystem.

TL;DR: 新方法通过动态编程和细粒度分析减少多核WCET估计中的缓存干扰高估问题，实验效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多核架构下WCET估计的挑战主要源于多核共享缓存的复杂访问，现有方法因不考虑实际缓存状态和访问数量而高估了远程块访问导致的缓存未命中。

Method: 基于任务中程序区域的顺序，首先识别可能受远程访问影响的内存引用，然后构建细粒度的争用分析，根据本地和远程块的访问量计算缓存未命中数。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法相比，该分析平均减少了52.31%的核间缓存干扰和8.94%的WCET估计，且未显著增加计算开销。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的分析方法，通过动态编程计算任务的核间缓存干扰，显著减少了WCET的高估问题。

Abstract: WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is
particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared
by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between
parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program
regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by
a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number
of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention.
Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory
references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region.
Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the
number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks.
We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be
obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing
methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET
estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing
computation overhead.

Result: 在七个合成场景上的实验表明，PreSem-Surf在C-L1、F-score和IoU指标上表现最佳，同时在NC、Accuracy和Completeness方面也保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PreSem-Surf 在多个评估指标上表现出色，尤其是在C-L1、F-score和IoU方面表现最佳，同时在NC、Accuracy和Completeness方面也保持竞争力，证明了其有效性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while
maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,
demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的多级弹性动力学时间步求解器在保持IPC方法稳健性的同时，显著提升了计算效率，最高可达13倍加速。

Abstract: We present a multi-level elastodynamics timestep solver for accelerating
incremental potential contact (IPC) simulations. Our method retains the
robustness of gold standard IPC in the face of intricate geometry, complex
heterogeneous material distributions and high resolution input data without
sacrificing visual fidelity (per-timestep relative displacement error of
$\approx1\%$). The success of our method is enabled by a novel, sparse,
geometry- and material-aware basis construction method which allows for the use
of fast preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers (in place of a sparse direct
solver), but without suffering convergence issues due to stiff or heterogeneous
materials. The end result is a solver that produces results visually
indistinguishable and quantitatively very close to gold-standard IPC methods
but up to $13\times$ faster on identical hardware.

Motivation: 传统学习方法在生成边界约束的平面图时，需要将向量数据转换为栅格图像，再通过图像生成模型转换回向量数据，这一过程复杂且冗余，容易导致信息损失。

Method: DiffPlanner 是一个 Transformer 架构的条件扩散模型，通过引入对齐机制，将模型的优化轨迹与设计师的迭代设计过程对齐。

Conclusion: DiffPlanner 是一种基于 Transformer 的条件扩散模型，直接在向量空间中操作，避免了传统方法中向量到栅格转换的信息损失问题，显著提升了生成结果的精度和可控性。

Abstract: The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the
topological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary.
Recently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating
realistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting
vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then
converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and
redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector
data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these
issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for
boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector
space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that
integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization
trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This
enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of
the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout
design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative
comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual
studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor
plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability
to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground
truths.

Conclusion: Sketch3DVE 提出了一种基于草图的3D感知视频编辑方法，能够有效处理视频中的显著视角变化，并通过3D信息分析和编辑实现了局部细节的精确操控。实验证明了该方法在视频编辑中的优越性。

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports
science.

Motivation: 构建一个移动监控机器人，实时传输视频并响应语音，用户可通过手机或浏览器监控和操控它。

Method: 系统使用两个Raspberry Pi 4单元：一个前端单元安装在差速驱动底座上，配备摄像头、麦克风和扬声器；一个中央单元提供实时视频流并运行感知功能。视频通过FFmpeg发送。使用YOLOv3检测场景中的物体以支持导航和事件感知。语音交互采用Python库进行语音识别、多语言翻译和文本转语音。

Conclusion: 该设计依赖现成硬件和开源软件，易于复制。论文讨论了限制和实际扩展，包括与超声波测距数据的传感器融合、GPU加速以及添加人脸和文本识别。

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对越野自主性中的实时规划需求，传统方法如图运动基元和 Hybrid A* (HA*) 在复杂动力学下存在效率问题，IGHA* 旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了 Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*)，一种动态组织顶点扩展的树搜索框架，避免了刚性剪枝。

Result: IGHA* 在车辆运动规划中比 HA* 减少了 6 倍的扩展次数，并在模拟和实际测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: IGHA* 在模拟和实际小型越野车辆上展示了实时性能，实现了在复杂动力学下的快速、鲁棒规划。

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large
trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to
aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time
planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and
exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions
efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point
boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic
planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of
motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based
dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse
risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.
We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search
framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.
IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and
off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*
use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version
of HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*
outperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive
controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a
small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex
dynamics. Code: https://github.com/personalrobotics/IGHAStar

TL;DR: 提出基于Benders分解的方法，解决双足运动中的非凸约束问题，实验证明比替代算法更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双足运动应用中，非凸约束（如运动可达性和脚步旋转）加剧了混合整数规划（MIP）的计算复杂度，导致求解整个单一优化问题变得难以处理。

Method: 采用Benders分解的迭代切割平面技术，将问题分为主问题（用于生成满足任务规范的规划）和一系列子问题（用于运动学和动力学可行性检查）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在非线性约束下的优化程序求解中比替代算法更快。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于Benders分解的方法，用于解决在双足运动应用中由于非凸约束（如运动可达性和脚步旋转）导致的混合整数规划（MIP）计算复杂度问题。实验证明，该方法在非线性约束下的优化程序求解中比替代算法更快。

Abstract: Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to
be NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems,
which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as
mixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion,
introduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and
footstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this
work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios
where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively
intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane
technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan
that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics
and dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
achieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the
resulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged

standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in
real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We

representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets
in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree
G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a
quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In
the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using
commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future
work to for benchmarking embodied AI.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通过反事实重新标注增强机器人数据集，提升VLA模型在细粒度指令遵循上的表现，导航任务成功率提高27%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在遵循细粒度指令方面存在困难，主要原因是现有机器人数据集缺乏语义多样性和语言基础，尤其是针对相似观察的细粒度任务多样性不足。

Method: 提出了一种利用视觉语言模型创建反事实标签的新方法，以增强现有机器人数据集的语言多样性和细粒度任务多样性。

Result: 在3种不同室内外环境中进行的视觉语言导航实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型遵循语言指令的能力，从简单的对象中心命令到复杂的参考任务。

Conclusion: 通过反事实重新标注方法，无需额外数据收集，显著提升了VLA策略的指令遵循能力，使其在导航任务中的成功率提高了27%，与现有最先进方法相媲美。

Abstract: Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions,
but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following
fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping
open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for
this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot
datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar
observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing
robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual
labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by
increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot
datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the
resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple
object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual
language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments.
Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any
additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA
policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing
success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.

Result: 通过协同仿真和硬件在环实验验证了FT-LTVMPC的高精度控制和实时性能。

Conclusion: FT-LTVMPC策略在AWOISV中实现了高精度的位置和航向控制，同时确保了优异的实时性能。

Abstract: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) is a
specialized all-wheel independent steering vehicle with each wheel capable of
steering up to 90{\deg}, enabling unique maneuvers like yaw and diagonal
movement. This paper introduces a theoretical steering radius angle and
sideslip angle (\( \theta_R \)-\(\beta_R \)) representation, based on the
position of the instantaneous center of rotation relative to the wheel rotation
center, defining the motion modes and switching criteria for AWOISVs. A
generalized \( v\)-\(\beta\)-\(r \) dynamic model is developed with forward
velocity \(v\), sideslip angle \(\beta\), and yaw rate \(r\) as states, and
\(\theta_R\) and \(\beta_R\) as control inputs. This model decouples
longitudinal and lateral motions into forward and rotational motions, allowing
seamless transitions across all motion modes under specific conditions. A
filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) strategy is proposed,
achieving simultaneous tracking of lateral position and arbitrary heading
angles, with robustness to model inaccuracies and parameter uncertainties.
Co-simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments confirm that FT-LTVMPC
enables high-precision control of both position and heading while ensuring
excellent real-time performance.

Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet
unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and
delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to
navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,
corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and
humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs
are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general
multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain
distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.
Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,
which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods
specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.
However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on
centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,
etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These
assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described
informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for
comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc
representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting
to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own
taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research
moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a
well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROVER是一种闭环验证方法，利用历史轨迹先验拒绝错误闭环，适用于重复环境，提升了SLAM系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重复环境中，基于外观的特征容易失效，导致错误闭环检测。现有方法忽视机器人时空运动线索（轨迹）的先验知识，因此需要一种利用轨迹先验的闭环验证方法。

Method: ROVER通过闭环候选估计机器人轨迹，并结合姿态图优化和评分方案，评估其与无闭环轨迹（轨迹先验）的一致性，以决定是否接受闭环。

Result: 基准测试和真实实验验证了ROVER的有效性，集成到先进SLAM系统中也证明了其鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: ROVER方法通过利用历史轨迹作为先验约束，在具有挑战性的重复环境中有效拒绝错误闭环，提高了SLAM系统的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

Motivation: 为解决模块化机械臂在不同形态下控制参数调优复杂的问题，提出一种统一的控制框架，以提升控制精度和适应性。

Method: H-MPC分为高层MPC和低层MPC：高层预测未来状态并提供轨迹信息，低层基于高层信息更新预测模型以细化控制动作。低层MPC还通过高层预测信息引入次级线性化，捕捉运动学模型的二阶泰勒展开信息，同时保持线性化模型形式。

Result: 实验验证了H-MPC在不同形态机械臂上的有效性，成功执行了真实场景中的抓取-放置任务。

Conclusion: 提出的分层模型预测控制（H-MPC）通过高低层MPC的协同工作，能够适应不同形态的模块化机械臂，无需大量参数调优，显著提升了控制精度和可靠性。

Abstract: This work proposes a unified Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (H-MPC)
for modular manipulators across various morphologies, as the controller can
adapt to different configurations to execute the given task without extensive
parameter tuning in the controller. The H-MPC divides the control process into
two levels: a high-level MPC and a low-level MPC. The high-level MPC predicts
future states and provides trajectory information, while the low-level MPC
refines control actions by updating the predictive model based on this
high-level information. This hierarchical structure allows for the integration
of kinematic constraints and ensures smooth joint-space trajectories, even near
singular configurations. Moreover, the low-level MPC incorporates secondary
linearization by leveraging predictive information from the high-level MPC,
effectively capturing the second-order Taylor expansion information of the
kinematic model while still maintaining a linearized model formulation. This
approach not only preserves the simplicity of a linear control model but also
enhances the accuracy of the kinematic representation, thereby improving
overall control precision and reliability. To validate the effectiveness of the
control policy, we conduct extensive evaluations across different manipulator
morphologies and demonstrate the execution of pick-and-place tasks in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and
robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model
uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the
full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in
whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving
horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate
noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for
disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body
disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous
two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on
whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with
uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external
disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid
and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped
robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC
under various disturbance conditions.

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

Motivation: 随着自主机器人在公共空间的普及，需要研究如何通过机器人的运动策略提高透明度和减少潜在风险。

Method: 在实地环境中，观察了498名行人与两种自主清洁机器人互动时的行为，分析机器人类型和运动模式对行人（包括分心与未分心）的影响。

Result: 分心与未分心行人在机器人周围的行为无显著差异，但大型机器人和偏移矩形运动模式显著增加了横向调整行为。

Conclusion: 研究为公共空间中行人行为与自主机器人的交互提供了初步见解，支持了HRI领域的发展。

Abstract: As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous
encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be
equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and
reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic
strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions,
and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated
the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research
has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research
addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and
undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware
pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning
robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by
smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit
significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead,
both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern
significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the
smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset
rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral
adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to
differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial
insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot
in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.

Abstract: In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site
and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to
be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and
properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in
material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow
and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological
properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for
the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In
this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a
robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based
navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first
processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting
the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D
cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D
domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.
We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while
suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for
down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable
autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection
parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity
and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This
allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal
point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system
in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests. A

Motivation: 解决四旋翼系统非线性动力学实时控制的挑战，提升轨迹跟踪精度并降低计算时间。

Method: 通过深度Koopman算子从飞行数据中学习高维潜在表示，将非线性动力学近似为线性模型，并结合模型预测控制（MPC）优化控制动作。

Result: 在轨迹跟踪和点稳定实验中，DK-MPC表现出优于传统非线性MPC的跟踪精度和显著降低的计算时间。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了基于深度Koopman算子的数据驱动控制框架（DK-MPC）在四旋翼系统中的潜力，未来工作将扩展到更敏捷的飞行场景并提升对外部干扰的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems
that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC).
The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a
high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor
dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the
application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite
prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization.
The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of
trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it
demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation
time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the
potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor
dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control.
Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight
scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.

TL;DR: SGDT框架通过神经符号机制和因果变换器，首次实现了基于DT技术的多机器人操作，解决了强化学习在实际应用中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人操作中表现出巨大潜力，但其数据密集性和对MDP假设的依赖限制了其在复杂动态和长期时间依赖性场景中的实际应用。决策变换器（DTs）作为离线替代方案尚未充分探索多机器人操作。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的框架——符号引导决策变换器（SGDT），结合神经符号规划器和目标条件决策变换器（GCDT）进行分层决策。

Result: SGDT在零样本和少样本场景中表现优异，为多机器人协作提供了有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: SGDT框架通过结合神经符号机制和因果变换器，为多机器人协作提供了结构化、可解释和可推广的决策方法，首次探索了基于DT技术的多机器人操作。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic
operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world
scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such
as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a
promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence
modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations
still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,
Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a
neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable
multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic
planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic
subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer
(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot
manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,
and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.
We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用LLMs生成语义信息来增强驾驶风格识别的方法，显著提升了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶风格识别系统依赖低级别传感器特征，忽略了人类专家的语义推理能力，导致算法分类与专家判断不一致。

Method: 提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLMs）生成自然语言描述的框架，通过文本嵌入和降维将其转换为机器学习兼容的表示，并作为特权信息集成到SVM+中进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，SPI增强的框架在真实驾驶场景中表现优于传统方法，F1分数提升了7.6%（跟车）和7.9%（变道）。

Conclusion: 该研究通过整合语义特权信息（SPI）显著提升了驾驶风格识别的准确性和可解释性，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Existing driving style recognition systems largely depend on low-level
sensor-derived features for training, neglecting the rich semantic reasoning
capability inherent to human experts. This discrepancy results in a fundamental
misalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic
Privileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align
recognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning. First, we introduce
DriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language
descriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are then encoded into
machine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and
dimensionality reduction. Finally, we incorporate them as privileged
information into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the
model to approximate human-like interpretation patterns. Experiments across
diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced
framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of
7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing). Importantly, SPI is exclusively
used during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring
computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. These results
highlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving
recognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving
systems.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world,
generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional

systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series
Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core

semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this
comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the
foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal
integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we
outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data
models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized
benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management
solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than

Abstract: As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering
trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective
and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must
promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or
overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,
HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and
avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical
concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for
building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We
emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the
robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate
its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,
robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs
while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over
their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important
for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true
capabilities.

Conclusion: 本文总结了关于理解和建模人机交互社会背景的开放研究问题。

Abstract: The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social
context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing,
and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social
context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it
challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and
modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,
we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term
"social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social
context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and
we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers
plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights
after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open
research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social
contexts of human-robot interactions.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种以‘指向’为核心的通用中间表示方法，结合RFT训练范式，为缩小机器人感知与行动之间的差距提供了一条有效且可推广的路径。

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which
stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we
pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate
representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge
high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We
introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed
for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and
general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale
dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing
capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced
Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.
Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and
pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot
generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%
across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,
representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model
exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows
that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,
offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action
gap in robotics.

Conclusion: GEM系统通过熵优化框架，在仅有少量演示的情况下，实现了动态物体操作的强泛化能力，并在实际场景中取得了97%以上的成功率。

Abstract: Realizing generalizable dynamic object manipulation is important for
enhancing manufacturing efficiency, as it eliminates specialized engineering
for various scenarios. To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising
paradigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation
skills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be
improved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is
labor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper investigates whether
strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation is achievable with only a
few demonstrations. Specifically, we develop an entropy-based theoretical
framework to quantify the optimization of imitation learning. Based on this
framework, we propose a system named Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation
(GEM). Extensive experiments in simulated and real tasks demonstrate that GEM
can generalize across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments,
motion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM has been deployed in a
real canteen for tableware collection. Without any in-scene demonstration, it
achieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations.

Abstract: The fifth-generation (5G) of cellular communications is expected to be
deployed in the next years to support a wide range of services with different
demands of peak data rates, latency and quality of experience (QoE). To support
higher data rates and latency requirements third-generation partnership project
(3GPP) has introduced numerology and bandwidth parts (BWPs), via new radio (NR)
for service-tailored resource allocation. Legacy 4G networks have generated
extensive data, which combined with crowd-sourced LTE infrastructure insights,
enables identification of high-traffic 5G deployment area (5GDA) for planning
new services. Given the mission-critical nature of 5G services, QoE is a big
challenge for MNOs to guarantee peak data rates for a defined percentage of
time. This work studies the fundamentals of 5G network planning methods that
reconciles coverage-capacity trade-offs through balanced radio network
dimensioning (RND), leveraging pragmatic NR modeling, and data-driven
strategies to minimize deployment costs and reduce cost-per-bit.

Conclusion: SEL-AMR算法通过子图嵌入学习结构，成功解决了传统基于深度学习的AMR算法对特定信道和系统的依赖问题，能够适应任何动态信道和系统，并在识别精度和准确性上显著优于现有算法。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) detects
  modulation schemes of received signals for further processing
  of signals without any priori information, which is critically
  important for civil spectrum regulation, information countermea sures, and
communication security. Due to the powerful feature
  extraction and classification capabilities of Deep Learning (DL),
  DL-based AMR algorithms have achieved excellent performance
  gains compared with traditional modulation detection algorithms.
  However, all existing DL-based AMR algorithms, to the best of
  our knowledge, are designed for specific channels and systems,
  because data dimension of the used training dataset is fixed. To
  this end, we takes the first step to propose a Subgraph Embedding
  Learning (SEL) structure to address the classical AMR problem,
  and the proposed algorithm is called SEL-AMR. Our algorithm
  treats the communication system as a subgraph and uses the
  relationship between samples to smooth the effects brought by
  noise and different channels to extract robust features. Thus,
  the proposed SEL-AMR algorithm can adapt to any dynamic
  channels and systems. We use 5 public real datasets and a small
  amount of simulation data to evaluate our SEL-AMR algorithm.
  Experimental results reveal that SEL-AMR can well adapt to
  different channels and systems, and always outperforms the state of-the-art
algorithms by improving up to 20% macro-average
  recognition precision and 30% recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: CountingStars 通过数字孪生系统和端口聚合数据结构，有效解决了 PBLB 带来的内存膨胀和哈希冲突问题，显著降低了内存使用和测量误差，并展示了在实际系统中部署的潜力。

Abstract: The high mobility of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) mega-constellations
induces a highly dynamic network topology, leading to many problems like
frequent service disruptions. To mitigate this, Packet-based Load Balancing
(PBLB) is employed. However, this paradigm shift introduces two critical
challenges for network measurement stemming from the requirement for port-level
granularity: memory inflation and severe hash collisions. To tackle these
challenges, we propose CountingStars, a low-overhead network-wide measurement
architecture. In the ground controller, CountingStars builds a digital twins
system to accurately predict the future network topology. This allows ground
controller to generate and distribute collision-free hash seeds to satellites
in advance. On the satellite, we introduce a port aggregation data structure
that decouples the unique flow identifier from its multi-port counter and
updates it through efficient bit operations, solving the memory inflation
caused by PBLB. Simulation results show that the memory usage of CountingStars
is reduced by 70\% on average, and the relative error of measurement is reduced
by 90\% on average. Implementation on FPGA shows its prospect to deploy in real
system.

Abstract: The service-based architecture of 5G network allows network operators to
place virtualized network functions on commodity hardware, unlike the
traditional vendor-specific hardware-based functionalities. However, it expands
the security vulnerabilities and threats to the 5G network. While there exist
several theoretical studies on network function placement and service routing,
a few focused on the security aspects of the 5G network systems.
  This paper focuses on safeguarding the 5G core network systems from DoS and
DDoS attacks by placing intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS-IPS) as
virtualized network functions following the 5G standalone architecture. To
ensure the virtualized placement of IDS-IPS, first, we provide thorough virtual
machine (VM)-based and containerized implementation details and evaluate the
network performance with two scenarios, IDS and IPS, in the presence of TCP and
UDP applications. Second, we apply the VM-based implementation of IDS-IPS on a
softwarized 5G core network and study the network performances. The experiment
results on network throughput, latency, and packet drop reveal that the
softwarized IDS-IPS can meet the QoS requirements of 5G applications, while
safeguarding the network from DoS and DDoS attacks.

Abstract: As the automotive industry transitions toward centralized Linux-based
architectures, ensuring the predictable execution of mixed-criticality
applications becomes essential. However, concurrent use of the Linux network
stack introduces interference, resulting in unpredictable latency and jitter.
To address this challenge, we present a layered software architecture that
enforces timing isolation for Ethernet-based data exchange between
mixed-criticality applications on Linux-based automotive control units. Our
approach integrates traffic prioritization strategies at the middleware layer,
the network stack layer, and the hardware layer to achieve isolation across the
full software stack. At the middleware layer, we implement a fixed-priority,
non-preemptive scheduler to manage publishers of varying criticality. At the
network layer, we leverage the express data path (XDP) to route high-priority
data directly from the network interface driver into critical application
memory, bypassing the standard Linux network stack. At the hardware layer, we
dedicate a network interface card (NIC) queue exclusively to real-time traffic.
We demonstrate how our architecture performs in a Data Distribution Service
(DDS)-based system. Our evaluation shows that the approach leads to consistent
and predictable latencies for real-time traffic, even under heavy interference
from best-effort applications.

Abstract: ISAC is emerging as a foundational capability in 6G, enabling mobile networks
to not only offer communication services but also to sense and perceive their
environment at scale. This paper explores architectural considerations to
enable sensing in 6G, extending on recent developments by (pre-)standardisation
bodies such as 3GPP and ETSI. Selected ISAC use cases are presented from the
European MultiX project including associated potential functional system
requirements. The paper proposes a 6G system architecture that integrates newly
proposed NFs for the purpose of sensing and demonstrates how they are being
used in offering sensing as a service. Protocol stack adaptations for both
control and a newly proposed sensing plane are discussed.
