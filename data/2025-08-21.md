### [1] [A comparative study of some wavelet and sampling operators on various features of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14043)
*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究SK算子的逼近性质，验证FTA，并比较不同算子在图像分析中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SK算子及其收敛性质，以验证基本逼近定理（FTA）并评估不同算子在图像分析中的适用性。

Method: 使用采样Kantorovich（SK）、高斯、双边和基于阈值的小波算子，分析局部和全局逼近性质，并测量误差及其他数学参数（如MSE、SI、SSI、SMPI、ENL）。

Result: 通过数值示例验证FTA，并展示不同算子在非理想条件下的表现差异。

Conclusion: 不同的算子因其特性在图像分析中各有优劣，适用于不同的图像特征。

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

### [2] [Federated Action Recognition for Smart Worker Assistance Using FastPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14113)
*Vinit Hegiste,Vidit Goyal,Tatjana Legler,Martin Ruskowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于联邦学习的姿态识别框架，在保护隐私的同时显著提高了工业场景中的动作识别准确性和跨用户泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在隐私敏感的工业场景中，集中式数据集不实用，需要一种既能保护隐私又能提高识别准确性的方法。

Method: 使用自定义骨骼数据集，通过修改的FastPose模型处理，训练并评估LSTM和Transformer编码器在四种范式下的表现。

Result: FL Transformer在全局测试集上比集中式训练提高了12.4个百分点，FedEnsemble提高了16.3个百分点；在未见过的外部客户端上，FL和FedEnsemble分别比集中式准确率提高了52.6和58.3个百分点。

Conclusion: FL框架不仅保护隐私，还显著提高了跨用户泛化能力，是异构工业环境中可扩展、隐私感知的HAR实用解决方案。

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

### [3] [LENS: Learning to Segment Anything with Unified Reinforced Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14153)
*Lianghui Zhu,Bin Ouyang,Yuxuan Zhang,Tianheng Cheng,Rui Hu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Xiaoxin Chen,Li Yu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LENS通过强化学习优化链式推理和分割任务，显著提升文本提示分割性能，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在测试时忽略显式的链式推理（CoT），限制了模型对未见提示和领域的泛化能力。

Method: 引入LENS，一个可扩展的强化学习框架，联合优化推理过程和分割任务，并提出统一的强化学习奖励机制，涵盖句子、框和分割级别的线索。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg基准测试中，LENS平均cIoU达到81.2%，优于GLaMM方法5.6%。

Conclusion: LENS框架通过强化学习驱动的链式推理（CoT）显著提升了文本提示图像分割的性能，为更通用的Segment Anything模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEC通过提升局部尺度等变性，有效解决了计算机视觉中的尺度变化问题，显著提高了多个预训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中尺度变化的根本挑战，即同一类别的物体可能具有不同的大小，且其感知大小还受相机距离的影响。

Method: 提出了一种深度平衡规范化器（DEC），用于提升模型的局部尺度等变性。DEC可以轻松集成到现有网络架构中，并适应预训练模型。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，DEC显著提升了ViT、DeiT、Swin和BEiT等四个预训练深度网络的性能和局部尺度一致性。

Conclusion: DEC方法能有效提升模型的局部尺度等变性，并在ImageNet基准测试中显著提高了四个流行预训练深度网络的性能和局部尺度一致性。

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing
fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise
interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an
egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for
evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will
advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents
and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model
checkpoints, and benchmark are available at:

### [6] [CLIPSym: Delving into Symmetry Detection with CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14197)
*Tinghan Yang,Md Ashiqur Rahman,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPSym利用CLIP模型和旋转等变解码器，结合SAPG技术，显著提升了对称性检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）中的对称性线索来改进对称性检测。

Method: CLIPSym结合了CLIP的图像和语言编码器，以及基于Transformer和$G$-卷积的旋转等变解码器，并提出了语义感知提示分组（SAPG）技术。

Result: 在三个标准对称性检测数据集（DENDI、SDRW和LDRS）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLIPSym通过结合CLIP的预训练模型、旋转等变解码器和SAPG技术，在对称性检测任务上表现优异，优于当前最先进的方法。

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at
https://github.com/timyoung2333/CLIPSym.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer
vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep
learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains
fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a
comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature
across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as

three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and
environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design
considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and
limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields,
we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both
theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This
survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also
drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection,
including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to
real-world deployment.

### [8] [Accelerating Image Classification with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks using Voronoi Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14218)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合GCNs和Voronoi图的图像分类框架NVGCN，显著提升了分类效率和准确性，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构和细粒度分类场景时存在局限，本研究旨在通过图卷积网络和Voronoi图的结合，提升图像分类的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用基于图的图像表示方法，将像素或区域视为图的顶点，并通过Delaunay三角剖分简化处理，结合创新的归一化Voronoi图卷积网络（NVGCN）进行图像分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，所提出的NVGCN模型在预处理时间和分类准确性上均优于现有最先进模型，尤其在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 本研究通过将图卷积网络（GCNs）与Voronoi图结合，提出了一种新颖的图像分类框架NVGCN，显著提升了预处理时间和分类准确性，为计算机视觉领域开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过解决混排问题来改进大型多模态模型稳健对齐的方法，包括新任务和损失函数，显著提升了性能并在多个基准测试中达到最佳水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在多种理解任务中表现出色，但在稳健性和泛化能力方面仍存在根本性限制，主要源于视觉和文本特征的对齐和相关性不足。

Method: 论文提出了一种简单但高效的学习机制，通过解决混排问题来改进视觉和文本模态之间的稳健对齐。具体包括两个新任务：重建图像顺序和文本顺序，以及一种新的定向令牌方法来捕捉视觉和文本知识。此外，还引入了图像到响应引导损失来进一步提升LMM的视觉理解能力。

Result: 所提出的方法在学术任务导向和指令跟随的LMM基准测试中，相比之前的LMMs，始终达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过引入新的任务和损失函数，显著提升了大型多模态模型（LMMs）在稳健对齐和跨模态理解方面的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

TL;DR: 研究表明，Mixup和CutMix等数据增强策略能提升DR分级模型的准确性和不确定性估计可靠性，而CLAHE可能降低模型确定性，强调需在增强策略设计时考虑不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）分级等高风险任务中的临床部署需要可证明的可靠性，但现有模型缺乏稳健的不确定性量化。

Method: 使用DDR数据集，评估了两种骨干架构（ResNet-50和CoaT）在五种数据增强策略下的表现，包括无增强、标准几何变换、CLAHE、Mixup和CutMix。

Result: 样本混合策略（如Mixup和CutMix）不仅提高了预测准确性，还产生了更可靠和高效的不确定性估计，而CLAHE等方法可能对模型确定性产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调，在设计数据增强策略时需考虑下游不确定性量化，以构建真正可信的医学影像AI系统。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

Motivation: 满足AI队友、可控NPC、个性化直播助手等新兴需求，要求模型仅依赖玩家可见的像素流并最小化游戏特定工程。

Method: 使用行为克隆和未标记公共视频数据训练模型，通过逆动力学模型推断动作，采用解码器自回归变换器处理大动作空间。

Result: 模型在简单Roblox和经典MS-DOS游戏中表现出色，未标记数据消融实验展示了其潜力。

Conclusion: P2P0.1展示了通过行为克隆和未标记视频数据训练的模型能够在多种3D游戏中表现出类人行为，未来通过扩展和评估有望实现专家级控制。

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的IoU-based损失函数在小物体检测中由于梯度更新不足而表现不佳，因此需要一种能够有效利用物体间空间关系的方法来提升检测性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于类间空间关系的损失函数，通过惩罚小物体预测框不在其相关大物体内部的情况，来优化梯度更新。

Result: 提出的ICR损失在YOLOv12-T和UAV-DETR上分别实现了10.3%和1.6%的mAP提升，且无需额外调参。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的类间关系损失函数（ICR），通过利用物体间的空间关系，有效提升了小物体的检测性能，并在多个模型上实现了显著的mAP提升。

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

Conclusion: 本研究通过公开数据集和基线模型ResAttention-KNN，为基于视觉的生物医学分析提供了可复现的工具，支持未来研究。

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

Conclusion: HRC-Pose通过对比学习成功学习了连续特征空间，并在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中优于现有深度方法，展示了其在真实世界应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的方法，通过分离音频成分和量化视频为视觉标记，结合情感锚（EA）表示，成功实现了情感可控的说话人脸生成。实验证明该方法在质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的广义跟踪框架在多种对象类型上表现出色，特别是在复杂交通场景中的车辆跟踪。通过结合遮挡感知的重新识别机制和道路结构感知的轨迹优化策略，显著提升了轨迹的连续性和准确性。

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

Conclusion: QuadINR通过使用分段二次激活函数，显著降低了硬件开销，同时提升了性能，验证了其在图像和视频处理中的优越表现。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net提出了一种高效、并行的高分辨率空间转录组数据预测框架，为下一代空间转录组建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

Conclusion: 通过结合残差向量量化（RVQ）的连续运动特征，提出的方法在保持姿态代码可解释性和可操作性的同时，有效捕捉了细微运动特征，显著提升了文本到运动的生成质量。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Flux模型在处理非英语提示时的性能不足问题，特别是由于英语中心训练数据集带来的语言和文化偏见。

Method: 利用MultiModal Diffusion Transformer（MMDiT）直接控制Flux主干，减少参数数量并增强对中文语义的理解。

Result: CTA-Flux支持中英文提示，在图像生成质量、视觉真实性和中文语义的忠实描绘方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CTA-Flux通过MMDiT技术有效提升了Flux模型对中文语义的理解能力，显著提高了生成图像的质量和文化真实性，同时保持了与现有插件的兼容性。

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出融合单目RGB图像和AIS数据的技术，生成船舶6D姿态估计数据集，验证了PnP方法和YOLOX-X模型的优越性，并公开了BONK-pose数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的AIS数据在位置信息上存在设备可靠性、数据操纵和传输延迟等问题，限制了其单独使用的效果。因此，论文提出融合单目RGB图像和AIS数据，以克服这些限制并生成更准确的6D姿态估计数据集。

Method: 论文通过结合YOLOX-X模型检测的单目RGB图像中的船舶与AIS数据，生成表示船舶6D姿态的3D边界框。评估了不同的目标检测模型和两种转换方法（单应性和PnP）的性能。

Result: 结果表明，PnP方法的投影误差显著低于单应性方法，YOLOX-X模型在相关船舶类别上的mAP达到0.80（IoU阈值为0.5）。论文还展示了无需手动标注即可创建6D姿态估计数据集的潜力，并公开了BONK-pose数据集。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合单目RGB图像和AIS数据的新技术，用于生成船舶的6D姿态估计数据集，并验证了PnP方法在投影误差上的优越性以及YOLOX-X模型的高精度。此外，论文还公开了BONK-pose数据集，为6D姿态估计网络的训练和评估提供了资源。

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PB-IAD是一种基于提示的工业异常检测框架，利用基础模型的能力，在数据稀疏和动态生产环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测的标准方法依赖于大量标注数据且缺乏灵活性，而基础模型的感知能力为这一任务提供了新的可能性。

Method: PB-IAD框架结合了针对动态生产环境设计的提示模板和预处理模块，允许领域专家无需数据科学知识即可灵活定制系统。

Result: 在三种制造场景和两种数据模态下的评估显示，PB-IAD在数据稀疏和低样本设置中优于现有方法（如PatchCore）。

Conclusion: PB-IAD框架通过利用基础模型的多模态和推理能力，在数据稀疏和低样本设置下表现出卓越的性能，为工业异常检测提供了灵活且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

*Jeahun Sung,Changhyun Roh,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCHA-former提出了一种新型去摩尔纹方法，通过DMAD和STAD组件解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个指标上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便携式成像设备的普及导致相机拍摄屏幕时因CFA与子像素间的频率混叠产生摩尔纹，严重影响画质。现有去摩尔纹方法在空间变化、大尺度结构、通道依赖和时序波动等方面仍存在不足。

Method: MoCHA-former包含Decoupled Moiré Adaptive Demoiréing (DMAD)和Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoiréing (STAD)两个关键组件。DMAD通过Moiré Decoupling Block (MDB)和Detail Decoupling Block (DDB)分离摩尔纹与内容，再通过Moiré Conditioning Block (MCB)生成自适应特征进行针对性修复。STAD引入Spatial Fusion Block (SFB)和Feature Channel Attention (FCA)分别处理大尺度结构和通道依赖。此外，MoCHA-former通过隐式帧对齐确保时序一致性。

Result: MoCHA-former在RAW和sRGB视频数据集上的PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCHA-former通过DMAD和STAD两个核心组件，有效解决了去摩尔纹任务中的空间变化、大尺度结构、通道依赖和时序波动等问题，并在RAW和sRGB视频数据集上均超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

Conclusion: HyperDiff通过结合扩散模型和HyperGCN，有效解决了单目3D人体姿态估计中的深度模糊和遮挡问题，并在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型适应方法在平衡知识保留与领域适应之间的挑战，避免因适应领域变化而导致任务相关知识的遗忘。

Method: 提出FOCUS方法，利用训练轻量级的Y-FPN网络分离高低频信息，结合FrequencyMix数据增强方法，在扩散驱动的输入适应框架中实现频率条件化。

Result: 在15种损坏类型和三个数据集上，FOCUS在语义分割和单目深度估计任务中实现了最先进的平均性能，并能通过伪标签补充现有模型适应方法。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过频率驱动的条件化方法，在扩散驱动的去噪过程中有效保留了任务相关的语义信息，显著提升了模型在多种损坏类型下的性能，并减轻了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

Motivation: 点云视频的时空无序性阻碍了SSMs在序列建模中的直接应用，需解决时空建模的挑战。

Method: 提出UST-SSM模型，包含STSS（通过提示引导聚类重组无序点）、STSA（聚合时空特征补偿缺失细节）和TIS（增强时序依赖）。

Conclusion: UST-SSM通过STSS、STSA和TIS模块有效解决了点云视频时空无序问题，提升了动作识别性能，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is
available at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.

Conclusion: MUSE框架通过CCA机制和两阶段训练策略，显著提升了多主体合成任务的空间精确性和身份一致性，推动了可控图像合成的前沿发展。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: NIRSplat在具有挑战性的农业场景中表现出色，优于现有的3DGS、CoR-GS和InstantSplat等方法，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,
highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code

Conclusion: MF-LPR$^2$ 通过多帧对齐与聚合显著提升了低质量车牌图像的恢复与识别准确率，同时保持了证据内容的完整性。

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

Conclusion: DAPA框架通过引入领域提示机制和并行交叉注意力模块，显著提升了跨文化和跨语言基准测试中的参与度估计性能，并在MultiMediate'25挑战赛中取得了第一名。

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at
MultiMediate'25.

Conclusion: 在测试时操作于紧凑的基础特征空间提供了一个无需额外训练的实用且通用的临床注册解决方案。

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

TL;DR: TransLight通过生成解耦和扩散模型实现了高保真光效转移，解决了现有方法在定制化控制和内容完整性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照编辑方法难以同时提供定制化的光效控制和保持内容完整性，尤其是在将复杂光效从参考图像转移到目标图像的挑战性任务中表现不佳。

Method: 该方法首先提出生成解耦，利用两个微调的扩散模型精确分离图像内容和光效，生成了一个百万级规模的图像-内容-光效三元组数据集。随后，采用IC-Light作为生成模型，并以三元组训练模型，将参考光照图像作为额外条件信号注入。

Result: 实验结果表明，TransLight是首个成功在不同图像间转移光效的方法，提供了比现有技术更定制化的光照控制。

Conclusion: TransLight通过创新的生成解耦策略，成功实现了跨图像的高保真和高自由度光效转移，为光照和谐化与编辑研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

Motivation: 现有方法独立处理前向和逆向渲染，导致循环不一致和推理速度慢，需要一种更高效且一致的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Ouroboros框架，包含两个单步扩散模型，通过循环一致性机制确保前向和逆向渲染输出的一致性，并扩展了室内外场景的本征分解。

Result: 实验结果表明，Ouroboros在多样场景中达到最先进性能，推理速度显著快于其他基于扩散的方法，且能无训练迁移到视频分解。

Conclusion: Ouroboros框架通过两个单步扩散模型相互强化，实现了前向和逆向渲染的循环一致性，显著提升了推理速度，并在视频分解中展示了无需训练的迁移能力。

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Motivation: 随着视频生成的快速发展，定制化视频编辑需求激增，其中主题替换是关键但尚未充分探索的领域。现有方法要么局限于狭窄领域，要么依赖间接编辑范式或模糊文本提示，影响最终保真度。

Method: 提出了一个基于掩码引导、主题无关的端到端框架DreamSwapV，通过用户指定的掩码和参考图像实现视频中任意主题的替换。该方法引入了多条件输入和专用的条件融合模块，并设计了自适应掩码策略以适应不同尺度和属性的主题。

Conclusion: DreamSwapV通过精心设计的两阶段数据集构建和训练方案，在VBench指标和新引入的DreamSwapV-Benchmark上验证了其优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Motivation: 预测未来无碰撞轨迹的能力在类人机器人、VR/AR和辅助导航等应用中至关重要。本文旨在解决从第一人称视频中预测未来6D头部姿态序列的挑战性问题。

Method: 提出了一个框架，该框架基于时间聚合的3D潜在特征进行推理，建模了环境和动态部分的几何和语义约束。

Conclusion: 研究表明，该模型能够学习人类类似的导航行为，如等待/减速、重新规划路线以及环顾交通情况，并在未见过的环境中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing
down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen
environments. Check out our project webpage at

Motivation: 传统的可控管线微调常因多模态对齐不完美导致分布漂移，影响纹理真实感和时间一致性。

Method: 提出了一种概念蒸馏训练策略，利用预训练的T2V模型合成带有嵌入文本概念的训练样本，并重新设计了控制架构，包括控制特征投影器和双分支设计的ControlNet连接器。

Result: Vivid-VR在纹理真实感、视觉生动性和时间一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Vivid-VR在合成和真实世界基准测试以及AIGC视频上表现优异，实现了令人印象深刻的纹理真实感、视觉生动性和时间一致性。代码和检查点已公开。

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

TL;DR: SATURN通过轻量级扩展VAR-CLIP，将场景图转换为token序列，显著提升文本到图像生成的质量，无需额外模块或多阶段训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在捕捉复杂提示的布局和对象关系方面存在困难，而场景图提供了一种自然的结构先验。

Method: SATURN是一种轻量级扩展，通过将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，使冻结的CLIP-VQ-VAE主干能够解释图结构，同时仅微调VAR变换器。

Result: 在Visual Genome数据集上，SATURN将FID从56.45%降至21.62%，Inception Score从16.03提升至24.78，优于SG2IM和SGDiff等方法。

Conclusion: SATURN有效结合了结构意识与最先进的自回归保真度，显著提升了文本到图像生成的质量。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art
autoregressive fidelity.

Method: 提出ScenGE框架，结合元场景生成和复杂场景演化，利用大型语言模型推断对抗性行为并优化代理轨迹。

Result: ScenGE在多个基于强化学习的AV模型上平均发现比现有基线更严重的碰撞案例（+31.96%），并能提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ScenGE框架通过生成多样化的安全关键场景，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的安全评估能力，并通过真实车辆测试和人类评估验证了其生成的场景既合理又关键。

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

Motivation: 全切片图像（WSIs）在计算病理学中由于千兆像素规模导致极高的计算成本，预处理和训练时间可能长达数天或数周，成为实际部署中的主要瓶颈。

Method: WISE-FUSE 利用病理领域视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过选择性处理诊断相关区域来减少计算负担。首先计算低分辨率补丁与类特定文本描述的相似性分数，然后选择信息丰富的区域进行高分辨率编码和文本嵌入融合。

Result: 实验表明，WISE-FUSE 将 WSI 编码时间减少了三倍以上，同时实现了与详尽补丁处理相当或更好的诊断性能。

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE 提供了一个可扩展且实用的解决方案，显著减少了计算病理学中全切片图像的编码时间，同时保持或超越了详尽处理的诊断性能。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

Motivation: 当前OCR系统在低质量数据识别上存在困难，尤其是在印刷文档中，域内数据变异性低而域间变异性高。现有方法未能充分利用文档的冗余性。

Method: 引入了一种扩展的高斯混合模型（GMM），通过交替使用期望最大化（EM）算法和簇内重新对齐过程以及正态性统计测试。

Result: 在包括乌拉圭军事档案和17世纪至20世纪中叶欧洲报纸在内的多种退化程度文档中均实现了改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种无监督方法，通过利用文档内字符形状的冗余性来纠正给定OCR系统的不完美输出，并提出更好的聚类方法。该方法在具有不同退化程度的文档中均表现出改进效果。

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of
high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve
cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel

present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于获取密集概念注释的成本高昂，现有的无标签CBM方法在概念定位上存在不足。

Method: 利用基础模型提供的信息，采用原型学习方法，为每个概念分配一个原型，并通过鼓励原型编码相似的局部区域来学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，LCBM能有效识别图像中的概念，并改善了定位性能。

Conclusion: LCBM通过原型学习有效提升了概念的空间定位准确性，同时保持了分类性能。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

TL;DR: GOGS是一种基于2D高斯surfels的两阶段框架，解决了高光物体逆渲染中的模糊性和材料分解问题，实现了高性能的几何重建和重光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光物体逆渲染存在固有模糊性，现有方法（如NeRF和3D高斯泼溅）在计算成本或高光反射下表现不佳。多视图不一致性导致高频表面噪声和结构伪影，简化渲染方程则掩盖材料属性，影响重光照效果。

Method: 提出了一种基于2D高斯surfels的两阶段框架：第一阶段通过基于物理的渲染和分割求和近似建立稳健的表面重建；第二阶段利用蒙特卡洛重要性采样进行材料分解，并通过可微的2D高斯光线追踪和球形mipmap方向编码细化高光细节。

Result: 实验表明，GOGS在几何重建、材料分离和照片级真实感重光照方面优于现有逆渲染方法。

Conclusion: GOGS通过两阶段框架有效解决了高光物体逆渲染中的多视图不一致性和材料分解问题，实现了在几何重建、材料分离和新照明条件下的照片级真实感重光照方面的最先进性能。

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Abstract: Even though a significant amount of work has been done to increase the safety
of transportation networks, accidents still occur regularly. They must be
understood as an unavoidable and sporadic outcome of traffic networks. We
present the TUM Traffic Accident (TUMTraf-A) dataset, a collection of
real-world highway accidents. It contains ten sequences of vehicle crashes at
high-speed driving with 294,924 labeled 2D and 93,012 labeled 3D boxes and
track IDs within 48,144 labeled frames recorded from four roadside cameras and
LiDARs at 10 Hz. The dataset contains ten object classes and is provided in the
OpenLABEL format. We propose Accid3nD, an accident detection model that
combines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one. Experiments and
ablation studies on our dataset show the robustness of our proposed method. The

TL;DR: HistAug是一种高效的数字病理学潜在空间增强方法，通过可控的补丁级变换提升MIL模型性能，尤其在低数据情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学中的全切片图像（WSI）分析面临高分辨率和稀疏监督信号的挑战。传统的补丁级增强成本高昂，而现有的特征级增强方法缺乏对变换语义的控制。

Method: 通过条件化明确的补丁级变换（如色调、侵蚀），HistAug在潜在空间中生成真实的增强嵌入，同时保留初始语义信息。该方法能够高效地单次前向处理大量补丁。

Result: 实验表明，HistAug在多种切片级任务和不同器官上优于现有方法，特别是在低数据情况下。消融研究证实了学习变换优于基于噪声的扰动，并强调了均匀WSI级增强的重要性。

Conclusion: HistAug是一种高效且可控的生成模型，能够在数字病理学中实现潜在空间的数据增强，显著提升MIL模型的性能，尤其在数据稀缺的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于光流和Transformer的两阶段不确定性感知烟雾检测框架，显著提升了早期火灾检测的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火灾爆发对人类生命和基础设施构成严重威胁，需要高保真的早期预警系统检测烟雾等燃烧前兆。然而，烟雾羽流受光照变化、流动运动学和环境噪声影响，传统检测器可靠性不足。

Method: 通过整合单目图像中的烟雾特征表示，提出了一种基于光流运动编码和双相水平集分数阶变分模型的光流估计方法，并结合高斯混合模型生成烟雾区域的二值分割掩码。这些融合表示被输入到增强多尺度不确定性估计头的Shifted-Windows Transformer中，并通过两阶段学习方案进行训练。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的两阶段不确定性感知Shifted Windows Transformer框架在烟雾检测中表现出卓越的泛化性和鲁棒性，为早期火灾检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

Motivation: 探索视觉提示方法在增量目标检测中的通用性，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 分析了三种提示方法在复杂域增量学习场景下的表现，并提供了多种基线对比。

Result: 视觉提示方法在IOD中表现不佳，但结合少量数据回放的方法效果最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为推进IOD中的提示方法提供了有价值的见解，尤其强调了数据回放的重要性。

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管 SNN 在低功耗计算方面具有潜力，但在复杂时序任务（如多目标跟踪）中的应用尚未充分探索，尤其是在传统 RGB 视频流中。

Method: SMTrack 引入了自适应和尺度感知的归一化 Wasserstein 距离损失（Asa-NWDLoss）来提升检测和定位性能，并采用 TrackTrack 身份模块以保持轨迹一致性。

Result: 在 BEE24、MOT17、MOT20 和 DanceTrack 数据集上的广泛评估表明，SMTrack 性能与 ANN 方法相当。

Conclusion: SMTrack 是一种直接在标准 RGB 视频上端到端训练的深度 SNN 框架，其性能与领先的 ANN 方法相当，推动了复杂场景中 SNN 跟踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

Method: 提出AnchorSync，一种基于扩散的框架，将长视频编辑任务分解为稀疏关键帧编辑和平滑中间帧插值，通过渐进式去噪和多模态引导保持结构一致性和时间动态。

Result: 实验表明，AnchorSync能生成连贯、高保真的编辑结果，在视觉质量和时间稳定性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AnchorSync通过解耦关键帧编辑和中间帧插值，结合渐进式去噪和多模态引导，显著提升了长视频编辑的质量和时间稳定性，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.

Motivation: 解决密集视觉场景中由于遮挡、背景杂乱和尺度变化带来的分割挑战。

Method: PerSense++引入了三个增强组件：(i) 多样性感知的示例选择策略，(ii) 结合轮廓和峰值提示生成的混合IDM，(iii) 通过异常分析丢弃空间不一致掩码的IMRM。

Conclusion: PerSense++在密集场景中表现出色，优于现有方法，并提出了专门用于密集图像个性化分割的基准PerSense-D。

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

*Gopi Raju Matta,Trisha Reddypalli,Vemunuri Divya Madhuri,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeMS是一个3D高斯溅射框架，直接从极端模糊图像中重建场景，整合了深度学习运动结构、概率分布初始化及联合优化。GeMS-E通过事件驱动细化进一步提升效果。两者在合成和真实数据上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去模糊方法（如ExBluRF和Deblur-GS）通常假设可以访问清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，这在现实中不切实际。依赖COLMAP初始化的方法（如BAD-Gaussians）也因严重模糊下的不可靠特征对应而失败。GeMS旨在直接从极端模糊图像中重建场景。

Method: GeMS框架整合了VGGSfM（基于深度学习的运动结构管道）、3DGS-MCMC（将高斯视为概率分布样本以消除启发式密集化和修剪）以及相机轨迹和高斯参数的联合优化。GeMS-E进一步引入了事件驱动的渐进细化步骤（EDI去模糊）。

Result: GeMS和GeMS-E在合成和真实数据集上均取得了最先进的性能，首次直接从严重模糊的输入中解决了3D高斯溅射中的极端运动模糊问题。

Conclusion: GeMS和GeMS-E框架在合成和真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能，首次直接从严重模糊的输入中解决了3D高斯溅射中的极端运动模糊问题。

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

TL;DR: 提出模型驱动方法，通过联合知识转移和保存构建通用视觉基础模型，无需大量标记数据，实验证明在多个视觉任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型（VFMs）主要依赖数据为中心的方法，需要大量高质量标记数据和高端GPU资源，这对大多数机构构成瓶颈。而现有的开源视觉模型在特定领域数据上预训练，具有跨领域应用的知识转移潜力，但尚未被充分探索用于开发通用VFM。

Method: 提出了一种新的模型驱动方法，通过统一多个预训练教师模型在共享潜在空间中来缓解分布差异导致的“不平衡转移”问题，并引入知识保存策略，通过适配器模块整合通用和专业教师模型的知识。

Result: 实验表明，我们的VFM在图像分类、目标检测、语义和实例分割四个基础视觉任务上优于现有数据为中心模型。

Conclusion: 通过联合知识转移和保存的方法，我们构建了一个强大的视觉基础模型（VFM），能够在不依赖大量标记数据的情况下继承教师的专业知识，并在多个下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

Motivation: 解决3D高斯飞溅在极端新视角或部分观察区域生成高质量渲染的挑战，以及扩散模型在依赖文本提示和缺乏特定场景信息的情况下难以准确完成3D重建任务的问题。

Method: 引入GSFix3D框架，通过从扩散模型中提取先验知识到3D表示中，提升视觉保真度，同时保持与观察到的场景细节的一致性。核心是GSFixer，一种通过定制微调协议获得的潜在扩散模型，能够利用网格和3D高斯来适应不同环境和重建方法的伪影类型。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中，GSFix3D和GSFixer实现了最先进的性能，且对潜在姿态错误具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSFix3D和GSFixer在挑战性基准测试中表现出色，仅需对捕获数据进行最小限度的场景特定微调，即可实现最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种轻量级神经网络方法，用于光照和传感器映射，其性能优于现有方法，并在神经ISP的下游任务中展示了实用性。

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

Motivation: 解决高速度物体运动时传统相机因帧率限制和运动模糊导致的姿态跟踪难题。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证了方法的有效性，特别是在高速度运动场景下。

Conclusion: 通过结合事件相机和RGB相机的优势，提出的方法在高速度运动场景下有效跟踪物体的6-DoF姿态。

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Conclusion: 本研究通过构建量化PFMs中领域偏见的流程，提出了一种轻量级的对抗框架，有效减少了医院特异性特征，同时保持或提升了疾病分类性能，特别是在未见医院的场景中。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

TL;DR: Tinker是一个无需每场景微调的高保真3D编辑框架，通过预训练扩散模型的潜在3D感知能力，实现从少量图像中生成多视图一致的编辑，显著降低了3D内容创作的门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有技术需要大量每场景优化或一致编辑输入视图的问题，Tinker旨在从少量图像中实现多视图一致的编辑，无需每场景微调。

Method: Tinker框架包含两个新颖组件：1) 参考多视图编辑器，实现跨所有视角的精确、参考驱动的编辑；2) 任意视图到视频合成器，利用视频扩散的空间-时间先验，从稀疏输入中完成高质量场景补全和新视图生成。

Result: Tinker在编辑、新视图合成和渲染增强任务上实现了最先进的性能，并通过广泛实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Tinker代表了向真正可扩展的零样本3D编辑迈出的关键一步，显著降低了通用3D内容创作的门槛。

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

TL;DR: 提出一种新框架，通过细粒度特征学习和推理流程优化视频-语言检索性能，无需额外预训练，实验证明其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频流量的爆炸式增长对视频-语言检索的准确性和训练成本提出了挑战，现有方法依赖大规模预训练，计算成本高，且未充分探索视频和文本的细粒度信息。

Method: 采用粗到细的目标学习视频-文本对的语义信息，包括对比学习和匹配学习，并通过粒度感知表示模块获取细粒度训练数据。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和DiDeMo数据集上，推理流程分别实现了2.1%和1.6%的Recall@1提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在四个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，推理流程显著提升了检索性能，无需额外预训练。

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

Motivation: 传统帧相机在道路分割中存在延迟和计算资源消耗高的问题，事件相机因其低功耗感知成为有前景的替代方案。

Method: EventSSEG采用基于事件的自我监督学习和概率注意力机制，仅使用事件数据进行道路分割。

Result: 在DSEC-Semantic和DDD17数据集上的实验表明，EventSSEG仅需少量标注事件即可达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EventSSEG通过事件相机的自监督学习方法，有效解决了道路分割中标注数据稀缺的问题，并实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了生命周期的胰腺形态趋势，表明2型糖尿病患者的胰腺大小和形状发生了改变。研究还发现，2型糖尿病患者的胰腺较小，并贡献了一个来自大型非糖尿病对照患者群体的临床参考数据集。

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

TL;DR: MS-CLR通过多骨架对比学习提升骨架动作识别的泛化能力，在NTU数据集上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法依赖单一骨架结构，难以泛化到不同关节结构和解剖覆盖的数据集。

Method: 提出Multi-Skeleton Contrastive Learning (MS-CLR)框架，通过统一表示方案适配ST-GCN架构，处理不同骨架结构和尺度。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60和120数据集上，MS-CLR性能优于单骨架对比学习方法，多骨架集成进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: MS-CLR通过多骨架对比学习框架，显著提升了骨架动作识别的性能，并在NTU RGB+D数据集上达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种统一的表示方法，通过联合建模几何和运动，显著提高了复杂多部分关节物体的重建精度和运动估计能力，并在下游任务中展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试无法全面评估LLM生成的生产级软件，缺乏对交互行为和运行时动态的捕捉。

Method: 提出RealDevWorld框架，包含RealDevBench（多样化软件工程任务集）和AppEvalPilot（基于GUI交互的评估系统）。

Result: RealDevWorld在自动评估中达到0.92的准确率和0.85的人类评估相关性，显著减少人工审核需求。

Conclusion: RealDevWorld框架通过引入RealDevBench和AppEvalPilot，有效填补了当前评估LLM生成生产级软件能力的空白，实现了自动化、精细化的评估，并与人类专家评估高度一致。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents in software development are
rapidly evolving from generating isolated code snippets to producing
full-fledged software applications with graphical interfaces, interactive
logic, and dynamic behaviors. However, current benchmarks fall short in
evaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks
or binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and
runtime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge
when an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current
evaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact
with it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce
RealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment
of LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It
features two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194
open-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating
multimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a
new agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user
interactions to automatically and holistically assess software functional
correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers
fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation
beyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that
RealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations,
achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human
assessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review. This
enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software
generated by LLMs. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Specifications for code writing tasks are usually expressed in natural
language and may be ambiguous. Programmers must therefore develop the ability
to recognize ambiguities in task specifications and resolve them by asking
clarifying questions. We present and evaluate a prototype system, based on a
novel technique (ARHF: Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback), that (1)
suggests specific inputs on which a given task specification may be ambiguous,
(2) seeks limited human feedback about the code's desired behavior on those
inputs, and (3) uses this feedback to generate code that resolves these
ambiguities. We evaluate the efficacy of our prototype, and we discuss the
implications of such assistive systems on Computer Science education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM生成代码的稳定性对于判断其在现实开发中的可靠性至关重要，现有指标如pass@k、BLEU或CodeBLEU存在局限性。

Method: 通过将结构熵概念扩展到程序领域，结合AST分析，收集深度受限子树的相对频率作为概率分布，并使用Jensen-Shannon散度和结构交叉熵比来测量稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够揭示模型一致性和鲁棒性的细微差别，且运行时间为O(n,d)，无需外部测试。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于AST和结构熵的轻量级方法，用于评估LLM生成代码的稳定性，该方法无需外部测试且语言无关。

Abstract: Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs)
is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend
prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy
with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the
multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat
their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure
stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a
symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural
Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both
metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views
on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or
CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and
execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code
generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals
nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time
with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation
evaluation toolkit.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation, achieving high scores on benchmarks such as HumanEval and
MBPP. However, these benchmarks primarily assess functional correctness and
neglect broader dimensions of code quality, including security, reliability,
readability, and maintainability. In this work, we systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate high-quality code across multiple dimensions using
the PythonSecurityEval benchmark. We introduce an iterative static
analysis-driven prompting algorithm that leverages Bandit and Pylint to
identify and resolve code quality issues. Our experiments with GPT-4o show
substantial improvements: security issues reduced from >40% to 13%, readability
violations from >80% to 11%, and reliability warnings from >50% to 11% within
ten iterations. These results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by static
analysis feedback, can significantly enhance code quality beyond functional
correctness.

operational metrics such as resource utilization, ingestion throughput,

building sustainable environmental data platforms. By open-sourcing the

Conclusion: 新提出的结构模式通过概念和同步机制提高了软件的易读性和模块化，适用于LLM生成代码的场景。

Abstract: The opportunities offered by LLM coders (and their current limitations)
demand a reevaluation of how software is structured. Software today is often
"illegible" - lacking a direct correspondence between code and observed
behavior - and insufficiently modular, leading to a failure of three key
requirements of robust coding: incrementality (the ability to deliver small
increments by making localized changes), integrity (avoiding breaking prior
increments) and transparency (making clear what has changed at build time, and
what actions have happened at runtime).
  A new structural pattern offers improved legibility and modularity. Its
elements are concepts and synchronizations: fully independent services and
event-based rules that mediate between them. A domain-specific language for
synchronizations allows behavioral features to be expressed in a granular and
declarative way (and thus readily generated by an LLM). A case study of the
RealWorld benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the approach.

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is
arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have
recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in
formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to
deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to context-length
limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex,
interprocedural specifications. This paper outlines Preguss - a modular,
fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal
specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive
verification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error
(RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii)
LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We
envisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated
verification of large-scale programs.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays
remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is
especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems.
Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can
possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease
this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in
conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.
These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface
information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to
understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.
Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based
Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated
explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if
developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our
demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely
accessible to all users.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种利用LLMs自动生成问答系统组件解释的方法，实验证明其效果优于传统模板方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决基于AI的问答系统中组件行为和决策难以解释的问题，尤其是对于使用RDF和SPARQL的复杂系统。

Method: 论文提出的方法是通过分析组件的输入（SPARQL查询）和输出（RDF三元组）数据流，利用模板或LLMs生成解释，帮助用户理解组件的行为和决策。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于LLMs生成的解释在用户评分中质量更高，多数情况下优于模板方法。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，通过使用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动生成解释，能够有效提升问答（QA）组件行为和决策的可解释性，且优于基于模板的方法。

Abstract: Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it
difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made
by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based
systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes
driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly
explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed
process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an
approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source
for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components,
enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the
data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF
triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on
verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach
generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or
via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations
(automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated
via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches
according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically
explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF
and SPARQL as a context for explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态系统在机器学习推动下日益普及，但缺乏适合多模态交互特性的需求规范语言和方法，导致AI增强系统可能无法满足用户需求。

Method: 提出了MERLAN的元模型和基于ANTLR的文法实现，开发了原型工具以支持需求编写和系统实现生成。

Result: MERLAN DSL及其工具链能够有效支持多模态界面的需求规范和系统实现。

Conclusion: MERLAN作为一种领域特定语言（DSL），为多模态界面的需求规范提供了有效工具，通过原型工具支持需求工程师编写需求并自动生成符合需求的系统实现。

Abstract: Multimodal systems, which process multiple input types such as text, audio,
and images, are becoming increasingly prevalent in software systems, enabled by
the huge advancements in Machine Learning. This triggers the need to easily
define the requirements linked to these new types of user interactions,
potentially involving more than one modality at the same time. This remains an
open challenge due to the lack of languages and methods adapted to the diverse
nature of multimodal interactions, with the risk of implementing AI-enhanced
systems that do not properly satisfy the user needs.
  In this sense, this paper presents MERLAN, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
to specify the requirements for these new types of multimodal interfaces. We
present the metamodel for such language together with a textual syntax
implemented as an ANTLR grammar. A prototype tool enabling requirements
engineers to write such requirements and automatically generate a possible
implementation of a system compliant with them on top of an agentic framework
is also provided.

TL;DR: 研究通过静态分析发现五种LLM生成的Java代码普遍存在缺陷，强调验证和静态分析的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM生成的代码质量和安全性，揭示其在生成代码时的系统性缺陷，强调静态分析的重要性。

Method: 通过SonarQube对4,442个Java编程作业进行全面的静态分析，评估了五种大型语言模型的代码质量和安全性。

Result: 研究发现LLM生成的代码普遍存在软件缺陷，且功能性表现（如Pass@1率）与代码质量和安全性无直接关联。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM可以生成功能性代码，但它们也会引入一系列软件缺陷，包括错误、安全漏洞和代码异味。这些缺陷可能反映了当前LLM代码生成方法的系统性局限。研究结果表明，LLM生成的代码需要经过验证才能被视为生产就绪。静态分析是检测潜在缺陷的重要工具。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and
security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior
research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this
research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through
comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that
although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of
software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared
weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code
generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded
passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple
models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in
order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation
between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit
tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by
the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the
functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is
not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this
study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models
appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the
view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent
defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software
development.

Conclusion: 专家们识别了17个关键挑战及解决方案，强调了资源利用的重要性，并将重点转向未解决的挑战，与更广泛的社区分享下一步行动。

Abstract: Verification and validation of vehicles is a complex yet critical process,
particularly for ensuring safety and coverage through simulations. However,
achieving realistic and useful simulations comes with significant challenges.
To explore these challenges, we conducted a workshop with experts in the field,
allowing them to brainstorm key obstacles. Following this, we distributed a
survey to consolidate findings and gain further insights into potential
solutions. The experts identified 17 key challenges, along with proposed
solutions, an assessment of whether they represent next steps for research, and
the roadblocks to their implementation. While a lack of resources was not
initially highlighted as a major challenge, utilizing more resources emerged as
a critical necessity when experts discussed solutions. Interestingly, we
expected some of these challenges to have already been addressed or to have
systematic solutions readily available, given the collective expertise in the
field. Many of the identified problems already have known solutions, allowing
us to shift focus towards unresolved challenges and share the next steps with
the broader community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在有限视距和局部知识的条件下，如何部署机器人群体以满足特定图属性（如最小顶点覆盖）的需求。

Method: 提出了针对树和一般图的两类算法，分别处理单门和多门情况，并分析了时间复杂度和内存需求。

Result: 建立了机器人视距范围和时间复杂度的下限，提出了时间最优和内存最优的算法，并在特定情况下实现了MinVC。

Conclusion: 本文通过有限视距的发光机器人群体，成功解决了在异步调度器下填充最小顶点覆盖（MVC）的问题，并针对特定图类实现了最小顶点覆盖（MinVC）。

Abstract: In a connected graph with an autonomous robot swarm with limited visibility,
it is natural to ask whether the robots can be deployed to certain vertices
satisfying a given property using only local knowledge. This paper
affirmatively answers the question with a set of \emph{myopic} (finite
visibility range) luminous robots with the aim of \emph{filling a minimal
vertex cover} (MVC) of a given graph $G = (V, E)$. The graph has special
vertices, called \emph{doors}, through which robots enter sequentially.
Starting from the doors, the goal of the robots is to settle on a set of
vertices that forms a minimal vertex cover of $G$ under the asynchronous
($\mathcal{ASYNC}$) scheduler. We are also interested in achieving the
\emph{minimum vertex cover} (MinVC, which is NP-hard \cite{Karp1972} for
general graphs) for a specific graph class using the myopic robots. We
establish lower bounds on the visibility range for the robots and on the time
complexity (which is $\Omega(|E|)$). We present two algorithms for trees: one
for single door, which is both time and memory-optimal, and the other for
multiple doors, which is memory-optimal and achieves time-optimality when the
number of doors is a constant. Interestingly, our technique achieves MinVC on
trees with a single door. We then move to the general graph, where we present
two algorithms, one for the single door and the other for the multiple doors
with an extra memory of $O(\log \Delta)$ for the robots, where $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree of $G$. All our algorithms run in $O(|E|)$ epochs.

Motivation: 旨在为数学和计算提供一个不依赖于逻辑或类型的、以'有限序列'为基础的新的公理化基础。

Method: 开发了一种空间理论，通过研究空间的半环同态来研究空间，并以最小组合定义从纯数据中'有机生长'出空间。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于'纯数据'的数学和计算基础框架，通过'有机生长'的方式展示了经典数学对象的自然涌现，并探讨了理论与探索的新方向。

Abstract: In a previous work, "pure data" is proposed as an axiomatic foundation for
mathematics and computing, based on "finite sequence" as the foundational
concept rather than based on logic or type. Within this framework, objects with
mathematical meaning are "data" and collections of mathematical objects must
then be associative data, called a "space." A space is then the basic
collection in this framework analogous to sets in Set Theory or objects in
Category Theory. A theory of spaces is developed,where spaces are studied via
their semiring of endomorphisms. To illustrate these concepts, and as a way of
exploring the implications of the framework, pure data spaces are "grown
organically" from the substrate of pure data with minimal combinatoric
definitions. Familiar objects from classical mathematics emerge this way,
including natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, boolean spaces, matrix
algebras, Gaussian Integers, Quaternions, and non-associative algebras like the
Integer Octonions. Insights from these examples are discussed with a view
towards new directions in theory and new exploration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图数据规模大且动态变化，现有动态SSSP算法无法同时处理边增删、分布式内存和低延迟查询需求。

Method: 提出SSSP-Del算法，基于共享无架构，采用顶点中心、异步和完全分布式的设计，处理边插入和删除的流式数据。

Result: 在大规模真实和合成图上进行综合评估，验证了SSSP-Del在延迟、稳定性和吞吐量方面的优势。

Conclusion: SSSP-Del算法通过顶点中心、异步和完全分布式的设计，有效解决了动态图中单源最短路径问题的高延迟和不稳定性问题，适用于大规模图处理。

Abstract: Modern graphs are both large and dynamic, presenting significant challenges
for fundamental queries, such as the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
problem. Naively recomputing the SSSP tree after each topology change is
prohibitively expensive, causing on-demand computation to suffer from high
latency. Existing dynamic SSSP algorithms often cannot simultaneously handle
both edge additions and deletions, operate in distributed memory, and provide
low-latency query results. To address these challenges, this paper presents
SSSP-Del, a new vertex-centric, asynchronous, and fully distributed algorithm
for dynamic SSSP. Operating in a shared-nothing architecture, our algorithm
processes streams of both edge insertions and deletions. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation on large real-world and synthetic graphs with millions
of vertices, and provide a thorough analysis by evaluating result latency,
solution stability, and throughput.

Conclusion: PyloChain通过分层分片设计平衡了可用性和性能，实现了比现有技术更高的吞吐量和更低的延迟。

Abstract: Blockchain networks offer decentralization, transparency, and immutability
for managing critical data but encounter scalability problems as the number of
network members and transaction issuers grows. Sharding is considered a
promising solution to enhance blockchain scalability. However, most existing
blockchain sharding techniques prioritize performance at the cost of
availability (e.g., a failure in a few servers holding a shard leads to data
unavailability). In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded
blockchain that balances availability and performance. PyloChain consists of
multiple lower-level local chains and one higher-level main chain. Each local
chain speculatively executes local transactions to achieve high parallelism
across multiple local chains. The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph
(DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable
efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or
cross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively
executes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high
parallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,
PyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions
in the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to
mitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to
lower-level local members. We implemented and evaluated PyloChain,
demonstrating its performance scalability with 1.49x higher throughput and
2.63x faster latency compared to the state-of-the-art balanced hierarchical
sharded blockchain.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了可审计性概念，从单写入寄存器到多写入寄存器，并展示了如何实现可审计的$n$-写入$m$-读取寄存器，以及与LL/SC共享对象的关系。

Abstract: Auditability allows to track operations performed on a shared object,
recording who accessed which information. This gives data owners more control
on their data. Initially studied in the context of single-writer registers,
this work extends the notion of auditability to other shared objects, and
studies their properties.
  We start by moving from single-writer to multi-writer registers, and provide
an implementation of an auditable $n$-writer $m$-reader read / write register,
with $O(n+m)$ step complexity. This implementation uses $(m+n)$-sliding
registers, which have consensus number $m+n$. We show that this consensus
number is necessary. The implementation extends naturally to support an
auditable load-linked / store-conditional (LL/SC) shared object. LL/SC is a
primitive that supports efficient implementation of many shared objects.
Finally, we relate auditable registers to other access control objects, by
implementing an anti-flickering deny list from auditable registers.

Motivation: 支付通道网络（PCN）虽能提升区块链可扩展性，但其网络拓扑和交易决策需优化以最大化交易吞吐量并延长通道寿命。

Method: 采用近似算法设计PCN拓扑和交易决策策略，理论分析结合实证研究。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种在支付通道网络（PCN）中优化拓扑设计和交易决策的算法，通过理论分析和实证研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a promising technology that alleviates
blockchain scalability by shifting the transaction load from the blockchain to
the PCN. Nevertheless, the network topology has to be carefully designed to
maximise the transaction throughput in PCNs. Additionally, users in PCNs also
have to make optimal decisions on which transactions to forward and which to
reject to prolong the lifetime of their channels. In this work, we consider an
input sequence of transactions over $p$ parties. Each transaction consists of a
transaction size, source, and target, and can be either accepted or rejected
(entailing a cost). The goal is to design a PCN topology among the $p$
cooperating parties, along with the channel capacities, and then output a
decision for each transaction in the sequence to minimise the cost of creating
and augmenting channels, as well as the cost of rejecting transactions. Our
main contribution is an $\mathcal{O}(p)$ approximation algorithm for the
problem with $p$ parties. We further show that with some assumptions on the
distribution of transactions, we can reduce the approximation ratio to
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{p})$. We complement our theoretical analysis with an
empirical study of our assumptions and approach in the context of the Lightning
Network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学工作流通常计算密集且资源消耗大，导致高能耗和碳排放。尽管已有许多碳感知计算方法，但针对科学工作流的研究较少，而它们具有延迟容忍性、可中断性、可扩展性和异构性等特点，为碳感知计算提供了重要机会。

Method: 研究通过估算七个真实Nextflow工作流在不同集群基础设施上的碳足迹，并使用平均和边际碳强度数据，系统地评估了碳感知时间转移、暂停和恢复工作流以及资源调整的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过时间转移和资源调整等碳感知方法，科学工作流的碳排放可显著减少，时间转移最多可减少80%，资源调整可减少67%。

Abstract: Scientific workflows are widely used to automate scientific data analysis and
often involve computationally intensive processing of large datasets on compute
clusters. As such, their execution tends to be long-running and
resource-intensive, resulting in substantial energy consumption and, depending
on the energy mix, carbon emissions. Meanwhile, a wealth of carbon-aware
computing methods have been proposed, yet little work has focused specifically
on scientific workflows, even though they present a substantial opportunity for
carbon-aware computing because they are often significantly delay tolerant,
efficiently interruptible, highly scalable and widely heterogeneous. In this
study, we first exemplify the problem of carbon emissions associated with
running scientific workflows, and then show the potential for carbon-aware
workflow execution. For this, we estimate the carbon footprint of seven
real-world Nextflow workflows executed on different cluster infrastructures
using both average and marginal carbon intensity data. Furthermore, we
systematically evaluate the impact of carbon-aware temporal shifting, and the
pausing and resuming of the workflow. Moreover, we apply resource scaling to
workflows and workflow tasks. Finally, we report the potential reduction in
overall carbon emissions, with temporal shifting capable of decreasing
emissions by over 80%, and resource scaling capable of decreasing emissions by
67%.

Abstract: We introduce Black Marlin, the first Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based
Byzantine atomic broadcast protocol in a partially synchronous setting that
successfully forgoes the reliable broadcast and common coin primitives. Black
Marlin achieves the optimal latency of 3 rounds of communication (4.25 with
Byzantine faults) while maintaining optimal communication and amortized
communication complexities. We present a formal security analysis of the
protocol, accompanied by empirical evidence that Black Marlin outperforms
state-of-the-art DAG-based protocols in both throughput and latency.

Motivation: 物联网生态系统的快速增长加剧了在高度动态、分布式环境中高效分配异构资源的挑战。传统的集中式机制和单目标拍卖模型难以实现平衡的系统性能。

Method: MOHAF整合了分层聚类以减少计算复杂性，并采用贪心、子模优化策略保证(1-1/e)的近似比。动态定价机制实时适应资源利用率。

Conclusion: MOHAF提供了一种实用且适应性强的大规模物联网部署解决方案，有效平衡了分布式资源协调中的效率、公平性和可持续性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the
challenge of efficiently allocating heterogeneous resources in highly dynamic,
distributed environments. Conventional centralized mechanisms and
single-objective auction models, focusing solely on metrics such as cost
minimization or revenue maximization, struggle to deliver balanced system
performance. This paper proposes the Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction
Framework (MOHAF), a distributed resource allocation mechanism that jointly
optimizes cost, Quality of Service (QoS), energy efficiency, and fairness.
MOHAF integrates hierarchical clustering to reduce computational complexity
with a greedy, submodular optimization strategy that guarantees a (1-1/e)
approximation ratio. A dynamic pricing mechanism adapts in real time to
resource utilization, enhancing market stability and allocation quality.
Extensive experiments on the Google Cluster Data trace, comprising 3,553
requests and 888 resources, demonstrate MOHAF's superior allocation efficiency
(0.263) compared to Greedy (0.185), First-Price (0.138), and Random (0.101)
auctions, while achieving perfect fairness (Jain's index = 1.000). Ablation
studies reveal the critical influence of cost and QoS components in sustaining
balanced multi-objective outcomes. With near-linear scalability, theoretical
guarantees, and robust empirical performance, MOHAF offers a practical and
adaptable solution for large-scale IoT deployments, effectively reconciling
efficiency, equity, and sustainability in distributed resource coordination.

Abstract: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a critical operation underpinning a
wide range of applications in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial
intelligence (AI). The emergence of hardware optimized for low-precision
arithmetic necessitates a reevaluation of numerical algorithms to leverage
mixed-precision computations, achieving improved performance and energy
efficiency. This research introduces an adaptive mixed-precision GEMM framework
that supports different precision formats at fine-grained tile/block levels. We
utilize the PaRSEC runtime system to balance workloads across various

### [96] [The Cost Advantage of Virtual Machine Migrations: Empirical Insights into Amazon's EC2 Marketspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14883)
*Benedikt Pittl,Werner Mach,Erich Schikuta*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文通过分析亚马逊定价和Bitbrains数据，发现异构云组合和运行时迁移能显著降低成本，且虚拟机资源利用率低下，未来优化潜力大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云提供商推出新的虚拟机交易方式（如Virtustream的muVMs），以及市场空间（如亚马逊的六个市场空间）的多样化，如何构建最优的云组合（cloud-portfolios）成为行业研究的重要课题。

Method: 研究使用了亚马逊的定价数据和Bitbrains数据中心的真实虚拟机利用率数据集，并通过第二组Bitbrains数据中心的数据验证了结果的普适性。

Result: 研究结果表明，异构云组合能实现成本最优，且虚拟机运行时迁移（尤其是运行时间在6小时至1年之间）具有成本效益。同时，虚拟机资源利用率低下，存在进一步优化的空间。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，构建异构云组合（即从不同市场空间购买虚拟机）能够实现成本最优。此外，在运行时将虚拟机迁移到不同市场空间，尤其是运行时间在6小时至1年之间的虚拟机，具有显著的成本效益。研究还发现，虚拟机资源大部分未被充分利用，这为未来的成本优化提供了重要潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, cloud providers have introduced novel approaches for trading
virtual machines. For example, Virtustream introduced so-called muVMs to charge
cloud computing resources while other providers such as Google, Microsoft, or
Amazon re-invented their marketspaces. Today, the market leader Amazon runs six
marketspaces for trading virtual machines. Consumers can purchase bundles of
virtual machines, which are called cloud-portfolios, from multiple marketspaces
and providers. An industry-relevant field of research is to identify best
practices and guidelines on how such optimal portfolios are created. In the
paper at hand, a cost analysis of cloud portfolios is presented. Therefore,
pricing data from Amazon was used as well as a real virtual machine utilization
dataset from the Bitbrains datacenter. The results show that a cost optimum can
only be reached if heterogeneous portfolios are created where virtual machines
are purchased from different marketspaces. Additionally, the cost-benefit of
migrating virtual machines to different marketplaces during runtime is
presented. Such migrations are especially cost-effective for virtual machines
of cloud-portfolios which run between 6 hours and 1 year. The paper further
shows that most of the resources of virtual machines are never utilized by
consumers, which represents a significant future potential for cost
optimization. For the validation of the results, a second dataset of the
Bitbrains datacenter was used, which contains utility data of virtual machines
from a different domain of application.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在LEO卫星网络上进行实时视频分析的挑战与潜力，提出了StarStream框架，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实时视频分析系统主要依赖地面网络，限制了在自然灾害和偏远地区的应用，而LEO卫星网络的普及为这些场景提供了新的可能性。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的网络性能预测器和内容感知配置优化器，开发了StarStream框架，并通过真实网络和视频处理数据进行了实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，StarStream能够有效应对当前LSN的上行链路瓶颈和不稳定的网络条件，显著提升实时视频分析的服务质量。

Conclusion: 本文通过StarStream框架展示了在LEO卫星网络（LSN）上实现高效实时视频分析的潜力，并验证了其适应性和优越性。

Abstract: Streaming videos from resource-constrained front-end devices over networks to
resource-rich cloud servers has long been a common practice for surveillance
and analytics. Most existing live video analytics (LVA) systems, however, have
been built over terrestrial networks, limiting their applications during
natural disasters and in remote areas that desperately call for real-time
visual data delivery and scene analysis. With the recent advent of space
networking, in particular, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations such
as Starlink, high-speed truly global Internet access is becoming available and
affordable. This paper examines the challenges and potentials of LVA over
modern LEO satellite networking (LSN). Using Starlink as the testbed, we have
carried out extensive in-the-wild measurements to gain insights into its
achievable performance for LVA. The results reveal that the uplink bottleneck
in today's LSN, together with the volatile network conditions, can
significantly affect the service quality of LVA and necessitate prompt
adaptation. We accordingly develop StarStream, a novel LSN-adaptive streaming
framework for LVA. At its core, StarStream is empowered by a Transformer-based
network performance predictor tailored for LSN and a content-aware
configuration optimizer. We discuss a series of key design and implementation
issues of StarStream and demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority through
trace-driven experiments with real-world network and video processing data.

Conclusion: OmniSense框架通过轻量级的球形兴趣区域预测算法和智能缩放视觉模型，显著提升了360度视频分析的准确性和效率，同时优化了资源利用。

Abstract: With the reduced hardware costs of omnidirectional cameras and the
proliferation of various extended reality applications, more and more
$360^\circ$ videos are being captured. To fully unleash their potential,
advanced video analytics is expected to extract actionable insights and
situational knowledge without blind spots from the videos. In this paper, we
present OmniSense, a novel edge-assisted framework for online immersive video
analytics. OmniSense achieves both low latency and high accuracy, combating the
significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing
$360^\circ$ videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into $360^\circ$
videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI)
prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in $360^\circ$ frames.
Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales
vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource
utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and
evaluate it on diverse real-world collected $360^\circ$ videos. Extensive
evaluation results show that compared to resource-agnostic baselines, it
improves the accuracy by $19.8\%$ -- $114.6\%$ with similar end-to-end
latencies. Meanwhile, it hits $2.0\times$ -- $2.4\times$ speedups while keeping
the accuracy on par with the highest accuracy of baselines.

Conclusion: LEAD 提供了一个高效、可扩展且稳健的解决方案，显著优化了分布式键值系统中的范围查询性能。

Abstract: Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are pivotal in numerous high-impact key-value
applications built on distributed networked systems, offering a decentralized
architecture that avoids single points of failure and improves data
availability. Despite their widespread utility, DHTs face substantial
challenges in handling range queries, which are crucial for applications such
as LLM serving, distributed storage, databases, content delivery networks, and
blockchains. To address this limitation, we present LEAD, a novel system
incorporating learned models within DHT structures to significantly optimize
range query performance. LEAD utilizes a recursive machine learning model to
map and retrieve data across a distributed system while preserving the inherent
order of data. LEAD includes the designs to minimize range query latency and
message cost while maintaining high scalability and resilience to network
churn. Our comprehensive evaluations, conducted in both testbed implementation
and simulations, demonstrate that LEAD achieves tremendous advantages in system
efficiency compared to existing range query methods in large-scale distributed
systems, reducing query latency and message cost by 80% to 90%+. Furthermore,
LEAD exhibits remarkable scalability and robustness against system churn,
providing a robust, scalable solution for efficient data retrieval in
distributed key-value systems.

Motivation: 解决自适应路由面临的两个主要挑战：准确测量/估计时变流量矩阵和控制频繁路由变化导致的性能下降。

Method: 开发了一种基于历史路由数据和链路速率数据的DeeP-TE算法，无需直接测量或估计流量矩阵。

Result: 在真实网络拓扑和流量矩阵上的数值实验表明，DeeP-TE算法在控制效果上接近最优，且路由变化显著低于基线方法。

Conclusion: DeeP-TE算法通过优雅地调整路由配置，显著降低了网络拥塞，同时减少了路由变化频率，实现了接近最优的控制效果。

Abstract: Routing configurations of a network should constantly adapt to traffic
variations to achieve good network performance. Adaptive routing faces two main
challenges: 1) how to accurately measure/estimate time-varying traffic
matrices? 2) how to control the network and application performance degradation
caused by frequent route changes? In this paper, we develop a novel
data-enabled predictive traffic engineering (DeeP-TE) algorithm that minimizes
the network congestion by gracefully adapting routing configurations over time.
Our control algorithm can generate routing updates directly from the historical
routing data and the corresponding link rate data, without direct traffic
matrix measurement or estimation. Numerical experiments on real network
topologies with real traffic matrices demonstrate that the proposed DeeP-TE
routing adaptation algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal control effectiveness
with significantly lower routing variations than the baseline methods.

Abstract: Ensuring uninterrupted data flow in modern networks requires robust
fault-tolerant mechanisms, especially in environments where reliability and
responsiveness are critical. This paper presents the design and simulation of a
fault-tolerant network switching system using Python-based algorithms. A
simulated enterprise-level Local Area Network (LAN) was modeled using NetworkX
to represent switch-router interconnectivity with redundant links. Fault
scenarios, including link failure and congestion, were injected using Scapy,
while automatic failover and rerouting were implemented via custom Python
logic. The system demonstrates resilience by dynamically detecting path
failures, redistributing network traffic through redundant links, and
minimizing downtime. Performance evaluations reveal significant improvements in
packet delivery continuity, faster recovery times, and reduced packet loss
compared to non-fault-tolerant baselines. The implementation provides a
scalable and lightweight approach to integrating fault-tolerance features into
mid-scale networks, with potential application in enterprise information

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of large-scale Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite
constellations has introduced unprecedented opportunities for global
connectivity. However, routing efficiency and inter-shell communication remain
key challenges in multi-shell architectures. This paper investigates the
structural properties and network dynamics of a representative six-shell
mega-constellation composed of 10,956 satellites and 198 gateway stations
(GSs). Leveraging tools from complex network analysis, we identify several
critical findings: (1) the constellation exhibits strong small-world
characteristics, enabling efficient routing despite large network diameters;
(2) GS relays play a pivotal role in enhancing inter-shell connectivity by
bridging otherwise disconnected components; (3) feeder links significantly
reduce average path length, making long-haul communication more feasible; (4)
betweenness analysis reveals load imbalances among GSs, indicating the need for
traffic-aware management strategies; (5) the architecture offers excellent
spatial coverage and resilience, maintaining connectivity and low routing costs
even under GS failures. These insights not only explain the design rationale
behind current mega-constellations like SpaceX Starlink, but also provide
valuable guidance for the evolution of future satellite network
infrastructures.

Result: 仿真结果显示，随机化舍入和贪婪方法分别实现了与最优解相差5%和10%的总奖励。原型实验表明，冗余VNF在不同故障概率下提升了包交付率和延迟性能。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提出随机化舍入和贪婪启发式方法，有效解决了5G网络中VNF放置的NP难问题，实现了在资源约束下的高性能保证，并通过原型验证了冗余VNF对提升包交付率和延迟的积极作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the virtual network function (VNF) placement problem
in mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled 5G networks to meet the stringent
reliability and latency requirements of uRLLC applications. We pose it as a
constrained optimization problem, which is NP-hard, to maximize the total
reward obtained by a network service provider by serving uRLLC service
requests. We propose an approximated randomized rounding approach to solve the
NP-hard optimization problem in polynomial time. We prove that the proposed
randomized approach achieves performance guarantees while violating the
resource constraints boundedly. Furthermore, we present a greedy-heuristic
approach to tackle the violations of resource constraints.
  Simulation results show that the proposed randomized rounding and greedy
approaches achieve a total reward which is within 5% and 10% of the optimal
solution, respectively. Furthermore, we compare the proposed greedy approach
with the existing schemes that do not consider the availability requirements.
We observe that the existing schemes perform poorly in terms of total reward,
as negligence to the availability requirements negatively impacts the number of
successfully served requests. These findings highlight the trade-off between
availability and resource efficiency in latency-sensitive uRLLC applications.
We also implement a software prototype of a 5G network using open-source
software platforms with redundant placement of VNFs. The results on packet
delivery ratio and latency obtained from the prototype implementation are also
improved in the redundant VNFs with different failure probabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆环境需要低延迟和高吞吐量的通信，但实时网络选择受到多样化应用需求和多种无线接入技术（如4G、5G和ad hoc链路）共存的阻碍。

Method: ANS-V2X采用启发式驱动的方法，考虑应用敏感性、延迟、计算负载和方向性约束，将车辆分配到网络。

Result: 仿真结果表明，ANS-V2X实现了接近最优的性能，通常在MILP-V2X实现的效用的5%至10%范围内，同时将执行时间减少了85%以上。

Conclusion: ANS-V2X框架在延迟关键型V2X系统中展现出实时边缘部署的适用性，能够在15毫秒内完成决策，并提供比MILP-V2X和Q-learning方法更低的延迟。

Abstract: This paper presents ANS-V2X, an Adaptive Network Selection framework tailored
for latency-aware V2X systems operating under varying vehicle densities and
heterogeneous network conditions. Modern vehicular environments demand
low-latency and high-throughput communication, yet real-time network selection
is hindered by diverse application requirements and the coexistence of multiple
Radio Access Technologies (RATs) such as 4G, 5G, and ad hoc links. ANS-V2X
employs a heuristic-driven approach to assign vehicles to networks by
considering application sensitivity, latency, computational load, and
directionality constraints. The framework is benchmarked against a
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for optimal solutions and a
Q-learning-based method representing reinforcement learning. Simulation results
demonstrate that ANS-V2X achieves near-optimal performance, typically within 5
to 10% of the utility achieved by MILP-V2X, while reducing execution time by
more than 85%. Although MILP-V2X offers globally optimal results, its
computation time often exceeds 100 milliseconds, making it unsuitable for
real-time applications. The Q-learning-based method is more adaptable but
requires extensive training and converges slowly in dynamic scenarios. In
contrast, ANS-V2X completes decisions in under 15 milliseconds and consistently
delivers lower latency than both alternatives. This confirms its suitability
for real-time, edge-level deployment in latency-critical V2X systems

Conclusion: 所提出的多层级无人机辅助边缘计算系统通过动态优化任务分配、资源分配和轨迹规划，显著降低了L-UAVs的传输能耗并提升了能量稳定性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-tier UAV-assisted edge computing system
designed for low-altitude networks. The system comprises vehicle users,
lightweight Low-Tier UAVs (L-UAVs), and High-Tier UAV (H-UAV). L-UAVs function
as small-scale edge servers positioned closer to vehicle users, while the
H-UAV, equipped with more powerful server and larger-capacity battery, serves
as mobile backup server to address the limitations in endurance and computing
resources of L-UAVs. The primary objective is to minimize task execution delays
while ensuring long-term energy stability for L-UAVs. To address this
challenge, the problem is first decoupled into a series of deterministic
problems for each time slot using Lyapunov optimization. The priorities of task
delay and energy consumption for L-UAVs are adaptively adjusted based on
real-time energy status. The optimization tasks include assignment of tasks,
allocation of computing resources, and trajectory planning for both L-UAVs and
H-UAV. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a
reduction of at least 26% in transmission energy for L-UAVs and exhibits
superior energy stability compared to existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统无线传感器网络（WSNs）部署依赖预先分析，导致覆盖冗余和能源浪费。移动无线传感器网络（MWSNs）通过传感器移动性可更灵活应对覆盖和能源问题，但缺乏自主部署策略。

Method: 通过结合实时摄像头系统和深度强化学习（DRL），监测传感器LED指示灯并评估实时覆盖情况，利用多智能体强化学习（MARL）框架实现分散式协作控制。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉和多智能体强化学习的移动无线传感器网络自主部署策略，显著提升了覆盖范围、能源效率和网络寿命，为物联网框架内的实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) typically rely on pre-analysis of
the target area, network size, and sensor coverage to determine initial
deployment. This often results in significant overlap to ensure continued
network operation despite sensor energy depletion. With the emergence of Mobile
Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs), issues such as sensor failure and static
coverage limitations can be more effectively addressed through mobility. This
paper proposes a novel deployment strategy in which mobile sensors autonomously
position themselves to maximize area coverage, eliminating the need for
predefined policies. A live camera system, combined with deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), monitors the network by detecting sensor LED indicators and
evaluating real-time coverage. Rewards based on coverage efficiency and sensor
movement are computed at each learning step and shared across the network
through a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework, enabling
decentralized, cooperative sensor control. Key contributions include a
vision-based, low-cost coverage evaluation method; a scalable MARL-DRL
framework for autonomous deployment; and a self-reconfigurable system that
adjusts sensor positioning in response to energy depletion. Compared to
traditional distance-based localization, the proposed method achieves a 26.5%
improvement in coverage, a 32% reduction in energy consumption, and a 22%
decrease in redundancy, extending network lifetime by 45%. This approach
significantly enhances adaptability, energy efficiency, and robustness in
MWSNs, offering a practical deployment solution within the IoT framework.

Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
to extend network lifetime and ensure reliable data transmission. This paper
presents a novel method using reinforcement learning-based cluster-head
selection and a hybrid multi-hop routing algorithm, which leverages Q-learning
within a multi-agent system to dynamically adapt transmission paths based on
the energy distribution across sensor nodes. Each sensor node is modeled as an
autonomous agent that observes local state parameters, such as residual energy,
distance to sink, hop count, and hotspot proximity, and selects routing actions
that maximize long-term energy efficiency. After computing the optimal paths,
each sensor aggregates sensed data and forwards it through intermediate nodes
to a selected transmitter node, chosen based on the highest remaining State of
Charge (SoC), thereby avoiding premature node depletion. To promote efficient
learning, a carefully designed reward function incentivizes balanced load
distribution, hotspot avoidance, and energy-aware forwarding while maintaining
signal quality. The learning process occurs either in a decentralized manner or
via a cloud-based controller that offloads computation in large-scale
deployments. Moreover, the RL-driven routing decisions are fused with classical
graph-based methods, Minimum Energy Routing Algorithm (MERA) and Minimum
Spanning Tree (MST), to optimize energy consumption and load balancing.
Simulations confirm that the proposed approach significantly improves node
survival rate, reduces SoC variance, and enhances network resilience, making it
a scalable and adaptive solution for energy-constrained WSNs in dynamic sensor
deployments and IoT applications.

Conclusion: LLMs在情感刺激解释方面与人类有相似之处，但也存在差异，尤其是在五分类情感框架中表现更佳，但情感评级比人类更同质化。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结构化示例如何提升LLM智能体的视角采择能力，发现仅靠结构化示例不足，需结合信念追踪和成本建模以实现更好的协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM和推理框架取得了进展，但在涉及主动感知、协作推理和视角采择的任务中，基于LLM的系统仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出了一种结构化解决方案处理流程，生成三种类型的示例：最优目标路径（G型）、信息节点路径（E型）和逐步最优决策序列（L型），并通过LLM将其转换为“思维-行动”示例。

Result: L型示例略微减少了澄清请求和总体行动步骤，但未带来一致的改进。智能体在需要基本注意力过滤的任务中表现成功，但在涉及遮挡空间或权衡认知行动成本的场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 结构化示例本身不足以实现稳健的视角采择，需要明确的信念追踪、成本建模和更丰富的环境来支持基于LLM的智能体的社会性协作。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的H-J框架通过分层多智能体方法，结合知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化，有效提升了城市洪水应急响应中的决策能力，增强了系统的韧性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过于简单，无法捕捉真实应用中的挑战（如长时推理和大规模陌生工具空间），因此需要开发更全面的评估标准。

Method: 通过设计与真实世界MCP服务器交互的6个核心领域（11个服务器）任务，并采用执行式评估器（格式、静态、动态）进行严格评估。

Result: SOTA模型（如GPT-5、Grok-4、Claude-4.0-Sonnet）表现受限，企业级代理（如Cursor）未超越标准ReAct框架。

Conclusion: MCP-Universe作为首个全面评估LLM在真实任务中表现的基准，揭示了现有SOTA模型的显著性能局限，并提出了长上下文和未知工具等挑战。同时，开源的可扩展评估框架促进了MCP生态的创新。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于PAC学习范式的数据驱动方法，用于确定具有离散抽象的CPS在有限时间步长内的安全概率，并通过主动学习范式验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能够自省，并提出一个更严格的‘厚重’自省定义，以区别于现有的‘轻量级’定义。

Method: 通过实验，让大型语言模型（LLMs）推理其内部温度参数，测试其自省能力。

Result: 实验显示，LLMs在某些情况下表现出轻量级自省能力，但无法满足论文提出的‘厚重’自省定义。

Conclusion: 论文认为AI模型目前无法实现有意义的自省，尽管在某些情况下表现出轻量级的自省能力。

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct geometry and reflectance from captured
images. Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task:
each pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the
polarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular
separation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world
dataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as
light stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of
display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first
real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we
construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo
polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse
geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We
also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the
synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different
noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing
photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet
effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming
state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods. Code and dataset are available on

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications
like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often
rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,
restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To
address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that
reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python
scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs
capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we
construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each
object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a
multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into
executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior
performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates
intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code
modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these
contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for
programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic,
which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose
a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only
two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier
for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the
difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from
the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on
foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input
images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an
enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information,
and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are
directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.
Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on
a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain
datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with
images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data
collection. Demos and code are available at

Abstract: This study investigates the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
public management, focusing on optimizing path planning to address challenges
such as energy consumption, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints. As
UAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven
by advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands,
efficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies:
Target Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance
exploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal
detours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path
smoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized
buildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\% success rate with
an average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and
smoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45{\deg}). Despite improvements,
limitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and
potential local optima due to goal biasing. The study highlights dRRT's

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法主要优化速度跟踪而非直接姿态到达，导致短距离任务效率低下，需开发更高效的方法。

Method: 采用强化学习方法，结合新设计的星座奖励函数，直接优化人形机器人对SE(2)目标的运动表现。

Result: 在能量消耗、到达时间和步数等指标上，所提方法均优于标准方法，并成功实现仿真到硬件的转移。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于星座的奖励函数和强化学习方法在仿真和硬件转移中均表现出色，显著提升了人形机器人在短距离SE(2)目标运动中的效率。

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于优化的任务与运动规划框架，通过统一的接触模式表示，实现了人形机器人运动和操作的统一规划，并在复杂行为序列中展现了物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了统一规划机器人的运动和操作行为，并解决现有方法在复杂行为序列和物理一致性方面的不足，本研究提出了一个共享接触模式表示的TAMP框架。

Method: 通过将符号动作定义为接触模式变化，将高层规划与低层运动统一起来，实现了任务、接触和运动规划的统一搜索，同时纳入了全身动力学以及机器人、操作对象和环境之间的所有约束。

Result: 在一个人形机器人平台上，该方法能够生成广泛的物理一致的操控行为，覆盖了需要复杂推理的长动作序列。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于优化的任务与运动规划（TAMP）框架，首次实现了人形机器人全身动力学和驱动约束下的完全无环规划，为复杂的行为序列提供了物理一致的解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents an optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP)
framework that unifies planning for locomotion and manipulation through a
shared representation of contact modes. We define symbolic actions as contact
mode changes, grounding high-level planning in low-level motion. This enables a
unified search that spans task, contact, and motion planning while
incorporating whole-body dynamics, as well as all constraints between the
robot, the manipulated object, and the environment. Results on a humanoid
platform show that our method can generate a broad range of physically
consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long action sequences requiring
complex reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
enables the resolution of an integrated TAMP formulation with fully acyclic
planning and whole body dynamics with actuation constraints for the humanoid
loco-manipulation problem.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于CCGAN的领域翻译框架，用于软机器人跨领域知识迁移，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于软机器人的复杂性和非线性，传统分析方法需要精确了解其结构和材料特性，这在实践中具有挑战性。此外，软机器人的材料会随时间逐渐退化，使得在一个领域学习的映射无法直接转移到具有不同物理特性的另一个领域。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于条件循环生成对抗网络（CCGAN）的领域翻译框架，通过动态学习方法将一个在标准模拟环境中训练的姿态控制器适应到粘度增加十倍的领域。

Result: 通过五种不同形状的轨迹跟踪实验，以及在噪声扰动和周期性测试下的鲁棒性评估，结果表明CCGAN-GP能够有效实现跨领域技能迁移。

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP框架有效促进了跨领域技能迁移，为更适应和通用的软机器人控制器铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

Motivation: 多机器人在连续状态和动作空间中的导航与路径规划在不确定环境中仍是一个开放挑战。现有RL方法在现实应用中存在样本效率低、训练周期长且缺乏形式化保证的问题。

Method: 本文提出了一个高效且高度可定制的连续控制多机器人导航环境，将任务建模为MDP，并设计了多个环境变体，使用梯度与非梯度RL方法（A2C、PPO、TRPO、TQC、CrossQ和ARS）进行性能评估。

Conclusion: 本文的工作为研究人员提供了开发适用于现实系统的MDP基础环境的方法，并展示了如何利用现有最先进的RL方法在有限资源和合理时间内解决问题。

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action
spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving
this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample
inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL
for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the
environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable
environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots
must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths.
The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe
the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to
finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the
environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient
based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world
applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with
uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness
by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the
researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to
real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL
methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.

Conclusion: SimGenHOI框架通过结合生成建模和强化学习的优势，成功生成了可控且物理上合理的人形物体交互（HOI），显著提高了模拟中的跟踪成功率，并支持长时程操作任务。

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a lightweight tracking controller, based on
a flow version of the Newton-Raphson method, applied to a miniature blimp and a
mid-size quadrotor. This tracking technique has been shown to enjoy theoretical
guarantees of performance and has been applied with success in simulation
studies and on mobile robots with simple motion models. This paper investigates
the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware
platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational
constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the
established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and
nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The
performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of
flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms'
computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control
algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based
tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the
baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy
expenditure.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种针对平面空间中障碍物密集环境的2D探索策略，通过实验验证了该策略在确保移动代理安全的同时，有效探索未检测区域的能力。

Abstract: This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered
with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their
position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents
with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a
self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the
place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular
gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs
RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop
closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton
approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles.
During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of
the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the
agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of
undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are
presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

Motivation: 控制微重力环境下的空间机械臂系统具有挑战性，主要由于机械臂与航天器底座之间的动态耦合。本研究受动物（如蜥蜴）空中调整反射行为的启发，探索如何将这些生物行为转化为空间机器人的控制策略。

Method: 从高速视频记录中提取动物空中调整运动轨迹，并在多目标优化框架中分析这些轨迹以确定关键行为目标及其相对重要性。然后将这些运动轨迹作为参考轨迹应用于空间机械臂系统控制，并使用基线控制器进行跟踪。

Conclusion: 该研究通过生物启发方法，将动物空中调整反射行为转化为空间机械臂系统的控制策略，为未来任务中的机动性和鲁棒性提供了潜在改进方案。

Abstract: Robotic arms mounted on spacecraft, known as space manipulator systems
(SMSs), are critical for enabling on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and
debris removal. However, controlling these systems in microgravity remains a
significant challenge due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and
the spacecraft base. This study explores the potential of using biological
inspiration to address this issue, focusing on animals, particularly lizards,
that exhibit mid-air righting reflexes. Based on similarities between SMSs and
these animals in terms of behavior, morphology, and environment, their
air-righting motion trajectories are extracted from high-speed video recordings
using computer vision techniques. These trajectories are analyzed within a
multi-objective optimization framework to identify the key behavioral goals and
assess their relative importance. The resulting motion profiles are then
applied as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers
used to track them. The findings provide a step toward translating evolved
animal behaviors into interpretable, adaptive control strategies for space
robotics, with implications for improving maneuverability and robustness in
future missions.

Conclusion: 提出的增强型LIO框架通过自适应异常值容忍对应和扫描到子图注册策略，显著提高了在复杂环境中的定位和建图准确性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) plays a vital role in achieving accurate
localization and mapping, especially in complex environments. However, the
presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state
estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that
integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap
registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier
removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance
and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of
feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible
scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose
estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses
IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the
scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and
outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of both robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: 通过轨迹对齐和动态时间规整（DTW）距离，DTWIL方法显著提升了在动作约束下的模仿学习性能，并在多个机器人控制任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的飞行规划器可能导致部分UAS获得不成比例的短飞行路径，而牺牲其他UAS的利益。Fair-CoPlan旨在通过公平方式优化飞行路径长度。

Method: Fair-CoPlan分为三个步骤：PSU基于容量限制起飞和降落选择，运营商在约束下独立规划，PSU优化解决路径冲突，确保路径长度的公平性。

Result: 模拟实验表明，与非公平规划器相比，Fair-CoPlan实现了更公平的结果，仅以轻微延迟为代价。

Conclusion: Fair-CoPlan通过公平分配飞行路径成本，促进了UAM的广泛参与，确保了空域安全，并提升了运营商的灵活性。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation paradigm in which
Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomously transport passengers and goods in
cities. The UAS have different operators with different, sometimes competing
goals, yet must share the airspace. We propose a negotiated, semi-distributed
flight planner that optimizes UAS' flight lengths {\em in a fair manner}.
Current flight planners might result in some UAS being given disproportionately
shorter flight paths at the expense of others. We introduce Fair-CoPlan, a
planner in which operators and a Provider of Service to the UAM (PSU) together
compute \emph{fair} flight paths. Fair-CoPlan has three steps: First, the PSU
constrains take-off and landing choices for flights based on capacity at and
around vertiports. Then, operators plan independently under these constraints.
Finally, the PSU resolves any conflicting paths, optimizing for path length
fairness. By fairly spreading the cost of deconfliction Fair-CoPlan encourages
wider participation in UAM, ensures safety of the airspace and the areas below
it, and promotes greater operator flexibility. We demonstrate Fair-CoPlan
through simulation experiments and find fairer outcomes than a non-fair planner
with minor delays as a trade-off.

Conclusion: FiReFly算法在模拟的到达-规避任务中，能够生成更公平的轨迹并提高任务成功率，同时实时性能在15架无人机内可实现，扩展到50架无人机时需在运行时间和公平性提升之间权衡。

Abstract: We propose injecting notions of fairness into multi-robot motion planning.
When robots have competing interests, it is important to optimize for some kind
of fairness in their usage of resources. In this work, we explore how the
robots' energy expenditures might be fairly distributed among them, while
maintaining mission success. We formulate a distributed fair motion planner and
integrate it with safe controllers in a algorithm called FiReFly. For simulated
reach-avoid missions, FiReFly produces fairer trajectories and improves mission
success rates over a non-fair planner. We find that real-time performance is
achievable up to 15 UAVs, and that scaling up to 50 UAVs is possible with
trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvements.

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

Abstract: Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments
faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected
during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model
(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on
one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic
adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the
processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)
for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)
a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks
specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an
online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and
explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an
optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via
search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop
verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both
subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected
online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning
capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,
simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and
explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances,
with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks

Conclusion: FBI框架通过动态融合视觉和触觉信号，显著提升了机器人灵巧手操作的性能，在模拟和实际环境中均优于基线方法。

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics due
to complex contact dynamics and partial observability. While humans synergize
vision and touch for such tasks, robotic approaches often prioritize one
modality, therefore limiting adaptability. This paper introduces Flow Before
Imitation (FBI), a visuotactile imitation learning framework that dynamically
fuses tactile interactions with visual observations through motion dynamics.
Unlike prior static fusion methods, FBI establishes a causal link between
tactile signals and object motion via a dynamics-aware latent model. FBI
employs a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile
features with visual inputs, training a one-step diffusion policy for real-time
execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the baseline methods in both simulation and the real world on two
customized in-hand manipulation tasks and three standard dexterous manipulation
tasks. Code, models, and more results are available in the website

Abstract: This technical report presents the champion solution of the Table Service
Track in the ICRA 2025 What Bimanuals Can Do (WBCD) competition. We tackled a
series of demanding tasks under strict requirements for speed, precision, and
reliability: unfolding a tablecloth (deformable-object manipulation), placing a
pizza onto the table (pick-and-place), and opening and closing a food container
with the lid. Our solution combines VR-based teleoperation and Learning from
Demonstrations (LfD) to balance robustness and autonomy. Most subtasks were
executed through high-fidelity remote teleoperation, while the pizza placement
was handled by an ACT-based policy trained from 100 in-person teleoperated
demonstrations with randomized initial configurations. By carefully integrating
scoring rules, task characteristics, and current technical capabilities, our
approach achieved both high efficiency and reliability, ultimately securing the
first place in the competition.

Abstract: To address the challenges of localization drift and perception-planning
coupling in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in open-top scenarios
(e.g., collapsed buildings, roofless mazes), this paper proposes EAROL, a novel
framework with a downward-mounted tilted LiDAR configuration (20{\deg}
inclination), integrating a LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) system and a
hierarchical trajectory-yaw optimization algorithm. The hardware innovation
enables constraint enhancement via dense ground point cloud acquisition and
forward environmental awareness for dynamic obstacle detection. A
tightly-coupled LIO system, empowered by an Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(IESKF) with dynamic motion compensation, achieves high level 6-DoF
localization accuracy in feature-sparse environments. The planner, augmented by
environment, balancing environmental exploration, target tracking precision,
and energy efficiency. Physical experiments demonstrate 81% tracking error
reduction, 22% improvement in perceptual coverage, and near-zero vertical drift
across indoor maze and 60-meter-scale outdoor scenarios. This work proposes a
hardware-algorithm co-design paradigm, offering a robust solution for UAV
autonomy in post-disaster search and rescue missions. We will release our

Result: 仿真结果表明TRUST-Planner优于基线方法，在复杂环境中实现了96%的成功率和毫秒级计算效率，并通过实际实验验证了其可行性。

Conclusion: TRUST-Planner在复杂动态环境中表现出色，实现了96%的成功率和毫秒级计算效率，验证了其可行性和实用性。

Abstract: Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial
vehicles (AAVs), existing frameworks faces the challenges of local minima and
deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks.
To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided
hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance.
In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is
proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend
utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and
dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance
and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch
trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal
topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical
information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that
TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate
and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments.
Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the
proposed method.

Motivation: 探索LLM是否能在多智能体环境中支持有效协作，解决需要分工、优先级和合作规划的复杂任务。

Method: 通过在完全已知的图基环境中分配资源给不同需求和紧急程度的受害者，系统评估LLM智能体的表现。

Result: 使用协调敏感指标（如任务成功率、冗余行动、房间冲突和紧急加权效率）评估LLM智能体的表现。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLM在多智能体协作任务中展现出潜力，但也存在失败模式，为未来基准测试和架构改进提供了方向。

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的自适应路径规划框架在动态环境中有效跟踪移动目标，并通过实地测试验证了其在实际监测场景中的应用能力。

Abstract: Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information
gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in
dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and
pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets
that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is
a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal
variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative
path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with
initially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our
approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position
distributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target
tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our
proposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to
existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning
objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests using an autonomous
surface vehicle, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world
monitoring scenarios.

Abstract: Aiming to enhance the consistency and thus long-term accuracy of Extended
Kalman Filters for terrestrial vehicle localization, this paper introduces the
Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF). By representing the
robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures
feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial
constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The
accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and
tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground
geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme
that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more
accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency.
The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state
estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing
implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and
dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical
filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it
eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its
application in a variety of real-world settings.

Abstract: Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated
technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and
enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly
specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers
to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to
develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform
multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry
experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these
collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to
ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand
what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a
safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.
For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors
nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human
comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an
instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact
between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce
a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an
LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we
design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the
human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure
safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's
actions which we validate through a user study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Nelson和Nguyen在FOCS 2013上提出的关于最优维度和稀疏性的猜想，并探索更快的子当前矩阵乘法时间缩减方法。

Method: 使用了一种称为迭代解耦的矩阵集中技术，以微调通过现有随机矩阵普适性工具获得的高阶迹矩边界。

Result: 对于任何n≥d和ε≥d^{-O(1)}，存在一个随机矩阵Π，具有特定稀疏性，能够高概率地保持线性回归任务的范数。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了Nelson和Nguyen关于最优维度和稀疏性的猜想，并提出了新的子当前矩阵乘法时间缩减方法。

Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the
optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to
sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$,
there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde
O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any
$A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability,
$(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all
$x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic
factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current
matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a
broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call
iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment
bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya
and van Handel, GAFA 2024].

TL;DR: 论文填补了在线排序问题的指数级差距，提出了接近最优的确定性算法，优化了空间与竞争比率的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线排序问题中，先前的研究在确定性算法的上下界之间存在指数级差距，本论文旨在填补这一差距并优化空间与竞争比率的权衡。

Method: 论文提出了两种确定性算法：一种是针对m=(1+ε)n的O(log²n/ε)-competitive算法，另一种是针对m=γn（γ∈[O(1),O(log²n)]）的O(log²n/γ)-competitive算法。

Result: 论文提出的算法在m=(1+ε)n和m=γn的情况下分别实现了O(log²n/ε)和O(log²n/γ)的竞争比率，接近下界。此外，还扩展了结果至未知数字范围的情况。

Conclusion: 本论文几乎完全解决了在线排序问题，通过提出确定性算法，显著缩小了先前存在的指数级差距，并提供了接近最优的空间与竞争比率的权衡。

Abstract: In the online sorting problem, a sequence of $n$ numbers in $[0, 1]$
(including $\{0,1\}$) have to be inserted in an array of size $m \ge n$ so as
to minimize the sum of absolute differences between pairs of numbers occupying
consecutive non-empty cells. Previously, Aamand {\em et al.} (SODA 2023) gave a
deterministic $2^{\sqrt{\log n} \sqrt{\log \log n + \log
(1/\varepsilon)}}$-competitive algorithm when $m = (1+\varepsilon) n$ for any
$\varepsilon \ge \Omega(\log n/n)$. They also showed a lower bound: with $m =
\gamma n$ space, the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is at
least $\frac{1}{\gamma}\cdot\Omega(\log n / \log \log n)$. This left an
exponential gap between the upper and lower bounds for the problem.
  In this paper, we bridge this exponential gap and almost completely resolve
the online sorting problem. First, we give a deterministic $O(\log^2 n /
\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm with $m = (1+\varepsilon) n$, for any
$\varepsilon \ge \Omega(\log n / n)$. Next, for $m = \gamma n$ where $\gamma =
[O(1), O(\log^2 n)]$, we give a deterministic $O(\log^2 n /
\gamma)$-competitive algorithm. In particular, this implies an
$O(1)$-competitive algorithm with $O(n \log^2 n)$ space, which is within an
$O(\log n\cdot \log \log n)$ factor of the lower bound of $\Omega(n \log n /
\log \log n)$. Combined, the two results imply a close to optimal tradeoff
between space and competitive ratio for the entire range of interest:
specifically, an upper bound of $O(\log^2 n)$ on the product of the competitive
ratio and $\gamma$ while the lower bound on this product is $\Omega(\log n /
\log\log n)$. We also show that these results can be extended to the case when
the range of the numbers is not known in advance, for an additional $O(\log n)$
factor in the competitive ratio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在超有限性假设下，有界度图的$k$-disc分布在亚线性时间内的近似问题，明确分离切割误差和采样误差的影响。

Method: 作者重新审视了Hassidim等人的分区预言机框架，通过采样$N=\lceil C\varepsilon^{-2} \rceil$个顶点并查询局部分区预言机，构建了一个摘要图$H$，其$k$-disc频率向量在$\ell_1$-距离内以高概率近似原始图。

Result: 通过结合切割误差和采样误差的控制，实现了$\ell_1$-误差为$\varepsilon$的高概率近似，摘要图$H$的大小为$poly(d^k,1/\varepsilon)$，运行时间为$poly(d,k,\varepsilon^{-1})$。

Conclusion: 该论文通过分区预言机框架，结合切割误差和采样误差的控制，成功在亚线性时间内近似了有界度图的$k$-disc分布，并明确了运行时和摘要大小对参数$d$、$k$和$\varepsilon$的依赖关系。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of approximating the $k$-disc
distribution (``frequency vector") of a bounded-degree graph in sublinear-time
under the assumption of hyperfiniteness. We revisit the partition-oracle
framework of Hassidim, Kelner, Nguyen, and Onak \cite{hassidim2009local}, and
provide a concise, self-contained analysis that explicitly separates the two
sources of error: (i) the cut error, controlled by hyperfiniteness parameter
$\phi$, which incurs at most $\varepsilon/2$ in $\ell_1$-distance by removing
at most $\phi |V|$ edges; and (ii) the sampling error, controlled by the
accuracy parameter $\varepsilon$, bounded by $\varepsilon/2$ via
$N=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$ random vertex queries and a Chernoff and union
bound argument. Combining these yields an overall $\ell_1$-error of
$\varepsilon$ with high probability. Algorithmically, we show that by sampling
$N=\lceil C\varepsilon^{-2} \rceil$ vertices and querying the local partition
oracle, one can in time $poly(d,k,\varepsilon^{-1})$ construct a summary graph
$H$ of size $|H|=poly(d^k,1/\varepsilon)$ whose $k$-disc frequency vector
approximates that of the original graph within $\varepsilon$ in
$\ell_1$-distance. Our approach clarifies the dependence of both runtime and
summary-size on the parameter $d$,$k$, and $\varepsilon$.

Motivation: 解决在线排序问题，改进现有算法的成本，特别是针对确定性算法。

Method: 研究在线排序问题，其中$n$个实数以在线方式到达，算法必须立即将每个数字放入大小为$(1+\varepsilon) n$的数组中，成本定义为数组中相邻数字的绝对差之和。

Result: 提出了一种确定性算法，其成本为$\left(\varepsilon^{-1}\log n\right)^{O\left(\log \log n\right)}$。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种确定性算法，用于在线排序问题，其成本为$\left(\varepsilon^{-1}\log n\right)^{O\left(\log \log n\right)}$，改进了之前的结果。

Abstract: We study the online sorting problem, where $n$ real numbers arrive in an
online fashion, and the algorithm must immediately place each number into an
array of size $(1+\varepsilon) n$ before seeing the next number. After all $n$
numbers are placed into the array, the cost is defined as the sum over the
absolute differences of all $n-1$ pairs of adjacent numbers in the array,
ignoring empty array cells. Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta, and Kleist introduced
the problem and obtained a deterministic algorithm with cost
$2^{O\left(\sqrt{\log n \cdot\log\log n +\log \varepsilon^{-1}}\right)}$, and a
lower bound of $\Omega(\log n / \log\log n)$ for deterministic algorithms. We
obtain a deterministic algorithm with quasi-polylogarithmic cost
$\left(\varepsilon^{-1}\log n\right)^{O\left(\log \log n\right)}$.
  Concurrent and independent work by Azar, Panigrahi, and Vardi achieves
polylogarithmic cost $O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log^2 n)$.

Abstract: Palindromes are strings that read the same forward and backward. The
computation of palindromic structures within strings is a fundamental problem
in string algorithms, being motivated by potential applications in formal
language theory and bioinformatics. Although the number of palindromic factors
in a string of length $n$ can be quadratic, they can be implicitly represented
in $O(n \log n)$ bits of space by storing the lengths of all maximal
palindromes in an integer array, which can be computed in $O(n)$ time
[Manacher, 1975]. In this paper, we propose a novel $O(n)$-bit representation
of all maximal palindromes in a string, which enables $O(1)$-time retrieval of
the length of the maximal palindrome centered at any given position. Since
Manacher's algorithm and the notion of maximal palindromes are widely utilized
for solving numerous problems involving palindromic structures, our compact
representation will accelerate the development of more space-efficient
solutions. Indeed, as the first application of our compact representation of
maximal palindromes, we present a data structure of size $O(n)$ bits that can
compute the longest palindrome appearing in any given factor of the string in
$O(\log n)$ time.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for incremental-decremental maximization that
captures the gradual transformation or renewal of infrastructures. In our
model, an initial solution is transformed one element at a time and the utility
of an intermediate solution is given by the sum of the utilities of the
transformed and untransformed parts. We propose a simple randomized and a
deterministic algorithm that both find an order in which to transform the
elements while maintaining a large utility during all stages of transformation,
relative to an optimum solution for the current stage. More specifically, our
algorithms yield competitive solutions for utility functions of bounded
curvature and/or generic submodularity ratio, and, in particular, for
submodular functions, and gross substitute functions. Our results exhibit that
incremental-decremental maximization is substantially more difficult than
incremental maximization.

Abstract: We consider the $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problem $\mathrm{P} \mathbf{\vert}
\mathrm{pmtn, setup=s_i} \mathbf{\vert} \mathrm{C_{\max}}$, the problem of
scheduling $n$ jobs, which are divided into $c$ classes, on $m$ identical
parallel machines while allowing preemption. For each class $i$ of the $c$
classes, we are given a setup time $s_i$ that is required to be scheduled
whenever a machine switches from processing a job of one class to a job from
another class. The goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the makespan.
  We give a $(4/3+\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithm with run time in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log(1/\varepsilon))$. For any $\varepsilon < 1/6$, this
improves upon the previously best known approximation ratio of $3/2$ for this
problem.
  Our main technical contributions are as follows. We first partition any
instance into an "easy" and a "hard" part, such that a $4/3 T$-approximation
for the former is easy to compute for some given makespan $T$. We then proceed
to show our main structural result, namely that there always exists a $4/3
T$-approximation for any instance that has a solution with makespan $T$, where
the hard part has some easy to compute properties. Finally, we obtain an
algorithm that computes a $(4/3+\varepsilon)$-approximation in time n
$\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log(1/\varepsilon))$ for general instances by computing
solutions with the previously shown structural properties.
