Traditional half-duplex architectures such as DDR5\nare ill-suited for such workloads, suffering bus turnaround penalties that\nreduce their effective bandwidth under mixed read-write patterns. Compute\nExpress Link (CXL) offers a breakthrough with its full-duplex channels, yet\nthis architectural potential remains untapped as existing software stacks are\noblivious to this capability. This paper introduces CXLAimPod, an adaptive\nscheduling framework designed to bridge this software-hardware gap through\nsystem support, including cgroup-based hints for application-aware\noptimization. Our characterization quantifies the opportunity, revealing that\nCXL systems achieve 55-61% bandwidth improvement at balanced read-write ratios\ncompared to flat DDR5 performance, demonstrating the benefits of full-duplex\narchitecture. To realize this potential, the CXLAimPod framework integrates\nmultiple scheduling strategies with a cgroup-based hint mechanism to navigate\nthe trade-offs between throughput, latency, and overhead. Implemented\nefficiently within the Linux kernel via eBPF, CXLAimPod delivers significant\nperformance improvements over default CXL configurations. Evaluation on diverse\nworkloads shows 7.4% average improvement for Redis (with up to 150% for\nspecific sequential patterns), 71.6% improvement for LLM text generation, and\n9.1% for vector databases, demon-strating that duplex-aware scheduling can\neffectively exploit CXL's architectural advantages."}

We first formulate ICIM as a resource\nallocation optimization problem aimed at maximizing a user-defined reward\nfunction and then develop an online learning solution by integrating a\ndiffusion model into an RL framework for near-real-time policy generation.\nParticularly, we introduce a novel metric, preference values, as the policy\nrepresentation to enable efficient policy-guided resource allocation within\nO-RAN distributed units (DUs). We implement xDiff on a 5G testbed consisting of\nthree cells and a set of smartphones in two small-cell scenarios.

Our model is\ninspired by recent work on FPT algorithms for MinCSP where frequently both\nupper and lower bounds on the parameterized complexity of a problem correspond\nto $k$-variable udCSPs; e.g., the FPT algorithms for Boolean MinCSP (Kim et\nal., SODA 2023) and Directed Multicut with three cut requests (Hatzel et al.,\nSODA 2023) both reduce to k-variable udCSPs, and the canonical W[1]-hardness\nconstruction in the area, Paired Min Cut by Marx and Razgon (IPL 2009), is\neffectively a k-variable udCSP.\n  The udCSP framework represents constraints with unbounded domains via a\ncollection $\\mathcal{M}$ of unary maps into a finite-domain base language\n$\\Gamma$. We develop an algebraic theory for studying the complexity of\nudCSP$(\\Gamma,\\mathcal{M})$ with a Galois connection based on partial\nmultifunctions.\n  We study three types of maps: unrestricted, one-hot, and monotone. For\nunrestricted maps, the problem is W[1]-hard for all but trivial cases, and for\none-hot maps, the characterization coincides with Marx' FPT dichotomy for\nBoolean Weighted CSPs (Computational Complexity 2005). For the case of monotone\nmaps Mo, we show that the complexity depends on restricted identifies we call\nordered polymorphisms; we identify the \"connector\" polymorphism as the likely\nFPT boundary. We show that its absence implies that udCSP($\\Gamma$,Mo) defines\nall permutations, and the problem is W[1]-hard; while its presence for a binary\nlanguage implies bounded twin-width, and the problem is FPT (Twin-Width IV;\nBonnet et al., JACM 2024). For non-binary languages, where twin-width does not\napply, the polymorphism coincides with a notion of bounded projected grid-rank;\nhowever, we leave the FPT question for this case open."}

The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and\nintrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the\npractical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex\ncalculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such\nas perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence\nor uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and\ncan serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in\nLLM-generated code.

When\nrunning such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the\nalgorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems\naddressing this, which we call \"Quality Control Problems.\" These problems are\nspecified by a (positive, real-valued) \"quality function\" $\\rho$ and a\ndistribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is\n\"high quality,\" meaning its $\\rho$-value is near $1$.

The objective of quality control is thus weaker\nthan either component problem: testing for \"$\\rho(x) \\approx 1$\" or testing if\n$x \\sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.\n  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control\nproblem, where $D \\in \\Delta(\\{0,1\\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D\n,\\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time.

Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart\ngovernance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the\nmost used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological\nmodeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great\nmajority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven\nin operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their\nresults in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the\npresented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better\nunderstanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a\nfoundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities\nmodeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the\nModel-Driven Engineering community."}

While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this\ngeneral intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five\nwidely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines,\ncompilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the\nbug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC\nhas a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage.

The model predicts wavelet coefficients\nconditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which\nare then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a\ncomprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and\narchitectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to\n1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of\nroughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our\nRTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX\n4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on\nhigher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,\nour results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and\neffective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics\napplications."}

Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for\nreal-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes\nwithout requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when\ndownstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL\napproaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs\nduring incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by\ndevising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the\nzero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding\nRecomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple\ntextual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a\nfoundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub\nand compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that\nimproves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two\npopular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total\nof 14 datasets.
