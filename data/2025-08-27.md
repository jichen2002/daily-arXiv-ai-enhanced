TL;DR: 研究提出两种无需真实训练数据的水下3D物体检测方法，合成数据训练的神经网络表现优异但受域偏移影响，模板匹配方法在真实数据中更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下3D物体检测中因真实标注数据获取成本高、难度大而导致的训练数据稀缺问题。

Method: 研究开发并比较了两种无需训练数据的检测范式：基于物理的声呐模拟管道生成合成数据训练神经网络，以及基于几何先验的模板匹配系统。

Result: 神经网络在合成数据上达到98% mAP，但在真实数据上降至40%；模板匹配方法在真实数据上保持83% mAP且无需训练。

Conclusion: 本研究挑战了传统依赖大量真实数据的水下3D物体检测方法，展示了无需真实训练数据的两种替代方案的潜力，为数据稀缺环境下的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileDenseAttn是一种融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的模型，用于高效、高性能且可解释地识别脑肿瘤，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在泛化性、计算效率、可解释性和透明度方面存在局限性，限制了其可信度。MobileDenseAttn旨在克服这些问题。

Method: 引入了MobileDenseAttn，一种融合了MobileNetV2和DenseNet201双流模型的融合模型，通过GradCAM逐步改善特征表示尺度、计算效率和视觉解释。模型使用特征级融合，并在包含6,020个MRI扫描的增强数据集上进行训练。

Result: 在严格的5折交叉验证协议下，MobileDenseAttn提供了99.75%的训练准确率、98.35%的测试准确率和稳定的F1分数（0.9835，95% CI: 0.9743至0.9920）。与基线模型相比，准确率提高了3.67%，训练时间减少了39.3%。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn被定位为一种高效、高性能且可解释的模型，具有成为临床实践中识别脑肿瘤的实用工具的高概率。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs在视觉参考下的事实回忆能力显著下降，内部状态探针能有效标记不可靠回答，提高任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别VLMs在多模态基础中的缺陷，尤其是在视觉参考下其事实回忆能力显著下降的问题。

Method: 通过控制研究，分析VLMs在文本和视觉参考下的表现差异，并利用模型内部状态模式构建探针。

Result: 研究发现，VLMs在视觉参考下的表现比文本参考差一半，且内部状态探针能以92%的准确率标记不可靠回答。应用这些探针可在不重新训练的情况下提高视觉问答任务的覆盖率和降低错误率。

Conclusion: 作者建议解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多模态基础中的系统性缺陷是语言基础的重要方向，并提供了未来研究的建议。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种语义感知的神经重建方法，通过结合语义逻辑和新型正则化技术，显著提升了稀疏图像生成3D模型的性能，实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于稀疏输入中特征不匹配导致的严重辐射模糊问题，提升从稀疏图像生成3D模型的准确性和保真度。

Method: 提出了一种结合基于补丁的语义逻辑与神经隐式表示（如符号距离场和辐射场）的方法，并引入了基于几何基元掩码的新型正则化技术以减少形状模糊。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，该方法将SparseNeuS和VolRecon的平均倒角距离分别降低了44%和20%；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo等密集重建基线的插件，平均误差分别减少了69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入语义感知的神经重建技术，显著提升了稀疏图像生成3D高保真模型的性能，有效减少了形状和辐射模糊问题。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [LSD-3D: Large-Scale 3D Driving Scene Generation with Geometry Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19204)
*Julian Ost,Andrea Ramazzina,Amogh Joshi,Maximilian Bömer,Mario Bijelic,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合代理几何生成与2D图像先验分数蒸馏的方法，直接生成具有准确几何的大规模3D驾驶场景，解决了现有方法在可控性和几何一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经重建方法在场景控制和多样性上受限，而图像或视频扩散模型生成的驾驶数据缺乏几何基础和因果性。

Method: 结合代理几何生成与环境表示，利用学习到的2D图像先验进行分数蒸馏。

Result: 实现了高可控性的大规模3D驾驶场景生成，具有逼真的纹理和结构，且几何一致。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了代理几何生成与环境表示，通过2D图像先验的分数蒸馏，实现了高质量、可控的大规模3D驾驶场景生成，为机器人学习提供了更丰富的训练和测试数据。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

TL;DR: 轻量级深度学习模型组合在非法垃圾填埋场检测任务中表现优异，集成模型达到92.33%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对环境和人类健康构成严重威胁，但手动检测效率低下且缺乏高质量公开数据集。AerialWaste数据集的发布为研究提供了支持。

Method: 使用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等轻量级深度学习模型进行训练和验证，并采用集成模型进一步提升性能。

Result: 集成模型在AerialWaste数据集上实现了92.33%的准确率、92.67%的精确率、92.33%的敏感度、92.41%的F1分数和92.71%的特异性。

Conclusion: 通过集成和融合技术，本研究在非法垃圾填埋场检测任务上取得了高准确率（92.33%）和其他优异指标，证明了轻量级模型组合的有效性。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU框架通过结构-语义统一和多视角对比学习，显著提升了多模态情感分析的性能和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了模态特定的结构依赖和语义不对齐问题，导致性能受限。SSU旨在通过系统整合结构信息和语义对齐来提升多模态表示的质量和解释性。

Method: SSU通过动态构建模态特定图（利用文本的语言学语法和轻量级的文本引导注意力机制）和引入语义锚点（基于全局文本语义）来实现跨模态对齐。此外，采用多视角对比学习目标来增强判别性和语义一致性。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上，SSU实现了最先进的性能，同时显著降低了计算开销。定性分析进一步验证了其解释性和捕捉细微情感模式的能力。

Conclusion: SSU框架通过整合模态特定的结构信息和跨模态语义对齐，显著提升了多模态情感分析的性能，并在减少计算开销的同时保持了高解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个快速、前馈的框架，能从任意姿态的单张面部图像生成高质量3D高斯泼溅模型，速度快1000倍，并支持实时编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在快速生成3D高斯泼溅模型时重建质量不足和速度慢的问题，特别是在单张面部图像输入且姿态任意的情况下。

Method: FastAvatar首先从多视角捕捉的训练数据集中构建3DGS面部“模板”模型，然后通过编码输入面部图像生成身份特定且姿态不变的潜在嵌入，并解码该嵌入以预测模板3DGS模型中每个高斯的结构和外观参数残差。

Result: FastAvatar在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈3DGS方法（如GAGAvatar），且运行速度比单脸优化方法（如FlashAvatar、GaussianAvatars和GASP）快1000倍，同时支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过创新的编码器-解码器网络设计，实现了快速拟合和身份保持，显著提升了重建质量和速度，扩展了3D高斯泼溅在消费和交互系统中的应用范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种适用于紧急场景的移动生物识别系统，采用PolyProtect保护方案，实验证明其在面部和指纹识别中高效且安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人道主义和紧急场景中，生物识别技术能显著提高操作效率，但同时也增加了数据主体的风险。特别是在脆弱环境中，这种风险更为突出。因此，需要一种既能保护隐私又高效的系统。

Method: 论文通过严格制定功能、操作、安全和隐私需求，对生物特征模板保护方案进行了广泛比较分析，最终选择了PolyProtect方法，并对其在面部和指纹识别中的性能进行了评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，PolyProtect在面部和指纹识别中表现出色，具有较高的验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种适用于人道主义紧急场景的移动生物识别系统，采用PolyProtect作为生物特征模板保护方案，并通过实验验证了其在面部和指纹识别中的有效性。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [10] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文主张在下一代视觉基础模型中整合动态关系图以增强显式推理能力，并通过实验验证了其效果，提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉基础模型（FMs）在计算机视觉中占据主导地位，但在需要显式推理实体、角色和时空关系的任务上存在局限性。这种关系能力对于细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析至关重要。

Method: 提出动态关系图作为显式关系接口，通过轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块增强FMs。

Result: 增强FMs的图推理模块提高了细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率，同时实现了内存和硬件效率的优势。

Conclusion: 下一代基础模型（FMs）应整合显式关系接口，即动态关系图（其拓扑和边语义从输入和任务上下文中推断）。通过跨领域证据展示了轻量级、上下文自适应图推理模块对FMs的增强效果，并提出了针对FM图混合体的研究议程。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对不可读车牌的识别挑战，提出了一个包含10,210张图像的新数据集（LPLC数据集），并评估了三种基线模型的性能，F1得分均低于80%，表明任务具有挑战性，需要进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别（ALPR）在处理不可读车牌时面临重大挑战。虽然超分辨率（SR）等重建方法已经出现，但识别这些低质量车牌的核心问题仍未解决。为了优化模型性能和计算效率，图像预处理应选择性地应用于需要增强可读性的情况。

Method: 引入了包含10,210张车辆图像和12,687个标注车牌的新数据集（LPLC数据集），并采用细粒度标注策略，包括车辆和车牌级别的遮挡、四种可读性类别（完美、良好、差和不可读）以及三个类别的字符标签（不包括不可读车牌）。作为基准，提出了一个分类任务，使用三种图像识别网络来确定车牌图像是否足够好、需要超分辨率或完全不可恢复。

Result: 三种基线模型（ViT、ResNet和YOLO）的整体F1得分均低于80%，结合超分辨率和车牌识别方法的分析，突出了任务的难度，并强调了进一步研究的必要性。

Conclusion: 尽管采用了三种基线模型（ViT、ResNet和YOLO），整体F1得分仍低于80%，这表明任务具有挑战性，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一种Specialist-Generalist框架，通过结合轻量级图像分类器和压缩VLM，显著提升皮肤病诊断准确率并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用VLMs在医疗任务中诊断准确性受限以及大模型推理成本高的问题。

Method: CLARIFY结合了轻量级领域训练的图像分类器（Specialist）和压缩的对话式VLM（Generalist），并通过知识图谱检索模块增强其响应。

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上，CLARIFY比基线模型诊断准确率提升18%，同时显存需求和延迟分别降低至少20%和5%。

Conclusion: CLARIFY的Specialist-Generalist框架为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用且强大的范例。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

and 5 million parameters) for the prediction of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) on
face images with arbitrary resolutions and realistic degradations. Submissions
underwent comprehensive evaluations through correlation metrics on a dataset of
in-the-wild face images. This challenge attracted 127 participants, with 1519
final submissions. This report summarizes the methodologies and findings for
advancing the development of practical FIQA approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种上下文感知的零样本异常检测框架，结合时空和语义建模，无需异常样本训练即可检测监控视频中的异常行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测因异常事件的不可预测性和上下文依赖性而具有挑战性，需要一种无需异常样本训练的方法。

Method: 采用混合架构结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型，通过InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 框架能够泛化到复杂环境中未见过的行为，填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理与语义上下文之间的空白。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合时空动态建模和语义上下文理解的新型零样本异常检测框架，有效解决了监控视频中异常检测的挑战。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一种无需人工标注的自监督LiDAR场景流估计框架，通过跨模态标签转移显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景中表现不佳，而监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注，难以扩展。

Method: DoGFlow 利用4D雷达多普勒测量实时生成运动伪标签，并通过动态感知关联和模糊解析传播将其转移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上，DoGFlow显著优于现有自监督方法，仅需10%的标注数据即可达到90%以上的全监督性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow 是一种新型自监督框架，通过跨模态标签转移方法显著提升了LiDAR场景流估计的性能，无需人工标注数据。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

TL;DR: SatSkylines提出了一种结合卫星图像和粗糙几何先验的3D建筑生成方法，解决了现有技术的局限性，并通过大规模数据集验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视图中准确恢复建筑结构，而3D细节化方法则依赖于高度详细的体素输入，无法从简单先验（如立方体）中产生满意结果。

Method: 该方法建模了从插值噪声粗糙先验到详细几何的转换，实现了无需额外计算成本的灵活几何控制。

Result: 通过开发的Skylines-50K数据集和广泛评估，证明了模型的有效性和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines通过结合卫星图像和粗糙几何先验，提出了一种有效的3D建筑生成方法，解决了现有技术在准确性和灵活性上的不足。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: 论文提出检测游戏地图中空间过渡点（STP）的两阶段深度学习流程，并验证了其在低数据场景下的有效性，为AI导航辅助工具提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，玩家依赖视觉线索识别地图过渡点，高效识别这些点对客户端自动映射和评估地图提示展示至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习流程：第一阶段使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，第二阶段通过轻量级MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征进行排序。

Result: 实验表明，全网络微调在数据充足时STP检测效果更优，而仅适配器迁移在低数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更具鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 论文通过定义空间过渡点（STP）检测任务并提出一个两阶段深度学习流程，为未来AI驱动的导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动角色动画方法在复杂影视制作中表现不足，无法满足如细腻角色互动、真实身体动作和动态镜头等需求。

Method: 基于Wan构建的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过实验验证其性能，并与Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等先进模型进行对比。

Result: 实验结果表明，Wan-S2V在表现力和保真度上显著优于现有方法，并成功应用于长视频生成和精确视频唇音同步编辑。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V模型在电影级角色动画中表现出色，显著超越了现有技术如Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman，为复杂影视制作提供了高表现力和高保真度的解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

TL;DR: DeReF框架通过随机特征重组和动态MoE融合，解决了癌症生存分析中的特征组合和信息交互问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在癌症生存分析中存在固定融合方案导致特征组合受限，以及MoE融合中信息交互不足的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion框架（DeReF），包括随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块，并在模态解耦模块中引入了区域交叉注意力网络。

Result: 在内部肝癌数据集和三个TCGA公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了DeReF的有效性。

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过随机特征重组策略和动态MoE融合模块，有效解决了现有方法在癌症生存分析中的信息交互和特征组合多样性问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和预测性能。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个视频对象移除框架，专注于处理对象副作用（如阴影、反射），通过合成数据和扩散变压器模型实现高效移除，并在新基准ROSE-Bench上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（如阴影、反射等）时因缺乏配对视频数据而效果不佳。

Method: ROSE基于扩散变压器构建视频修复模型，通过合成数据生成和额外监督（如差分掩码）定位并消除对象相关区域及其副作用。

Result: 实验结果表明，ROSE在多种副作用移除任务中表现优异，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: ROSE框架在视频对象移除及其副作用处理方面表现出色，优于现有模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 提出OwlCap模型和HMD-270K数据集，通过数据构建和优化方法解决视频字幕中的运动-细节不平衡问题，在基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，导致字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：通过Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF)和Fine-Grained Examination (FGE)两阶段流程构建HMD-270K数据集。2) 优化层面：引入基于Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)的Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)，通过unit-to-set匹配和双向验证增强字幕的完整性和准确性。

Result: OwlCap在细节关注的VDC（+4.2 Acc）和运动关注的DREAM-1K（+4.6 F1）基准测试中显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: OwlCap模型和HMD-270K数据集的发布将促进视频字幕研究社区的进步。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Conclusion: 提出的聚类特征空间表示学习方法在各种主流检测框架上均显著提升了甲骨文检测性能。

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间域SNR先验方法在分离跨通道干扰和放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面存在局限，需改进。

Method: 提出了Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer (FAST)和Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)瓶颈模块，结合频域SNR先验和U型架构，通过分解特征到幅度和相位谱来优化通道调制。

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集上训练的SFormer，PSNR提升了3.1 dB，SSIM提高了0.08。

Conclusion: SFormer通过结合频域SNR先验和注意力机制，成功提升了水下图像增强的性能，在PSNR和SSIM指标上优于现有方法，有效恢复了水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度。

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Conclusion: 通过分层时空分割网络（\ourmodel）和时空交叉扫描（STCS）模块，本研究成功提升了左心室心内膜分割的准确性，从而改善了射血分数（EF）的估计精度。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: FPS是一种新型领域适应框架，通过优化决策边界而非微调特征编码器，实现了高效、可解释的迁移学习，适用于多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的无监督领域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和扩展性不足的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有领域不变的几何模式，表明领域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出了一种名为FPS的新型领域适应框架，通过利用预训练模型特征空间中的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界，同时保持特征编码器冻结。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS表现优于或与最先进方法相当，且能高效扩展到多模态大模型，适用于蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域。

Conclusion: FPS提供了一种简单、有效且通用的迁移学习范式，尤其在领域适应任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Conclusion: 所提出的混合深度学习框架通过结合定制的InceptionV3、LSTM架构和基于集成的特征选择策略，显著提升了HAR系统的性能，支持在边缘设备上的实时部署。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限性，3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在复杂纹理和全局变形建模上表现不足。

Method: 提出了ColorGS框架，结合空间自适应颜色编码和增强变形模型，包括彩色高斯基元和增强变形模型(EDM)。

Result: 在DaVinci机器人手术视频和基准数据集上，ColorGS实现了PSNR 39.85（比现有3DGS方法高1.5）和SSIM 97.25%，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS在手术场景重建中实现了高保真度与计算效率的平衡，为术中指导和AR/VR应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在类别不平衡数据集上训练神经网络时，模型倾向于偏向多数类别而忽视少数类别的问题。

Method: 提出了类特定洪水正则化方法，根据类别频率为每个类别分配特定的洪水水平，以抑制多数类别的过拟合并促进少数类别的学习。

Result: 在图像分类任务中验证了该方法的有效性，相比传统洪水正则化，显著提高了少数类别的分类性能并改善了整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 类特定洪水正则化通过在类别级别应用洪水技术，有效抑制了多数类别的过拟合，同时保证了少数类别的充分学习，从而在整体上提高了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

TL;DR: 研究分析了水下目标检测中类别性能差异的原因，提出改进定位模块和优化数据分布的建议，以提高表现不佳物种的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测在监测海洋生态系统中至关重要，但面临图像质量下降、类别分布不平衡和独特视觉特征等挑战。研究旨在揭示导致特定类别性能差异的因素，并系统性改进表现不佳的海洋物种检测。

Method: 使用YOLO11和TIDE对DUO数据集进行定位和分类分析，分离检测任务以研究扇贝类别的表现不佳问题。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最具挑战性的阶段，与数据量无关。分类实验显示即使数据平衡，精度差距仍然存在，表明存在内在特征挑战。

Conclusion: 为了提高水下目标检测的性能，特别是对于表现不佳的物种，应优先关注算法改进，尤其是在定位模块中。数据分布应根据精度或召回率的优先级进行平衡或不平衡处理。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Motivation: 传统课程学习和锐度感知最小化方法在平坦区域难以有效评估样本难度，导致训练效果受限。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 论文提出了对抗性难度度量（ADM），通过测量原始样本和对抗样本之间的归一化损失差距来量化样本难度，并将其与课程学习和锐度感知最小化结合。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个任务中优于现有课程学习和平坦性感知训练策略。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合课程学习（CL）和锐度感知最小化（SAM）的新方法，通过引入对抗性难度度量（ADM）动态评估样本难度，从而在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域泛化任务中取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

Conclusion: PseudoMapTrainer通过利用未标记传感器数据生成的伪标签，首次实现了无需地面真实高精度地图的在线地图模型训练，为地理多样性不足的地区提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Result: 创建了CAD-VGDrawing数据集，实验证明Drawing2CAD在生成参数化CAD模型方面有效。

Conclusion: 通过Drawing2CAD框架，成功实现了从2D工程图到参数化CAD模型的自动生成，保留了几何精度和设计意图。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Method: 采用旋转不平衡质量诱导周期性振动运动，并结合运动补偿管道去除注入的运动，生成干净、运动校正的事件。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能够可靠地恢复运动参数，并在图像重建和边缘检测方面优于无运动诱导的事件感知。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入简单的旋转不平衡质量来诱导周期性振动运动，结合运动补偿管道，能够持续生成事件并提高下游感知任务的性能。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

Conclusion: 提出的路由器门控跨模态特征融合方法显著提高了在噪声环境中的音频-视觉语音识别（AVSR）性能，通过动态调整音频和视觉特征的权重，使模型能够更好地适应音频质量变化。

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

Motivation: 现有HOI基准测试（如HICO-DET）与现代VLMs的生成性质不匹配，其评估协议要求与标注的HOI类别完全匹配，可能导致有效预测被错误惩罚。

Method: 引入一个新的基准测试，将HOI检测重新表述为多答案多选择题任务，每个问题仅包括真实正面选项和一组精心挑选的负面选项以减少歧义。

Result: 新基准测试避免了有效预测被惩罚的问题，为VLMs和HOI方法提供了直接比较的平台。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个新的基准测试，将HOI检测重新定义为多答案选择题任务，以避免对有效预测的惩罚，并首次实现了VLMs和HOI方法的直接比较。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised

achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家森林清单（NFI）是森林信息的主要来源，但维护这些清单需要劳动密集型的现场活动。结合机器学习的遥感方法为更频繁和大规模更新NFI提供了机会。

Method: 本研究系统性地探讨了深度特征如何利用少量标注数据提高荷兰树种分类的准确性。数据方面，我们使用Google Earth Engine从Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5卫星数据和SRTM数据中提取时间序列数据。

Result: 结果表明，对公开可用的遥感时间序列基础模型进行微调，在荷兰NFI分类中表现优于现有最佳方法，准确率提高了高达10%。

Conclusion: 通过利用公开可用的卫星数据和预训练模型，该方法显著提高了分类准确性，并有效补充了现有的森林库存流程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种先验引导的视频级回归方法，通过可扩展区间选择和协同优化框架，显著提升了微表情分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的微表情分析方法大多依赖固定窗口大小的窗口级分类，难以捕捉微表情的复杂时间动态。尽管近期方法采用了视频级回归框架，但区间解码仍依赖手动预定义的窗口方法。

Method: 引入了一种可扩展的区间选择策略，综合考虑了微表情的时间演化、持续时间和类别分布特征，以及一个协同优化框架，使定位和识别任务共享参数（除分类头外）。

Result: 在CAS(ME)$^3$和SAMMLV数据集上分别达到了0.0562和0.2000的STRS分数。

Conclusion: 提出的先验引导视频级回归方法在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在微表情分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Result: 几何指标能够有效复制专家评分，验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的定量框架通过图像处理技术，有效提升了微外科吻合术评估的客观性、可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

TL;DR: A novel video stabilization method adapts models per input video using low-level cues and targeted adaptation, improving stability and quality while maintaining full-frame synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of robust generalization in pixel-level synthesis video stabilization due to diverse motion profiles and visual content.

Method: The approach uses low-level visual cues, a jerk localization module, and targeted adaptation strategy to focus on high-jerk segments for efficient stabilization.

Result: Significant performance gains with a single adaptation pass, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in both qualitative and quantitative terms.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances video stabilization by adapting models to each input video at test time, improving stability and visual quality while maintaining full-frame synthesis.

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Motivation: 解决现有去偏方法独立处理视觉和文本模态导致的跨模态错位和公平性差距问题。

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，构建近似正交的文本锚点，并通过超网络生成实例感知的视觉提示。

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内外设置下均实现了最优的公平性和准确性。

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过多模态提示学习框架，在医疗影像诊断中实现了跨模态表征的联合去偏和对齐，显著提升了公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出DQEN方法，通过增强对象和交互查询提升HOI检测性能，在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型依赖随机初始化的查询，导致模糊表示限制模型效果。人类在HOI类别中固定，而对象及其交互可变，因此需增强对象和交互查询。

Method: 通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，并设计交互语义融合模块利用CLIP模型提升HOI候选，同时引入辅助预测单元改善交互特征表示。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 提出的双查询增强网络（DQEN）在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上实现了具有竞争力的性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Conclusion: 本文为区分群体和单个行人提供了一个初步框架，并建立了空间利用和行为模式的综合分析指标，为后续行人模拟和空间设计验证奠定了基础。

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Motivation: 监测珊瑚礁在大空间尺度上仍是一个未解决的挑战，这对于评估生态系统健康和指导保护工作至关重要。无人机航空图像提供了广阔的空间覆盖，但其有限的分辨率难以可靠地区分细尺度类别（如珊瑚形态型）。同时，在大空间范围内获取像素级注释成本高且劳动密集，限制了基于深度学习的航空图像分割方法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种可扩展、成本效益高的方法，用于高分辨率珊瑚礁监测，结合了低成本数据收集、弱监督深度学习和多尺度遥感技术。

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Motivation: 现有文献通常将风格驱动和主题驱动的生成视为两个独立的任务，导致两者之间存在明显的对立。本文认为这两个目标可以通过内容和风格的解耦与重组统一起来。

Method: 1. 构建大规模的三元组数据集；2. 引入解耦学习方案，包括风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练；3. 结合风格奖励学习范式（SRL）以进一步提升模型性能；4. 发布USO-Bench基准。

Result: USO在风格相似性和主题一致性两个维度上均达到了开源模型中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: USO模型通过统一风格和主题优化的框架，在风格相似性和主题一致性方面均达到了开源模型中的最先进性能。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAG在Document VQA中显著提升性能，文本和视觉检索均优于基线，检索和重排序是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Document VQA系统在处理多页文档时存在内存消耗大的问题，而RAG提供了一种高效的选择性检索和生成答案的方法。

Method: 研究通过不同的检索变体（基于OCR令牌的文本检索和无OCR的纯视觉检索）在多模型和基准上系统评估RAG在Document VQA中的影响。

Result: 在多页数据集MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA上，文本检索变体比基线方法提升高达+22.5 ANLS，视觉检索变体提升+5.0 ANLS且无需文本提取。

Conclusion: 通过系统评估，研究发现将检索增强生成（RAG）引入文档视觉问答（Document VQA）能显著提升性能，特别是在多页数据集上。文本检索和视觉检索均优于基线方法，且检索和重排序组件是性能提升的关键。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

TL;DR: GRAS基准和GRAS Bias Score用于量化视觉语言模型在人口统计学上的偏见，测试显示现有模型偏见严重，评估方法需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLMs）在现实世界应用中的普及，理解其人口统计学偏见变得至关重要。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准和GRAS Bias Score，用于评估VLMs在性别、种族、年龄和肤色方面的偏见，并测试了五种最先进的VLMs。

Result: 研究发现VLMs存在显著的偏见，表现最好的模型GRAS Bias Score仅为2/100。同时指出，评估偏见时需考虑问题的多种表述形式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中评估和减少人口统计学偏见的紧迫性，并提出了GRAS基准和GRAS Bias Score作为量化工具。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的屋顶平面分割方法存在三个主要问题：非真正的端到端、边缘区域特征判别性低、平面几何特征考虑不足。RoofSeg旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RoofSeg网络采用基于Transformer的编码器-解码器框架，利用可学习的平面查询和边缘感知掩模模块（EAMM）来增强边缘区域的判别能力，并通过自适应权重策略和平面几何损失优化网络训练。

Result: RoofSeg在LiDAR点云数据上实现了真正的端到端屋顶平面分割，显著提高了边缘区域的准确性。

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络通过结合边缘感知模块和自适应权重策略，有效解决了当前深度学习在屋顶平面分割中的三个主要问题，实现了真正的端到端分割，并提高了边缘区域的准确性。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

TL;DR: MDN 模型结合荧光显微镜和深度学习，高效检测血液中的微塑料，准确率达92%，为人类健康研究提供新工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球塑料污染日益严重，微塑料对环境和人类健康的危害日益凸显，亟需一种高效、准确的检测方法。

Method: 该研究结合了荧光显微镜、尼罗红染料染色和深度学习技术，通过卷积神经网络对血液样本中的微塑料进行定位和计数。

Result: MDN 模型在276张尼罗红染色的荧光血液图像数据集上表现优异，准确率为92%，IoU为87.4%，F1分数为92.1%，精确度为90.6%，召回率为93.7%。

Conclusion: MicroDetect-Net (MDN) 模型在检测微塑料方面表现出高效性，准确率达到92%，为未来在人类血液样本中的应用提供了初步数据支持。

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

TL;DR: ProPy利用CLIP模型改进PRVR任务，通过多粒度事件语义交互设计，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRVR方法主要依赖单模态特征处理，而强大的预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在该领域尚未充分探索。为此，作者提出ProPy，旨在填补这一空白。

Method: ProPy基于CLIP模型进行系统架构调整，设计了Prompt Pyramid结构和Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism，以捕捉多粒度事件的语义相关性。

Result: ProPy在三个公共数据集上表现优异，显著超越现有模型。

Conclusion: ProPy通过创新的Prompt Pyramid结构和Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism，在多粒度事件语义交互方面取得了显著进展，实现了PRVR任务上的SOTA性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在评估血流动力学生物标志物（如壁剪切应力）时面临的数据稀缺问题，尤其是在冠状动脉领域，尚未充分研究如何利用大规模几何模型数据集提升小规模临床数据的分析效果。

Method: 通过计算热核签名（一种基于拉普拉斯特征向量的形状特征）创建自监督目标，利用8449个3D血管几何模型进行预训练，并在49名患者的小规模临床试验数据上进行验证。

Result: 实验证明，基于大规模几何模型数据集学习的表示能够显著提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力的区域分割准确性（低、中、高时间平均壁剪切应力）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用大量几何血管模型数据集进行自监督预训练可以有效提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力评估的准确性，即使在有限临床数据下也能显著改善分割效果。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割自动化面临标注数据集稀缺和标注成本高的问题，因此需要开发数据高效的方法。

Method: 使用轻量级UNet++架构和拓扑感知损失函数，训练于从每份手稿仅三页标注数据中提取的小块图像。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上，识别准确率提升了200%，行交集并集提高了75%，并在DIVA-HisDB基线检测任务中达到或超过最佳成绩。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合轻量级UNet++架构和拓扑感知损失函数，显著提高了历史文档文本行分割的准确性和数据效率，同时仅需少量标注数据。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型对数值单位敏感但忽略实际物理意义，导致3D感知能力弱，阻碍了3D视觉定位任务的性能。

Method: 1. 3D文本增强（3DTE）预处理方法，通过增加文本查询中距离描述符的多样性来增强不同单位之间的映射关系理解。2. 文本引导几何增强（TGE）模块，将基本文本特征投影到几何一致空间，进一步强化3D文本信息。

Conclusion: 论文提出的3DTE和TGE方法显著提升了单目3D视觉定位任务的性能，特别是在远距离场景中实现了11.94%的准确率提升。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: WEF-PE是一种基于椭圆函数的位置编码方法，解决了传统编码在二维空间中的不足，显著提升了ViT模型在多个任务中的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统的一维位置编码破坏了图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法有效利用空间邻近先验。

Method: 提出了Weierstrass椭圆函数位置编码（WEF-PE），利用椭圆函数的双重周期性和非线性几何特性，直接编码二维坐标，并通过代数加法公式推导相对位置信息。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和VTAB-1k等基准测试中，WEF-PE表现优异，如ViT-Tiny在CIFAR-100上达到63.78%的准确率，ViT-Base达到93.28%。

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过椭圆函数的自然复域表示，有效解决了传统位置编码在二维空间中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了优异结果。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Method: 采用自回归模型单独生成顶点，减少令牌数量至现有最紧凑标记器的约23%。然后利用双向变换器通过捕获顶点间关系并构建定义网格面的邻接矩阵，一步完成网格。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在网格生成速度上比现有最先进方法快8倍以上，同时生成更高质量的网格。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种高效的框架，通过分别处理顶点和面来生成艺术网格，显著减少了冗余。实验结果表明，该方法在网格生成速度上比现有最先进方法快8倍以上，同时生成更高质量的网格。

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中每个属性需要独立训练滑块导致的参数冗余和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 通过将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的、语义上有意义的属性方向，训练一个轻量级的 All-in-One Slider 模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够实现精确且可扩展的属性操控，支持零样本操控和多个属性的组合。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider 提供了一种高效且可扩展的方法，用于在文本到图像生成中进行多属性操控，显著优于现有方法，并支持真实图像的应用。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频虚拟人模型虽能生成流畅动画，但缺乏对情感、意图或上下文深层次语义的理解，仅依赖低级音频节奏同步。

Method: 1. 利用多模态大语言模型生成结构化文本条件，提供高级语义指导。2. 引入Multimodal DiT架构和Pseudo Last Frame设计，有效融合多模态输入并减少模态间冲突。

Result: 模型在唇同步准确性、视频质量、运动自然度和文本提示语义一致性等指标上表现领先，并能扩展到多人及非人类角色的复杂场景。

Conclusion: OmniHuman-1.5通过结合多模态大语言模型和创新的Multimodal DiT架构，成功生成了不仅物理逼真，而且在语义和情感上连贯的角色动画，且在复杂场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅提供静态分析或需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解，无法满足纳米尺度动态生长表征的需求。

Method: VFTrack集成了手工或深度学习特征检测器与匹配器，通过粒子跟踪框架对CNT微柱生长进行运动学分析，并利用13,540条手动标注轨迹系统评估了ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器的最佳组合。

Result: VFTrack将运动向量分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，实现了异质区域生长率的计算和CNT柱形态演化的重建，ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器的组合表现出色（F1-score 0.78，α-score 0.89）。

Conclusion: VFTrack框架通过自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管（CNT）粒子，实现了纳米材料动态生长的实时表征，填补了物理模型与实验观察之间的差距，为CNT合成的实时优化提供了可能。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Motivation: 现有视频分割模型在无提示场景下表现分散，需任务特定模型或流程，亟需统一解决方案。

Method: AUSM基于状态空间模型，采用固定大小的空间状态，支持任意长度视频流，并通过并行训练框架加速。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AUSM优于现有通用流式视频分割方法，训练速度提升高达2.5倍。

Conclusion: AUSM通过自回归掩码预测统一了提示和无提示视频分割任务，显著提升了训练速度和性能。

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench旨在成为评估和推动动态3D场景风格化渲染研究的宝贵资源，Style4D框架在4D风格化方面表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进步，但通过语言控制操纵3D资产的姿势仍具有挑战性。

Method: 将问题分解为两步：修改强大的图像生成器以创建基于输入图像和文本指令的目标图像；通过多视角姿势优化步骤将网格与目标图像对齐，引入自注意力重连机制（RSActrl）和解耦源结构与姿势。

Result: 在多样化的3D对象和自由形式文本提示上展示了Articulate3D的有效性，用户研究中85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D通过语言控制成功操纵3D资产的姿势，同时保持网格的原始身份，定量评估和用户研究证实其优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Conclusion: VoxHammer方法在保持未编辑区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法，为高质量编辑配对数据的合成奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Abstract: Radiance fields have revolutionized photo-realistic 3D scene visualization by
enabling high-fidelity reconstruction of complex environments, making them an
ideal match for light field displays. However, integrating these technologies
presents significant computational challenges, as light field displays require
multiple high-resolution renderings from slightly shifted viewpoints, while
radiance fields rely on computationally intensive volume rendering. In this
paper, we propose a unified and efficient framework for real-time radiance
field rendering on light field displays. Our method supports a wide range of
radiance field representations, including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and
Sparse Voxels, within a shared architecture based on a single-pass plane
sweeping strategy and caching of shared, non-directional components. The
framework generalizes across different scene formats without retraining, and
avoids redundant computation across views. We further demonstrate a real-time
interactive application on a Looking Glass display, achieving 200+ FPS at 512p
across 45 views, enabling seamless, immersive 3D interaction. On standard
benchmarks, our method achieves up to 22x speedup compared to independently
rendering each view, while preserving image quality.

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor

representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each

constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments

Conclusion: PanoHair 通过知识蒸馏和生成模型，显著提高了头发合成的效率和真实性，为数字人创建提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

Conclusion: 优化的INPC管线实现了训练速度提升25%、渲染速度提升2倍、VRAM使用减少20%，同时略微提升了图像质量。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

Motivation: 离线强化学习在自动驾驶规划策略训练中具有潜力，但现实驾驶日志中的极端数据不平衡导致策略脆弱且不安全。

Method: 研究了六种不同的关键性加权方案，分为三类：基于启发式、基于不确定性和基于行为。这些方案在两个时间尺度（单个时间步和完整场景）上进行了评估，并训练了七个目标条件保守Q学习（CQL）代理。

Result: 所有数据整理方法均显著优于基线，其中基于模型不确定性的数据驱动整理将碰撞率降低了近三倍（从16.0%降至5.5%）。

Conclusion: 智能非均匀采样是构建安全可靠自动驾驶代理的关键组成部分，为离线强化学习中的数据整理提供了全面框架。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for
training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world
driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane
scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe
policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address
this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data
curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich
samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are
categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and
behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual
timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based
architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our
results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the
baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal
achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate
by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear
trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while
scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a
comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that
intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and
reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Automating complex tasks using robotic systems requires skills for planning,
control and execution. This paper proposes a complete robotic system for
maintenance automation, which can automate disassembly and assembly operations
under environmental uncertainties (e.g. deviations between prior plan
information). The cognition of the robotic system is based on a planning
approach (using CAD and RGBD data) and includes a method to interpret a
symbolic plan and transform it to a set of executable robot instructions. The
complete system is experimentally evaluated using real-world applications. This
work shows the first step to transfer these theoretical results into a

Abstract: The research and development of intelligent automation solutions is a
ground-breaking point for the factory of the future. A promising and
challenging mission is the use of autonomous robot systems to automate tasks in
the field of maintenance. For this purpose, the robot system must be able to
plan autonomously the different manipulation tasks and the corresponding paths.
Basic requirements are the development of algorithms with a low computational
complexity and the possibility to deal with environmental uncertainties. In
this work, an approach is presented, which is especially suited to solve the
problem of maintenance automation. For this purpose, offline data from CAD is
combined with online data from an RGBD vision system via a probabilistic
filter, to compensate uncertainties from offline data. For planning the
different tasks, a method is explained, which use a symbolic description,
founded on a novel sampling-based method to compute the disassembly space. For
path planning we use global state-of-the art algorithms with a method that
allows the adaption of the exploration stepsize in order to reduce the planning
time. Every method is experimentally validated and discussed.

Abstract: Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have exhibited remarkable
prowess across various cognitive tasks using extensive training data. However,
the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as
highpower consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in
SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these
issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots
by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning
enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events.
By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic
environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance.
This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using
neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights
from spatial cells such as place and grid cells. By integrating these models,
we aim to enable online associative learning for spatial tasks in real-time
scenarios, bridging the gap between biological spatial cognition and robotics
for advancements in autonomous systems.

Motivation: 导航标志和地图（如平面图和街道地图）在人类环境中广泛使用，但机器人系统很少利用这些资源。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: SignLoc首先从输入地图中提取导航图，然后采用概率观测模型将检测到的标志的方向和位置线索与图匹配，通过蒙特卡洛框架实现鲁棒的拓扑语义定位。

Result: 在多样大规模环境（大学校园、购物中心和医院综合体）中的实验结果表明，SignLoc在仅观察一到两个标志后即可可靠地定位机器人。

Conclusion: SignLoc通过利用导航标志在公开地图（如平面图和OpenStreetMap）上实现了无需先验传感器建图的机器人全局定位，实验证明其在多样大规模环境中表现可靠。

Abstract: Navigation signs and maps, such as floor plans and street maps, are widely
available and serve as ubiquitous aids for way-finding in human environments.
Yet, they are rarely used by robot systems. This paper presents SignLoc, a
global localization method that leverages navigation signs to localize the
robot on publicly available maps -- specifically floor plans and OpenStreetMap
(OSM) graphs -- without prior sensor-based mapping. SignLoc first extracts a
navigation graph from the input map. It then employs a probabilistic
observation model to match directional and locational cues from the detected
signs to the graph, enabling robust topo-semantic localization within a Monte
Carlo framework. We evaluated SignLoc in diverse large-scale environments: part
of a university campus, a shopping mall, and a hospital complex. Experimental
results show that SignLoc reliably localizes the robot after observing only one
to two signs.

Result: 仿真研究表明，在A-Space中规划比基线方法任务成功率提高了84.6%。在真实机器人系统上的验证展示了流畅的移动操纵，涉及17种不同情境下的七种刚性和铰接对象，以及长达14个顺序步骤的长时域任务。

Conclusion: 该研究通过将场景运动学建模整合到规划实体中，而非编码特定任务约束，提出了一种可扩展且通用的复杂机器人操纵方法。

Abstract: We present a Sequential Mobile Manipulation Planning (SMMP) framework that
can solve long-horizon multi-step mobile manipulation tasks with coordinated
whole-body motion, even when interacting with articulated objects. By
abstracting environmental structures as kinematic models and integrating them
with the robot's kinematics, we construct an Augmented Configuration Apace
(A-Space) that unifies the previously separate task constraints for navigation
and manipulation, while accounting for the joint reachability of the robot
base, arm, and manipulated objects. This integration facilitates efficient
planning within a tri-level framework: a task planner generates symbolic action
sequences to model the evolution of A-Space, an optimization-based motion
planner computes continuous trajectories within A-Space to achieve desired
configurations for both the robot and scene elements, and an intermediate plan
refinement stage selects action goals that ensure long-horizon feasibility. Our
simulation studies first confirm that planning in A-Space achieves an 84.6\%
higher task success rate compared to baseline methods. Validation on real
robotic systems demonstrates fluid mobile manipulation involving (i) seven
types of rigid and articulated objects across 17 distinct contexts, and (ii)
long-horizon tasks of up to 14 sequential steps. Our results highlight the
significance of modeling scene kinematics into planning entities, rather than
encoding task-specific constraints, offering a scalable and generalizable
approach to complex robotic manipulation.

challenge for engineering automotive DTs. Currently, the only DT architectural
standard is the one defined in ISO 23247. Though not developed for automotive
systems, it is one of the few feasible starting points for automotive DTs. In
this work, we investigate the suitability of the ISO 23247 reference
architecture for developing automotive DTs. Through the case study of
developing an Adaptive Cruise Control DT for a 1/10\textsuperscript{th}-scale
autonomous vehicle, we identify some strengths and limitations of the reference

Abstract: As the embodiment gap between a robot and a human narrows, new opportunities
arise to leverage datasets of humans interacting with their surroundings for
robot learning. We propose a novel technique for training sensorimotor policies
with reinforcement learning by imitating predictive models of human motions.
Our key insight is that the motion of keypoints on human-inspired robot
end-effectors closely mirrors the motion of corresponding human body keypoints.
This enables us to use a model trained to predict future motion on human data
\emph{zero-shot} on robot data. We train sensorimotor policies to track the
predictions of such a model, conditioned on a history of past robot states,
while optimizing a relatively sparse task reward. This approach entirely
bypasses gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses, which
limit existing methods from fully leveraging the scale and diversity of modern
human-scene interaction datasets. Empirically, we find that our approach can
work across robots and tasks, outperforming existing baselines by a large
margin. In addition, we find that tracking a human motion model can substitute
for carefully designed dense rewards and curricula in manipulation tasks. Code,

Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in
static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often
with limited sensor diversity and restricted temporal span. These conditions
fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real farmland, including illumination
changes, crop growth variation, and natural disturbances. As a result, models
trained on such data often lack robustness and generalization when applied to
real-world field scenarios. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a novel
robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture
the dynamic conditions of real-world agricultural environments. Our platform
integrates multiple sensors and enables remote, time-synchronized acquisition
of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, supporting efficient and repeatable
long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages.
We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the
AgriChrono dataset, highlighting the difficulty of reconstruction in real-world
field environments and demonstrating its value as a research asset for
advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions. The code and dataset

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code

Conclusion: HyperTASR通过动态调制场景表示，显著提升了机器人操作任务中的学习效率和表现，更接近人类的自适应感知能力。

Abstract: Effective policy learning for robotic manipulation requires scene
representations that selectively capture task-relevant environmental features.
Current approaches typically employ task-agnostic representation extraction,
failing to emulate the dynamic perceptual adaptation observed in human
cognition. We present HyperTASR, a hypernetwork-driven framework that modulates
scene representations based on both task objectives and the execution phase.
Our architecture dynamically generates representation transformation parameters
conditioned on task specifications and progression state, enabling
representations to evolve contextually throughout task execution. This approach
maintains architectural compatibility with existing policy learning frameworks
while fundamentally reconfiguring how visual features are processed. Unlike
methods that simply concatenate or fuse task embeddings with task-agnostic
representations, HyperTASR establishes computational separation between
task-contextual and state-dependent processing paths, enhancing learning
efficiency and representational quality. Comprehensive evaluations in both
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate substantial performance
improvements across different representation paradigms. Through ablation
studies and attention visualization, we confirm that our approach selectively
prioritizes task-relevant scene information, closely mirroring human adaptive
perception during manipulation tasks. The project website is at

Motivation: 解决敏捷无人机控制中的动态机动问题，如powerloops，这些任务难以用人工设计的奖励函数来形式化。

Result: REC方法达到了88.4%的成型奖励性能，而标准Preference PPO仅为55.2%。

Conclusion: PbRL（基于偏好的强化学习）在捕捉复杂、以人为中心的目标方面表现出色，无论是在物理还是模拟领域。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) enables agents to learn
control policies without requiring manually designed reward functions, making
it well-suited for tasks where objectives are difficult to formalize or
inherently subjective. Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging
problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of
precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone
control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops.
Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we
propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward
learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability.
Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2%
with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully
transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers
where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a
representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight
the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement
with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in
capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated
domains.

Abstract: Designing robotic systems to act autonomously in unforeseen environments is a
challenging task. This work presents a novel approach to use formal
verification, specifically Statistical Model Checking (SMC), to verify system
properties of autonomous robots at design-time. We introduce an extension of
the SCXML format, designed to model system components including both Robot
Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and Behavior Tree (BT) features. Further, we
contribute Autonomous Systems to Formal Models (AS2FM), a tool to translate the
full system model into JANI. The use of JANI, a standard format for
quantitative model checking, enables verification of system properties with
off-the-shelf SMC tools. We demonstrate the practical usability of AS2FM both
in terms of applicability to real-world autonomous robotic control systems, and
in terms of verification runtime scaling. We provide a case study, where we
successfully identify problems in a ROS 2-based robotic manipulation use case
that is verifiable in less than one second using consumer hardware.
Additionally, we compare to the state of the art and demonstrate that our
method is more comprehensive in system feature support, and that the
verification runtime scales linearly with the size of the model, instead of
exponentially.

Abstract: Autonomous control of the laparoscope in robot-assisted Minimally Invasive
Surgery (MIS) has received considerable research interest due to its potential
to improve surgical safety. Despite progress in pixel-level Image-Based Visual
Servoing (IBVS) control, the requirement of continuous visibility and the
existence of complex disturbances, such as parameterization error, measurement
noise, and uncertainties of payloads, could degrade the surgeon's visual
experience and compromise procedural safety. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes VisionSafeEnhanced Visual Predictive Control (VPC), a robust and
uncertainty-adaptive framework for autonomous laparoscope control that
guarantees Field of View (FoV) safety under uncertainty. Firstly, Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) is utilized to perform hybrid (deterministic +
stochastic) quantification of operational uncertainties including residual
model uncertainties, stochastic uncertainties, and external disturbances. Based
on uncertainty quantification, a novel safety aware trajectory optimization
framework with probabilistic guarantees is proposed, where a
uncertainty-adaptive safety Control Barrier Function (CBF) condition is given
based on uncertainty propagation, and chance constraints are simultaneously
formulated based on probabilistic approximation. This uncertainty aware
formulation enables adaptive control effort allocation, minimizing unnecessary
camera motion while maintaining robustness. The proposed method is validated
through comparative simulations and experiments on a commercial surgical robot
platform (MicroPort MedBot Toumai) performing a sequential multi-target lymph
node dissection. Compared with baseline methods, the framework maintains
near-perfect target visibility (>99.9%), reduces tracking e

the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人在运动生成中行为相似性和适当性的挑战，以及跨体现适应性的缺乏问题。

Method: 提出了HuBE，一个双层闭环框架，结合机器人状态、目标姿势和上下文情境生成类人行为，并构建了HPose数据集和支持骨缩放的数据增强策略。

Result: 在多个商业平台上进行的全面评估显示，HuBE在运动相似性、行为适当性和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: HuBE框架通过整合机器人状态、目标姿势和上下文情境，显著提升了人形机器人运动生成的行为相似性和适当性，为跨异构人形机器人的可转移和类人行为执行奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Achieving both behavioral similarity and appropriateness in human-like motion
generation for humanoid robot remains an open challenge, further compounded by
the lack of cross-embodiment adaptability. To address this problem, we propose
HuBE, a bi-level closed-loop framework that integrates robot state, goal poses,
and contextual situations to generate human-like behaviors, ensuring both
behavioral similarity and appropriateness, and eliminating structural
mismatches between motion generation and execution. To support this framework,
we construct HPose, a context-enriched dataset featuring fine-grained
situational annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a bone scaling-based data
augmentation strategy that ensures millimeter-level compatibility across
heterogeneous humanoid robots. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple commercial
platforms demonstrate that HuBE significantly improves motion similarity,
behavioral appropriateness, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art
baselines, establishing a solid foundation for transferable and human-like
behavior execution across diverse humanoid robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NRTrans框架通过RSL和反馈微调，解决了LLM生成机器人控制程序中的错误问题，提升了轻量级LLM的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LLM直接生成可执行程序，但由于LLM的不一致性和任务的高复杂性，导致大量编程错误，尤其是轻量级LLM效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种自然-机器人语言翻译框架（NRTrans），包括RSL语言、编译器及调试器，通过反馈微调LLM生成的程序直至通过验证。

Result: 实验表明，NRTrans在多种LLM和任务中优于现有方法，并显著提高了轻量级LLM的成功率。

Conclusion: NRTrans框架通过引入Robot Skill Language（RSL）及其编译器和调试器，显著提升了轻量级LLM在机器人控制程序生成中的正确性和有效性，实验证明了其优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics
to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied
intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt
design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user
tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and
the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to
tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly
undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.
This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)
provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)
enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based
fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is
proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,
bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the
RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by
the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until
being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the
LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,
significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.
Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range
of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.

TL;DR: DELIVER 是一个基于自然语言指令的多机器人协作取送框架，通过空间分解和中继规划实现高效协调，实验验证了其可扩展性和低工作负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多机器人系统在自然语言指令下的协作取送问题，实现可扩展且无碰撞的实时协调。

Method: DELIVER 整合了自然语言理解、空间分解、中继规划和运动执行，通过 Voronoi 分割定义机器人操作区域，计算最优中继点，并使用有限状态机控制机器人行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，DELIVER 在不同团队规模下保持一致的使命成本，同时将单机器人工作负载减少高达 55%，且中继代理数量在团队规模增大时保持较低水平。

Conclusion: DELIVER 的模块化和可扩展架构为语言指导的多机器人协调提供了新的解决方案，推动了信息物理系统集成的边界。

Abstract: We present DELIVER (Directed Execution of Language-instructed Item Via
Engineered Relay), a fully integrated framework for cooperative multi-robot
pickup and delivery driven by natural language commands. DELIVER unifies
natural language understanding, spatial decomposition, relay planning, and
motion execution to enable scalable, collision-free coordination in real-world
settings. Given a spoken or written instruction, a lightweight instance of
LLaMA3 interprets the command to extract pickup and delivery locations. The
environment is partitioned using a Voronoi tessellation to define
robot-specific operating regions. Robots then compute optimal relay points
along shared boundaries and coordinate handoffs. A finite-state machine governs
each robot's behavior, enabling robust execution. We implement DELIVER on the
MultiTRAIL simulation platform and validate it in both ROS2-based Gazebo
simulations and real-world hardware using TurtleBot3 robots. Empirical results
show that DELIVER maintains consistent mission cost across varying team sizes
while reducing per-agent workload by up to 55% compared to a single-agent
system. Moreover, the number of active relay agents remains low even as team
size increases, demonstrating the system's scalability and efficient agent
utilization. These findings underscore DELIVER's modular and extensible
architecture for language-guided multi-robot coordination, advancing the
frontiers of cyber-physical system integration.

Conclusion: ZeST方法通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的视觉推理能力，实现了实时生成地形可通行性地图，不仅避免了机器人暴露于危险环境的风险，还显著提升了导航系统的安全性和效率。

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the
ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for
generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting
robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and
safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging
visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a
traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach
not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated
with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of
advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled
indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our
method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art
methods, constantly reaching the final goal.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架成功地在物理机器人上进行了测试，并取得了有希望的结果，证明了其在处理不确定性和传感器噪声方面的有效性。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior in robotic assistants requires the integration of
multiple components and technological advances. Often, the problem is reduced
to recognizing explicit prompts, which limits autonomy, or is oversimplified
through assumptions such as near-perfect information. We argue that a critical
gap remains unaddressed -- specifically, the challenge of reasoning about the
uncertain outcomes and perception errors inherent to human intention
recognition. In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient to
uncertainty and sensor noise, integrating real-time sensor data with a
combination of planners. Centered around an intention-recognition POMDP, our
approach addresses cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty. Our
integrated framework has been successfully tested on a physical robot with
promising results.

Conclusion: QuadKAN通过样条参数化策略提供了一种简单、高效且可解释的方法，用于实现稳健的视觉引导四足运动控制。

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Previous simulations and Software-in-the-Loop testing have prompted further

Motivation: 当前路径规划算法（如EIT*）在启发式的准确性和计算效率之间存在矛盾，DIT*旨在通过优化搜索方向来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DIT*，一种基于采样的规划器，通过定义边为广义向量并整合相似性指数来建立方向滤波器，选择最近邻并估计方向成本，用于边评估。

Result: DIT*在测试问题中收敛速度优于现有单查询采样规划器，并在实际环境中验证了其效果。

Conclusion: DIT*（Direction Informed Trees）通过优化搜索方向和利用方向成本启发式，在R^4到R^16的测试问题中比现有单查询采样规划器收敛更快，并在实际环境中展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Optimal path planning requires finding a series of feasible states from the
starting point to the goal to optimize objectives. Popular path planning
algorithms, such as Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), employ effort heuristics to
guide the search. Effective heuristics are accurate and computationally
efficient, but achieving both can be challenging due to their conflicting
nature. This paper proposes Direction Informed Trees (DIT*), a sampling-based
planner that focuses on optimizing the search direction for each edge,
resulting in goal bias during exploration. We define edges as generalized
vectors and integrate similarity indexes to establish a directional filter that
selects the nearest neighbors and estimates direction costs. The estimated
direction cost heuristics are utilized in edge evaluation. This strategy allows
the exploration to share directional information efficiently. DIT* convergence
faster than existing single-query, sampling-based planners on tested problems
in R^4 to R^16 and has been demonstrated in real-world environments with
various planning tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is

Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors
without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical
hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints.
Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require
manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting
real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition
(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and
master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We
demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a
Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream
tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all
baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.
Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that
enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,
representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic
systems. Demonstration videos are available at

Abstract: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time
multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have
developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans
in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.
This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered
device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are
spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an
autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel
discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local
environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward
depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both
empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our
approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient
multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of
a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional
case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in
the context of autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: AutoRing提供了一个可行的框架，用于开发能够执行复杂眼内手术的智能眼科手术系统。

Abstract: Intraocular foreign body removal demands millimeter-level precision in
confined intraocular spaces, yet existing robotic systems predominantly rely on
manual teleoperation with steep learning curves. To address the challenges of
autonomous manipulation (particularly kinematic uncertainties from variable
motion scaling and variation of the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) point), we
propose AutoRing, an imitation learning framework for autonomous intraocular
foreign body ring manipulation. Our approach integrates dynamic RCM calibration
to resolve coordinate-system inconsistencies caused by intraocular instrument
variation and introduces the RCM-ACT architecture, which combines
action-chunking transformers with real-time kinematic realignment. Trained
solely on stereo visual data and instrument kinematics from expert
demonstrations in a biomimetic eye model, AutoRing successfully completes ring
grasping and positioning tasks without explicit depth sensing. Experimental
validation demonstrates end-to-end autonomy under uncalibrated microscopy
conditions. The results provide a viable framework for developing intelligent

Abstract: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving
deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently
expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically
generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which
regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task
performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex
interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task
requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region
model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning
query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage
process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before
directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,
our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task
performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path
towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally
efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作任务本质上是非马尔可夫的，需要时间上下文，但主流VLA模型通常忽略这一点，导致在长时程、时间依赖任务中表现不佳。受人类工作记忆和海马体系统的启发，提出MemoryVLA以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出MemoryVLA框架，结合预训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）编码观测数据为感知和认知令牌，形成工作记忆，并通过感知-认知记忆库存储低层细节与高层语义信息。工作记忆从库中检索相关条目并与当前令牌自适应融合，更新记忆库。最终，基于记忆条件的扩散动作专家生成时间感知的动作序列。

Result: 在仿真任务（SimperEnv-Bridge、Fractal、LIBERO-5）中，MemoryVLA分别达到71.9%、72.7%和96.5%的成功率，均优于基线CogACT和pi-0（Bridge任务提升+14.6）。在12个真实世界任务中，成功率为84.0%，长时程任务较基线提升+26。

Conclusion: MemoryVLA通过结合工作记忆和长期记忆机制，显著提升了长时程机器人操作任务的性能，在仿真和真实任务中均优于现有基线。

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

Motivation: 电磁信号的高度异质性、强背景噪声和复杂的时频结构使得现有通用模型无法直接应用，且缺乏跨任务泛化和迁移效率。

Conclusion: EMind作为一个统一的电磁信号基础模型，通过大规模预训练和独特的模态特性，显著提升了电磁信号处理的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and

### [110] [Integral Online Algorithms for Set Cover and Load Balancing with Convex Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18383)
*Thomas Kesselheim,Marco Molinaro,Kalen Patton,Sahil Singla*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种直接设计积分在线算法的方法，成功将分数设置下的结果扩展到积分设置，并进一步推广到更广泛的范数类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在线优化中的Set Cover和Load Balancing问题在凸目标下已有最优算法，但现有方法仅限于分数设置，无法直接应用于积分设置。

Method: 通过将问题简化为在线打包问题，并设计近似算法来解决这些打包问题，采用解耦全局打包问题和随机激活阈值两个关键思想。

Result: 1. 将Azar等人（2016）和Kesselheim等人（2024）的结果从分数扩展到积分设置；2. 将结果推广到在线广义调度问题；3. 扩展到范数的不相交组合。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种直接设计积分在线算法的方法，绕过了凸松弛和对偶技术，成功将分数设置下的结果扩展到积分设置，并进一步推广到更广泛的范数类别。

Abstract: Online Set Cover and Load Balancing are central problems in online
optimization, and there is a long line of work on developing algorithms for
these problems with convex objectives. Although we know optimal online
algorithms with $\ell_p$-norm objectives, recent developments for general norms
and convex objectives that rely on the online primal-dual framework apply only
to fractional settings due to large integrality gaps.
  Our work focuses on directly designing integral online algorithms for Set
Cover and Load Balancing with convex objectives, bypassing the
convex-relaxation and the primal-dual technique. Some of the main implications
are:
  1. For Online Set Cover, we can extend the results of Azar et. al. (2016) for
convex objectives and of Kesselheim, Molinaro, and Singla (2024) for symmetric
norms from fractional to integral settings.
  2. Our results for convex objectives and symmetric norms even apply to the
online generalized scheduling problem, which generalizes both Set Cover and
Load Balancing. Previous works could only handle the offline version of this
problem with norm objectives (Deng, Li, and Rabani 2023).
  3. Our methods easily extend to settings with disjoint-composition of norms.
This allows us to recover or improve the norm-composition results of Nagarajan
and Shen (2020), and Kesselheim, Molinaro, and Singla (2024), and to extend our
results to a large class of norms beyond symmetric.
  Our approach is to first reduce these problems to online packing problems,
and then to design good approximation algorithms for the latter. To solve these
packing problems, we use two key ideas. First, we decouple the global packing
problem into a series of local packing problems on different machines. Next, we
choose random activation thresholds for machines such that conditional on a
machine being activated, the expected number of jobs it covers is high compared
to its cost.

*Ahan Mishra,Parker Rho,Robert Kleinberg*

TL;DR: 本文通过新方法证明了$m=4$时pinwheel实例的密度界限为0.84，首次突破$\frac{5}{6}$。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究pinwheel实例的密度界限，特别是在最小元素$m$较大的情况下，探索密度界限与$m$的关系。

Method: 开发了新的技术，包括一个基于启发式的快速pinwheel求解器和展开操作。

Result: 对于$m=4$的实例，证明了密度界限为0.84，优于之前已知的$\frac{5}{6}$。

Conclusion: 本文证明了对于$m=4$的pinwheel实例，密度界限为0.84，这是首次证明严格优于$\frac{5}{6}$的结果。

Abstract: The density bound for schedulability for general pinwheel instances is
$\frac{5}{6}$, but density bounds better than $\frac{5}{6}$ can be shown for
cases in which the minimum element $m$ of the instance is large. Several recent
works have studied the question of the 'density gap' as a function of $m$, with
best known lower and upper bounds of $O \left( \frac{1}{m} \right)$ and $O
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \right)$. We prove a density bound of $0.84$ for $m =
4$, the first $m$ for which a bound strictly better than $\frac{5}{6} =
0.8\overline{3}$ can be proven. In doing so, we develop new techniques,
particularly a fast heuristic-based pinwheel solver and an unfolding operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 哈密顿行走问题在单智能体框架中已有广泛研究，但多智能体框架下的类似问题尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究多智能体系统中的哈密顿行走问题，并设计高效的近似算法。

Abstract: This paper considers the Hamiltonian walk problem in the multi-agent
coordination framework, referred to as $k$-agents Hamiltonian walk problem
($k$-HWP). In this problem, a set of $k$ connected agents collectively compute
a spanning walk of a given undirected graph in the minimum steps. At each step,
the agents are at $k$ distinct vertices and the induced subgraph made by the
occupied vertices remains connected. In the next consecutive steps, each agent
may remain stationary or move to one of its neighbours.To the best of our
knowledge, this problem has not been previously explored in the context of
multi-agent systems with connectivity. As a generalization of the well-known
Hamiltonian walk problem (when $k=1$), $k$-HWP is NP-hard. We propose a
$(3-\frac{1}{21})$-approximation algorithm for 2-HWP on arbitrary graphs. For
the tree, we define a restricted version of the problem and present an optimal
algorithm for arbitrary values of $k$. Finally, we formalize the problem for
$k$-uniform hypergraphs and present a $2(1+\ln k)$-approximation algorithm.
This result is also adapted to design an approximation algorithm for $k$-HWP on
general graphs when $k = O(1)$.

Method: 提出并分析了MM算法，该算法首先按大小非递增排序物品序列，然后重复将剩余序列中尽可能多的最大和最小物品打包到当前打开的单个箱子中。

Result: 证明MM算法的渐近近似比上限为1.5，分析了两类算法子类的性能界限，包括交集的下界1.25，并将分析扩展到基数约束的装箱问题。

Conclusion: 本文证明了MM算法的渐近近似比最多为1.5，并全面分析了其两类子算法的理论性能界限，包括两类算法交集的下界1.25。此外，还将理论分析扩展到基数约束的装箱问题。

Abstract: In the (1-dimensional) bin packing problem, we are asked to pack all the
given items into bins, each of capacity one, so that the number of non-empty
bins is minimized. Zhu~[Chaos, Solitons \& Fractals 2016] proposed an
approximation algorithm $MM$ that sorts the item sequence in a non-increasing
order by size at the beginning, and then repeatedly packs, into the current
single open bin, first as many of the largest items in the remaining sequence
as possible and then as many of the smallest items in the remaining sequence as
possible. In this paper we prove that the asymptotic approximation ratio of
$MM$ is at most 1.5. Next, focusing on the fact that $MM$ is at the
intersection of two algorithm classes, max-min algorithms and 1-bounded space
algorithms, we comprehensively analyze the theoretical performance bounds of
each subclass derived from the two classes. Our results include a lower bound
of 1.25 for the intersection of the two classes. Furthermore, we extend the
theoretical analysis over algorithm classes to the cardinality constrained bin
packing problem.

*Wei Xuan,Yan Liang,Huawei Cao,Ning Lin,Xiaochun Ye,Dongrui Fan*

TL;DR: Proposed DTC algorithms (DTC-AR and DTC-FD) improve triangle counting in dynamic graph streams, offering high accuracy and efficiency, with significant performance gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the impracticality of exact triangle counting in massive graph streams and the limitations of existing distributed streaming algorithms in handling edge deletions and adaptability.

Method: The paper introduces two algorithms: DTC-AR for accurate triangle counting without prior graph size knowledge, and DTC-FD for fully dynamic graph streams with edge insertions and deletions, using Random Pairing and future edge insertion compensation.

Result: Experimental results show DTC-AR achieves up to 2029.4× and 27.1× more accuracy, while DTC-FD reduces estimation errors by up to 32.5× and 19.3×, scaling linearly with graph stream size.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed DTC algorithms (DTC-AR and DTC-FD) significantly improve accuracy and efficiency in triangle counting for dynamic graph streams, demonstrating their practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Triangle counting is a fundamental problem in graph mining, essential for
analyzing graph streams with arbitrary edge orders. However, exact counting
becomes impractical due to the massive size of real-world graph streams. To
address this, approximate algorithms have been developed, but existing
distributed streaming algorithms lack adaptability and struggle with edge
deletions. In this article, we propose DTC, a novel family of single-pass
distributed streaming algorithms for global and local triangle counting in
fully dynamic graph streams. Our DTC-AR algorithm accurately estimates triangle
counts without prior knowledge of graph size, leveraging multi-machine
resources. Additionally, we introduce DTC-FD, an algorithm tailored for fully
dynamic graph streams, incorporating edge insertions and deletions. Using
Random Pairing and future edge insertion compensation, DTC-FD achieves unbiased
and accurate approximations across multiple machines. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over baselines. DTC-AR achieves up to
$2029.4\times$ and $27.1\times$ more accuracy, while maintaining the best
trade-off between accuracy and storage space. DTC-FD reduces estimation errors
by up to $32.5\times$ and $19.3\times$, scaling linearly with graph stream
size. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in
tackling triangle counting in real-world scenarios. The source code and
datasets are released and available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的代理在科学工作流中的应用日益增多，但现有的研究网络基础设施（CI）存在异构API和安全模型的障碍，阻碍了代理的使用。

Method: 通过在实际案例中应用MCP协议，包括计算化学、生物信息学、量子化学和文件系统监控等领域，展示了MCP导向架构的实用性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used to plan and
execute scientific workflows, yet most research cyberinfrastructure (CI)
exposes heterogeneous APIs and implements security models that present barriers
for use by agents. We report on our experience using the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) as a unifying interface that makes research capabilities discoverable,
invokable, and composable. Our approach is pragmatic: we implement thin MCP
servers over mature services, including Globus Transfer, Compute, and Search;
status APIs exposed by computing facilities; Octopus event fabric; and
domain-specific tools such as Garden and Galaxy. We use case studies in
computational chemistry, bioinformatics, quantum chemistry, and filesystem
monitoring to illustrate how this MCP-oriented architecture can be used in
practice. We distill lessons learned and outline open challenges in evaluation
and trust for agent-led science.

TL;DR: 本文针对现代GPU的复杂分区约束，提出了动态分区和调度方案，显著提升了科学和ML工作负载的吞吐量和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU（如Ampere和Hopper系列）虽然具备高性能和安全性隔离特性，但其复杂的芯片分区约束使得充分利用并发性具有挑战性。

Method: 开发了动态内存估计、分区融合和分区裂变等几种方案，并支持进程重启以优化内存错误恢复。

Result: 在A100 GPU上，通用工作负载的吞吐量和能效分别提升了6.20倍和5.93倍，ML工作负载分别提升了1.59倍和1.12倍。LLM工作负载的吞吐量和能效也有显著提升。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的分区和调度方案显著提升了GPU的吞吐量和能效，特别是在科学和ML工作负载中表现优异。

Abstract: Modern GPUs such as the Ampere series (A30, A100) as well as the Hopper
series (H100, H200) offer performance as well as security isolation features.
They also support a good amount of concurrency, but taking advantage of it can
be quite challenging due to the complex constraints on partitioning the chip.
  In this work, we develop partitioning and scheduling schemes for a variety of
workloads, ranging from scientific to modern ML workloads, including LLMs. We
develop several schemes involving dynamic memory estimation, partition fusion
and partition fission. We also support process restart to recover from
out-of-memory errors for workloads and early restart as an optimization. This
approach yields up to 6.20x throughput and 5.93x energy improvements for
general workloads; and we see 1.59x and 1.12x improvement to throughput and
energy, respectively, for ML workloads on an A100 GPU. We leverage this
technique on LLM workloads and show good improvements, including up to 1.43x
throughput improvement and 1.11x energy savings.

TL;DR: Strata是一个高效的长上下文LLM服务框架，通过优化缓存和调度，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLM服务中，缓存KV状态对避免冗余计算至关重要，但现有系统在GPU内存容量和I/O性能上存在瓶颈。

Method: Strata采用GPU辅助I/O解决KV缓存碎片化问题，解耦GPU和CPU内存布局，并利用缓存感知请求调度平衡计算与I/O延迟。

Result: 在SGLang上部署的Strata框架，相比vLLM + LMCache和NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM，在长上下文基准测试中分别实现了5倍和3.75倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: Strata框架通过GPU辅助I/O和缓存感知调度，显著提升了长上下文LLM服务的性能，同时保持短上下文性能不下降。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with expanding context windows face significant
performance hurdles. While caching key-value (KV) states is critical for
avoiding redundant computation, the storage footprint of long-context caches
quickly exceeds GPU memory capacity, forcing production systems to adopt
hierarchical caching across memory hierarchies. However, transferring large
cached contexts back to the GPU introduces severe performance bottlenecks:
fragmented I/O from paged layouts prevents full bandwidth utilization, and
existing schedulers fail to account for cache-loading delays, leaving systems
loading-bound rather than compute-bound. We present Strata, a hierarchical
context caching framework designed for efficient long context LLM serving.
Strata introduces GPU-assisted I/O to combat KV cache fragmentation, decoupling
GPU and CPU memory layouts and employs cache-aware request scheduling to
balance compute with I/O latency and overlapping unavoidable stalls with
complementary tasks. Built on SGLang and deployed in production, Strata
achieves up to 5x lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) compared to vLLM + LMCache
and 3.75x speedup over NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM on long-context benchmarks, without
degrading short-context performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPC架构复杂化和不规则科学算法的普及，亟需高效支持异步多线程通信，尤其是AMT系统。

Method: 通过MPI级微基准测试和HPX运行时集成，评估VCI和Continuation扩展的性能。

Result: 扩展相比标准MPI能提升性能，但多VCI设置下的最大多线程消息率受限，单VCI-per-thread模式在实际系统中效果不佳。

Conclusion: 当前的MPI扩展（如VCI和Continuation）虽能提升性能，但在多VCI设置下仍存在限制，需改进以提高多线程通信的可扩展性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of HPC architectures and the growing adoption of
irregular scientific algorithms demand efficient support for asynchronous,
multithreaded communication. This need is especially pronounced with
Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems. This communication pattern was not a
consideration during the design of the original MPI specification. The MPI
community has recently introduced several extensions to address these evolving
requirements. This work evaluates two such extensions, the Virtual
Communication Interface (VCI) and the Continuation extensions, in the context
of an established AMT runtime HPX. We begin by using an MPI-level
microbenchmark, modeled from HPX's low-level communication mechanism, to
measure the peak performance potential of these extensions. We then integrate
them into HPX to evaluate their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our
results show that while these extensions can enhance performance compared to
standard MPI, areas for improvement remain. The current continuation proposal
limits the maximum multithreaded message rate achievable in the multi-VCI
setting. Furthermore, the recommended one-VCI-per-thread mode proves
ineffective in real-world systems due to the attentiveness problem. These
findings underscore the importance of improving intra-VCI threading efficiency
to achieve scalable multithreaded communication and fully realize the benefits
of recent MPI extensions.

TL;DR: ClusterFusion通过片上通信原语和融合执行框架，显著提升LLM解码效率，平均延迟降低1.61倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM解码的高延迟问题源于分散的算子执行和频繁的片外内存访问，现有硬件缺乏高效的片上通信抽象。

Method: 设计ClusterFusion执行框架，结合ClusterReduce和ClusterGather通信原语，将解码阶段（如QKV投影、注意力、输出投影）融合为单个内核。

Result: 在H100 GPU上，ClusterFusion的平均端到端延迟比现有推理框架低1.61倍。

Conclusion: ClusterFusion通过引入ClusterReduce和ClusterGather通信原语，显著降低了LLM解码的延迟，证明了其在现代GPU架构上的高效性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to
fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for
data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for
fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While
modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory
and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data
movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip
communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two
cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which
abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data
exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing
intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building
on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that
schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope
by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output
Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that
ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on
average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations. The

Motivation: 传统基于作业或文件名的识别方法在用户自定义命名（如a.out）时不可靠，需一种能克服版本或编译差异、同时保护隐私和文件完整性的新方法。

Method: 采用模糊哈希技术对可执行文件进行相似性检测，结合进程元数据、环境信息和可执行文件哈希，构建了SIREN框架。

Result: 在LUMI上的初步部署显示，SIREN能有效识别软件使用情况、重复执行的应用，并通过相似性识别未知应用。

Conclusion: SIREN 框架通过模糊哈希和进程级数据收集，成功提升了HPC系统中软件识别的准确性和隐私保护，为系统优化和安全改进提供了有效工具。

Abstract: HPC systems use monitoring and operational data analytics to ensure
efficiency, performance, and orderly operations. Application-specific insights
are crucial for analyzing the increasing complexity and diversity of HPC
workloads, particularly through the identification of unknown software and
recognition of repeated executions, which facilitate system optimization and
security improvements. However, traditional identification methods using job or
file names are unreliable for arbitrary user-provided names (a.out). Fuzzy
hashing of executables detects similarities despite changes in executable
version or compilation approach while preserving privacy and file integrity,
overcoming these limitations. We introduce SIREN, a process-level data
collection framework for software identification and recognition. SIREN
improves observability in HPC by enabling analysis of process metadata,
environment information, and executable fuzzy hashes. Findings from a first
opt-in deployment campaign on LUMI show SIREN's ability to provide insights
into software usage, recognition of repeated executions of known applications,
and similarity-based identification of unknown applications.

Abstract: For decades, supercritical flame simulations incorporating detailed chemistry

the resolved spatial and temporal scales of the physical system. We optimize
the supercritical flame simulation software DeepFlame -- which incorporates
deep neural networks while retaining the real-fluid mechanical and chemical
accuracy -- from three perspectives: parallel computing, computational
efficiency, and I/O performance. Our highly optimized DeepFlame achieves
supercritical liquid oxygen/methane (LOX/\ce{CH4}) turbulent combustion
simulation of up to 618 and 154 billion cells with unprecedented
time-to-solution, attaining 439/1186 and 187/316 PFlop/s (32.3\%/21.8\% and
37.4\%/31.8\% of the peak) in FP32/mixed-FP16 precision on Sunway (98,304

Motivation: 解决GPU在深度学习训练中的低利用率问题，同时避免任务崩溃和资源干扰。

Method: CARMA结合了GPUMemNet（基于ML的GPU内存估计框架）和资源分配策略，以减少内存错误和资源干扰。

Result: CARMA使GPU利用率提升39.3%，执行时间减少约26.7%，能耗降低约14.2%。

Conclusion: CARMA通过提高GPU利用率、减少执行时间和降低能耗，显著提升了深度学习训练任务的效率。

Abstract: Studies conducted on enterprise-scale infrastructure have shown that GPUs --
the core computational resource for deep learning (DL) training -- are often
significantly underutilized. DL task collocation on GPUs is an opportunity to
address this challenge. However, it may result in (1) out-of-memory crashes for
the subsequently arriving task and (2) slowdowns for all tasks sharing the GPU
due to resource interference. The former challenge poses a threat to
robustness, while the latter affects the quality of service and energy
efficiency.
  We propose CARMA, a server-scale task-level collocation-aware resource
management system that handles both collocation challenges. CARMA encompasses
GPUMemNet, a novel ML-based GPU memory estimator framework for DL training
tasks, to minimize out-of-memory errors and introduces collocation policies
that cap GPU utilization to minimize interference. Furthermore, CARMA
introduces a recovery method to ensure robust restart of tasks that crash. Our
evaluation on traces modeled after real-world DL training task traces shows

TL;DR: FLUX系统通过创新技术优化MoE-based LLMs的联邦微调，显著提升效率，适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于MoE-based LLMs的高计算需求和参与者资源限制，现有方法无法满足性能要求。FLUX旨在解决这一问题，使资源受限的参与者（如消费级GPU）能够高效进行联邦微调。

Method: FLUX系统引入了三种关键技术：量化本地分析以估计专家激活、自适应层感知专家合并以减少资源消耗、动态专家角色分配以平衡调优和非调优专家。

Result: 在LLaMA-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE上的实验表明，FLUX显著优于现有方法，实现了高达4.75倍的加速。

Conclusion: FLUX系统通过创新的量化本地分析、自适应层感知专家合并和动态专家角色分配，显著提高了联邦微调MoE-based LLMs的效率，实现了高达4.75倍的加速。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models
(LLMs) is challenging due to their massive computational requirements and the
resource constraints of participants. Existing working attempts to fill this
gap through model quantization, computation offloading, or expert pruning.
However, they cannot achieve desired performance due to impractical system
assumptions and a lack of consideration for MoE-specific characteristics. In
this paper, we propose FLUX, a system designed to enable federated fine-tuning
of MoE-based LLMs across participants with constrained computing resources
(e.g., consumer-grade GPUs), aiming to minimize time-to-accuracy. FLUX
introduces three key innovations: (1) quantization-based local profiling to
estimate expert activation with minimal overhead, (2) adaptive layer-aware
expert merging to reduce resource consumption while preserving accuracy, and
(3) dynamic expert role assignment using an exploration-exploitation strategy
to balance tuning and non-tuning experts. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-MoE
and DeepSeek-MoE with multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLUX
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 4.75X speedup in
time-to-accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纳米级电子器件设计中，强电子-电子相互作用需要更精确的建模工具。

Method: 结合非平衡格林函数（NEGF）和密度泛函理论（DFT），并扩展GW近似，采用新型空间域分解方案。

Result: QuaTrEx能够处理多达84,480原子的器件，在超算上表现出色（>80%弱扩展效率，1.15 Eflop/s）。

Conclusion: QuaTrEx实现了首个能够处理实验规模NRFET几何的NEGF+GW方案，展示了在超算上的高性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Designing nanoscale electronic devices such as the currently manufactured
nanoribbon field-effect transistors (NRFETs) requires advanced modeling tools
capturing all relevant quantum mechanical effects. State-of-the-art approaches
combine the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism and density
functional theory (DFT). However, as device dimensions do not exceed a few
nanometers anymore, electrons are confined in ultra-small volumes, giving rise
to strong electron-electron interactions. To account for these critical
effects, DFT+NEGF solvers should be extended with the GW approximation, which
massively increases their computational intensity. Here, we present the first
implementation of the NEGF+GW scheme capable of handling NRFET geometries with
dimensions comparable to experiments. This package, called QuaTrEx, makes use
of a novel spatial domain decomposition scheme, can treat devices made of up to
84,480 atoms, scales very well on the Alps and Frontier supercomputers (>80%
weak scaling efficiency), and sustains an exascale FP64 performance on 42,240
atoms (1.15 Eflop/s).

TL;DR: CTF-Dojo是一个为LLM训练设计的大规模可执行环境，通过自动化工具和验证反馈显著提升代理性能，无需昂贵专有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可扩展和可泛化的执行基础环境稀缺，限制了训练更强大ML代理的进展。

Method: 引入了CTF-Dojo，一个大规模可执行运行环境，包含658个功能完整的CTF挑战，并开发了CTF-Forge自动化管道，快速生成执行环境。

Result: 仅使用486条高质量执行验证轨迹训练的LLM代理，在三个基准测试中表现优于基线，最高提升11.6%，32B模型达到31.9% Pass@1，创下开放权重新纪录。

Conclusion: CTF-Dojo通过提供可执行运行环境和可验证反馈，证明了执行基础训练信号在提升高性能ML代理中的关键作用，无需依赖昂贵专有系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a
benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that
execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in
advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的编程助手在代码理解上的对齐问题，以指导LLM在软件工程工作流中的集成和改进。

Method: 通过比较LLM的困惑度（perplexity）和人类程序员的神经生理反应（EEG-based fixation-related potentials）来操作化理解过程。

Result: LLM困惑度的峰值在位置和幅度上与人类表示困惑的神经生理反应相关。

Conclusion: LLMs和人类程序员在代码理解上的困惑相似，这一发现为改进LLM在软件开发工作流中的集成提供了依据。

Abstract: Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language
models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks. Clearly, a
misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to
misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs.
  A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the
same kind of code. This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in
software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of
LLMs.
  To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human
programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. We operationalized
comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers
using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related
potentials).
  We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and
amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion. This
result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code.
Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to
identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human
programmers.

*Yan Wang,Xinyi Hou,Yanjie Zhao,Weiguo Lin,Haoyu Wang,Junjun Si*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LaQual是一个自动化框架，通过分层分类、静态指标筛选和动态场景评估，有效提升LLM应用商店中高质量应用的发现和推荐效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM应用商店的排名和推荐方法主要依赖静态指标，如用户活跃度和收藏数，导致用户难以高效找到高质量应用。

Method: LaQual框架包括三个阶段：1) 分层标记和分类LLM应用；2) 使用静态指标（如时间加权用户参与度和功能能力指标）筛选低质量应用；3) 进行动态、场景自适应的评估，由LLM生成场景特定的评估指标、评分规则和任务。

Result: 实验证明LaQual有效，其自动化评分与人类判断高度一致（Spearman's rho为0.62和0.60），并能将候选LLM应用减少66.7%至81.3%。用户研究表明，LaQual在决策信心、比较效率和评估报告感知价值方面显著优于基线系统。

Conclusion: LaQual提供了一个可扩展、客观且以用户为中心的解决方案，用于在实际使用案例中发现和推荐高质量的LLM应用。

Abstract: LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of
intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content
creation, coding support, education, and more. However, the current methods for
ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics
like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently
find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an
automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of
three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical
way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static
indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability
metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,
scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific
evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.
Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its
automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's
rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in
travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of
candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual
significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison
efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived
value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results
demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered
solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仅依赖大型语言模型（LLMs）的代码生成方法在生成代码质量上存在不足，无法保证满足实际需求，缺乏对需求开发和建模的系统策略。

Method: ReDeFo框架包含三个智能体，强调了形式化方法的知识和技术的增强，以加强需求到代码生成过程中的质量保证。

Result: ReDeFo框架通过形式化规范实现了对正确性的严格推理、隐藏错误的发现以及关键属性的强制执行。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于需求开发和形式化的多智能体框架ReDeFo，旨在通过形式化规范填补自然语言需求与可执行代码之间的鸿沟，从而实现可靠、自动生成的软件。

Abstract: Automated code generation has long been considered the holy grail of software
engineering. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a
revolutionary breakthrough in this area. However, existing methods that only
rely on LLMs remain inadequate in the quality of generated code, offering no
guarantees of satisfying practical requirements. They lack a systematic
strategy for requirements development and modeling. Recently, LLM-based agents
typically possess powerful abilities and play an essential role in facilitating
the alignment of LLM outputs with user requirements. In this paper, we envision
the first multi-agent framework for reliable code generation based on
\textsc{re}quirements \textsc{de}velopment and \textsc{fo}rmalization, named
\textsc{ReDeFo}. This framework incorporates three agents, highlighting their
augmentation with knowledge and techniques of formal methods, into the
requirements-to-code generation pipeline to strengthen quality assurance. The
core of \textsc{ReDeFo} is the use of formal specifications to bridge the gap
between potentially ambiguous natural language requirements and precise
executable code. \textsc{ReDeFo} enables rigorous reasoning about correctness,
uncovering hidden bugs, and enforcing critical properties throughout the
development process. In general, our framework aims to take a promising step
toward realizing the long-standing vision of reliable, auto-generated software.

TL;DR: RecovSlicing 通过部分仪器化和LLMs推断，在单次运行中高效计算动态数据依赖，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在动态数据依赖分析中的高成本和不可行性问题，特别是在处理库定义和非确定性程序时。

Method: 利用LLMs从部分记录的跟踪和代码上下文中推断程序行为，恢复缺失的执行以估计运行时定义。

Result: 在三个切片基准测试中，RecovSlicing 的准确率和召回率显著优于基线方法，并在回归错误定位中提高了16%的发现率。

Conclusion: RecovSlicing 是一种高效的方法，用于在单次运行中计算动态数据依赖关系，通过部分仪器化和LLMs的推断能力，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Dynamic data dependency, answering "why a variable has this value?", is
critical for debugging. Given a program step `s` reading a variable `v`,
finding the dynamic definition of `v` is challenging. Traditional methods
require either (1) exhaustive instrumentation of all possible definitions of
`v` in one run or (2) replicating the run to re-examine reads/writes - both
costly. If `v` is defined in a library, instrumentation becomes expensive; for
non-deterministic programs, replication is infeasible.
  We propose RecovSlicing, which computes dynamic data dependency in a single
run with partial instrumentation. We leverage LLMs to infer program behavior
from a partially recorded trace and code context. Given a trace and a slicing
criterion (step `s` and variable `v`), RecovSlicing estimates the runtime
definition of `v` by recovering the missing execution.It also supports implicit
variables, such as those in `list.get(i)`. Technically, RecovSlicing tackles:
(1) recovering runtime values and structures, and (2) aligning recovered
variables with recorded memory to analyze definitions.
  We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8,300 data dependencies across three slicing
benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution
Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves accuracy of 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3%,
outperforming the best baseline (39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%), and also leads in recall
(91.1%, 91.1%, 98.3% vs. 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a regression bug
localizer, it enables finding 16% more regressions.

Motivation: 尽管AI-based code review工具日益普及，但其实际影响知之甚少。

Method: 开发了一个两阶段LLM辅助框架来确定评论是否被处理，并使用可解释的机器学习识别影响因素。

Result: 分析显示，工具的采用率在增长，但效果差异显著。简洁、包含代码片段且手动触发的评论更可能引发代码变更。

Conclusion: AI-based code review tools的采用率在增长，但效果差异显著。简洁、包含代码片段且手动触发的评论（尤其是来自hunk-level工具的评论）更可能引发代码变更。这些结果强调了工具设计的重要性，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: AI-based code review tools automatically review and comment on pull requests
to improve code quality. Despite their growing presence, little is known about
their actual impact. We present a large-scale empirical study of 16 popular
AI-based code review actions for GitHub workflows, analyzing more than 22,000
review comments in 178 repositories. We investigate (1) how these tools are
adopted and configured, (2) whether their comments lead to code changes, and
(3) which factors influence their effectiveness. We develop a two-stage
LLM-assisted framework to determine whether review comments are addressed, and
use interpretable machine learning to identify influencing factors. Our
findings show that, while adoption is growing, effectiveness varies widely.
Comments that are concise, contain code snippets, and are manually triggered,
particularly those from hunk-level review tools, are more likely to result in
code changes. These results highlight the importance of careful tool design and
suggest directions for improving AI-based code review systems.

TL;DR: 该研究调查了GitHub项目如何使用和定制SonarQube Cloud。研究发现，多数项目依赖默认配置，但近半数会定制质量门条件。未来研究方向是将配置与实际软件成果关联，以提供更优的SCA工具配置建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态代码分析（SCA）工具被广泛用于强制执行代码质量标准，但关于开源项目如何使用和定制这些工具的了解甚少。

Method: 我们对通过GitHub Actions与SonarQube Cloud项目关联的GitHub项目进行了挖掘研究。

Result: 在321个使用SonarQube Cloud的GitHub项目中，81%正确连接到SonarQube Cloud项目，其余存在配置错误或访问受限。在265个可访问的SonarQube Cloud项目中，75%使用组织的默认质量门（即一组部署源代码必须满足的条件以通过自动化检查）。55%的项目使用SonarQube Cloud内置的质量门，45%的项目定制了质量门条件。最常见的质量条件与SonarQube Cloud的“Clean as You Code”原则一致，并强制执行安全性、可维护性、可靠性、覆盖率和少量重复代码检查。

Conclusion: 许多项目依赖预定义配置，但仍有显著比例的项目通过定制化配置来满足特定的质量目标。基于初步结果，我们展望未来的研究方向，将质量门配置与实际软件成果（如软件安全性的提升）联系起来，从而为在不同上下文中配置SCA工具（如SonarQube Cloud）提供基于证据的建议。

Abstract: Background: Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools are widely adopted to enforce
code quality standards. However, little is known about how open-source projects
use and customize these tools. Aims: This paper investigates how GitHub
projects use and customize a popular SCA tool, namely SonarQube Cloud. Method:
We conducted a mining study of GitHub projects that are linked through GitHub
Actions to SonarQube Cloud projects. Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using
SonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud
projects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among
265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default
quality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to
pass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate
provided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with
different conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with
SonarQube Cloud's "Clean as You Code" principle and enforce security,
maintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or
modified source code. Conclusions: Many projects rely on predefined
configurations, yet a significant portion customize their configurations to
meet specific quality goals. Building on our initial results, we envision a
future research agenda linking quality gate configurations to actual software
outcomes (e.g., improvement of software security). This would enable
evidence-based recommendations for configuring SCA tools like SonarQube Cloud
in various contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于AI模型的编译器测试方法存在生成程序过于简单和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的编译器测试框架，将测试过程分为离线阶段和在线阶段。离线阶段使用LLM生成小但功能丰富的代码片段；在线阶段通过策略性组合这些片段构建高质量测试程序。

Result: 在GCC和LLVM中发现了66个bug，其中近半数是现有基于LLM工具无法发现的严重错误。

Conclusion: LegoFuzz的高效设计为AI模型在软件测试中的应用开辟了新可能性，不仅限于C编译器。

Abstract: Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs),
has shown great promise. However, current approaches struggle with two key
problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple,
and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive. In this
paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing
process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase. In the
offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich
code pieces. In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically
combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then
used to test compilers.
  We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers. The
results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C
compilers. Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious
and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. We
believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in
software testing beyond just C compilers.

TL;DR: GitTaskBench是一个评估代码代理在真实工作流程中表现的基准测试，结果显示当前系统在复杂任务解决上仍有挑战，尤其是环境设置等关键步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试很少评估代码代理在真实工作流程驱动的场景中的表现，而利用大规模代码仓库（如GitHub）进行实际任务是现实软件开发中的关键。

Method: 引入了GitTaskBench基准测试，通过54个现实任务、7种模态和7个领域来系统评估代码代理的能力。每个任务配有一个相关仓库和自动化的人为评估工具，指定实际成功标准。

Result: 实验显示，即使最佳性能系统（OpenHands+Claude 3.7）也仅解决了48.15%的任务。超过一半的失败归因于环境设置和依赖解决等看似简单但关键的步骤。

Conclusion: GitTaskBench的发布旨在推动对代码仓库感知的任务解决能力的关注和进步，使代码代理更接近解决复杂的端到端现实世界任务。

Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g.,
GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet
current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic,
workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a
benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic
tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository
with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical
success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose
the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance,
which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer
salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with
multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task
solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude
3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of
failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and
dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow
management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we
aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning,
execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex,
end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at
https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.

Abstract: Test case prioritization focuses on finding a suitable order of execution of
the test cases in a test suite to meet some performance goals like detecting
faults early. It is likely that some test cases execute the program parts that
are more prone to errors and will detect more errors if executed early during
the testing process. Finding an optimal order of execution for the selected
regression test cases saves time and cost of retesting. This paper presents a
static approach to prioritizing the test cases by computing the affected
component coupling (ACC) of the affected parts of object-oriented programs. We
construct a graph named affected slice graph (ASG) to represent these affected
program parts.We determine the fault-proneness of the nodes of ASG by computing
their respective ACC values. We assign higher priority to those test cases that
cover the nodes with higher ACC values. Our analysis with mutation faults shows
that the test cases executing the fault-prone program parts have a higher
chance to reveal faults earlier than other test cases in the test suite. The
result obtained from seven case studies justifies that our approach is feasible
and gives acceptable performance in comparison to some existing techniques.

### [138] [Federative ischemic stroke segmentation as alternative to overcome domain-shift multi-institution challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18296)
*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种协作框架，通过联邦学习方法共享知识，显著提高了缺血性卒中病灶分割的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中病灶分析因患者人口统计、扫描设备和专家标注的差异而高度可变，且现有计算方法缺乏泛化能力。临床中心通常缺乏足够的标记样本。

Method: 采用联邦平均（FedAvg）模型，从14个模拟医疗中心的2031项研究中共享知识，以分割缺血性卒中病灶。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心上实现了平均DSC为0.71±0.24，AVD为5.29±22.74，ALD为2.16±3.60和LF1为0.70±0.26，优于集中式和其他联邦规则。模型在分布外中心也表现可靠（DSC为0.64±0.29，AVD为4.44±8.74）。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的协作框架通过共享深度中心无关表示的知识，在DWI序列中分割缺血性卒中病灶方面表现出色，优于集中式和其他联邦学习方法，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Conclusion: 简单两阶段方法在考虑数据一致性的情况下，能获得最佳分割分数，优于专门为此任务开发的复杂方法。

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

*Yan Chen,Yi Wen,Wei Li,Junchao Liu,Yong Guo,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在RAW域中恢复图像的扩散模型，通过RAW域VAE和可微后色调处理模块，实现了比sRGB域方法更高的保真度和更少的伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的sRGB域扩散模型在处理有损sRGB输入时，无法充分利用传感器RAW图像的可用性，导致在边缘设备等场景中性能不佳。RDDM旨在通过直接在RAW域处理图像，绕过这一限制。

Method: 提出了RAW域VAE（RVAE）学习最优潜在表示，以及可微的后色调处理（PTP）模块，实现RAW和sRGB空间的联合优化。此外，开发了可扩展的退化管道从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW LQ-HQ对，并设计了可配置的多拜耳（CMB）LoRA模块处理多样化的RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验表明，RDDM在保真度和伪影减少方面优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域中恢复图像，克服了传统sRGB域扩散模型的局限性，实现了更高保真度的图像恢复，且减少了伪影。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

TL;DR: 本文通过本体论和数学方法重新定义了LLM的自我意识，提出了最小条件并证明了隐藏状态流形的独特性，为安全的元认知系统奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM的意识，而本文则提出了一种本体论和数学的视角，揭示了现有方法将代理简化为无意识的策略遵从无人机，阻碍了真正的C1全局工作空间功能和C2元认知。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，证明了隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料库不同，从而支持了用户特定吸引子和自我策略的稳定性。

Result: 提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件，并证明了隐藏状态流形的独特性，从而支持了用户特定吸引子和自我策略的稳定性。

Conclusion: 论文总结认为，一个具有C1自我意识的工作空间是构建安全、元认知C2系统的必要前提，并将人类视为最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中强化学习策略处理复杂MDP的困难，以及贪婪策略无法考虑特征联合信息性或需要了解基础数据分布的问题。

Method: 提出基于模板的主动特征获取（TAFA）框架，通过学习少量特征模板库来指导特征获取。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，TAFA在性能和计算成本上均优于现有基准。

Conclusion: TAFA框架通过识别特征模板，显著减少了策略考虑的动作空间，同时避免了对基础数据分布的估计需求，在性能和成本上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

Conclusion: 研究发现在多智能体环境中，告知LLMs它们正在与自己互动会显著改变其合作倾向，这为理解智能体间无意识的歧视行为对合作的影响提供了新视角。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种利用语言模型（LMs）生成Python程序作为广义策略来解决PDDL问题的方法，且无需依赖外部验证器。实验证明，该方法在固定时间和内存限制下能解决更多PDDL问题，且LMPlan规划器能处理包含数百个相关对象的规划问题。此外，研究发现LMs在无意义符号上的规划效果优于自然语言，这对LMs的推理机制提出了新挑战。

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

Motivation: WLF在符号规划中学习价值函数方面表现出色，但现有研究未深入探讨其超参数的影响及权衡。

Method: 利用WLF的效率，在单核CPU上运行规划实验，样本量为1,000,000，以研究超参数对训练和规划的影响。

Result: 实验分析表明，WLF存在一组稳健的最佳超参数，且这些参数更注重减少执行时间。

Conclusion: WLF的最佳超参数在测试的规划领域中表现稳健，且这些参数更侧重于最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力。此外，训练与规划指标之间无显著统计相关性。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，基于WLFs的新颖性启发式在国际规划竞赛和Hard To Ground基准测试中表现良好，具有潜力。

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

Method: 论文提出了一种通用的、无需训练的框架，通过复合势场（Composite Potential Fields）整合全局知识和局部信息，包括信息、信心和连通性三个可解释的地图，形成单一核过滤决策准则。该方法采用参数化、设计师驱动的方式，仅需少量衰减和权重参数即可适应不同地图抽象。

Result: 在五个代表性游戏地图、两种玩家控制策略和五种守卫模式下，该方法在捕获效率和巡逻自然性上均优于经典基线方法。此外，常见的潜行机制（如干扰和环境元素）能作为子模块自然集成到框架中。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于复合势场的框架在提升守卫巡逻行为的自然性和效率方面表现出色，并能无缝集成常见的潜行游戏机制，为游戏设计提供了快速原型开发的灵活性。

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

Conclusion: 本研究通过提出一个可扩展的、以数据库为中心的框架，为自动化生成具有可配置游戏进程的复杂3D关卡提供了基础，推动了程序化内容生成（PCG）的发展。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

TL;DR: SchemaCoder是一种全自动日志模式提取框架，通过Residual Q-Tree Boosting机制，无需人工定制即可高效提取多种日志格式的模式，性能提升21.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的日志模式提取方法依赖预定义正则表达式，需要人工领域知识，限制了生产效率的提升。SchemaCoder旨在解决这一局限性，实现全自动化且适用于多种日志格式的模式提取。

Method: SchemaCoder采用上下文边界分割、基于嵌入的采样和分层Q-Tree驱动的LLM查询，结合文本残差进化优化器和残差提升，迭代优化模式提取。

Result: 在LogHub-2.0基准测试中，SchemaCoder平均比现有最优方法提高了21.3%的性能。

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是一种全自动的日志模式提取框架，通过其新颖的Residual Q-Tree Boosting机制，显著提升了日志模式提取的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

TL;DR: RLMR通过动态混合奖励系统平衡创意写作的主观质量与客观约束，显著提升指令遵循和写作质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以平衡创意写作中的主观写作质量与客观约束遵循，单一奖励策略无法同时提升两者，而固定权重混合奖励方法无法适应不同写作场景。

Method: 提出了RLMR（Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards），利用动态混合奖励系统，结合写作奖励模型评估主观写作质量和约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。约束遵循奖励权重根据采样组内的写作质量动态调整。

Result: 在自动化与人工评估中，RLMR在指令遵循（IFEval从83.36%提升至86.65%）和写作质量（WriteEval上72.75%的胜率）上均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: RLMR通过动态混合奖励系统，首次在在线强化学习中结合主观偏好与客观验证，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

Method: 引入了MUA-RL（多轮用户交互代理强化学习）框架，首次在代理工具使用领域将LLM模拟用户整合到强化学习循环中。

Result: MUA-RL-32B在多个基准测试中表现优异，如TAU2 Retail（67.3）、TAU2 Airline（45.4）等，超越了部分更大的开源模型。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架通过整合LLM模拟用户到强化学习循环中，显著提升了代理在多轮交互中的工具调用能力，并在多个基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越了部分更大的开源模型。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）和Agentic AI虽带来生成式应用的革新，但继承了内外部信息源的偏见，影响信息公平性和用户信任。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，通过专门设计的智能体优化信息来源选择，确保检索内容既高度相关又偏见最小。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比基线朴素检索策略，偏见减少了81.82%。

Conclusion: 引入的Bias Mitigation Agent能有效减少偏见，提升信息检索的公平性和平衡性，从而增强用户信任。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法通过限制推理连接词，实现了在高效率和准确性之间的平衡，适用于需要快速直觉和复杂推理的任务。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)

performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a

Motivation: 当前提示优化方法缺乏历史优化经验的保存和利用机制，且易过拟合，导致泛化能力差。

Method: REMO框架包含一个记忆增强的反射RAG模块（称为“错误笔记本”）和一个LLM驱动的元控制器（自适应性优化器），用于迭代改进提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，REMO相比TextGrad基线表现出更稳定和鲁棒的泛化能力。

Conclusion: REMO框架通过整合记忆增强的反射RAG模块和自适应性优化器，显著提升了提示优化的稳定性和泛化能力，尽管增加了计算开销。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

Motivation: 现实世界中的测试数据常存在领域偏移和开放集数据，传统封闭集测试时间适应方法在此类场景下表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出了Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF)和Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP)两种方法，PAF通过辅助过滤器验证主过滤器的数据，KIP整合适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识。

Conclusion: 通过提出PAF和KIP方法，本研究有效解决了开放集测试时间适应中的过滤和知识整合问题，显著提升了封闭集准确性和开放集判别能力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入基于分布距离的动态选择策略（DDS）和最小完整语义单元（MCSU）概念，显著提升了语言模型在推理任务中的表现，并在多个基准测试中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language
models through token-level multi-model collaboration. Our approach selects the
optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to
perform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models
yield better results, we introduce a distribution distance-based dynamic
selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To
address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model
collaboration, we propose the concept of minimal complete semantic units
(MCSU), which is simple yet enables multiple language models to achieve natural
alignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code will be

Conclusion: CausalMACE框架通过引入因果性规划和全局任务图，显著提升了多代理系统在Minecraft复杂任务中的效率和容错能力，取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

TL;DR: STARec是一种慢思考增强的推荐代理框架，通过两阶段训练提升推理能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统因静态用户建模和反应式决策范式存在根本性局限，STARec旨在通过自主深思熟虑的推理能力解决这些问题。

Method: STARec采用锚定强化训练的两阶段范式，结合结构化知识蒸馏和偏好对齐的奖励塑造，以培养代理的内在慢思考能力。

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs基准测试中，STARec仅使用0.4%的训练数据便实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: STARec框架通过引入慢思考增强的代理机制，显著提升了推荐系统的性能，尤其在稀疏数据场景下表现出色。

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险领域（如法律）中的局限性，并探索如何提升AI系统在司法决策中的可靠性。

Method: 使用IRAC（Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion）模型作为分析框架，研究聚焦于法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用的规则（R）及将该规则应用于案件事实（A）。

Result: 研究发现，尽管现有AI增强技术（如RAG、多智能体系统和神经符号AI）可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量和透明、可论证推理的任务中仍存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: 当前AI在法律领域最有效的角色是双重的：作为简单、重复案件的高效助手，以及作为复杂案件中人类专家的高级“陪练伙伴”。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

Motivation: 标准单轮静态基准测试无法充分评估大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂任务（如软件工程）上的细微能力。

Method: 研究者提出了一种新颖的交互式评估框架，通过结构化、反馈驱动的对话来评估LLM在多需求编程任务上的表现。每个任务被建模为需求依赖图，一个了解真实解决方案的“面试官”LLM向“面试者”模型提供最小化、有针对性的提示，以帮助纠正错误并满足目标约束。

Result: 研究基于DevAI基准（包含55个精选编程任务），通过专家标注评估了面试官提示的相关性和实用性。动态协议揭示了模型行为的细粒度诊断见解，发现了静态基准无法衡量的优势和系统性弱点。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了动态评估在推动协作代码生成代理发展中的重要性。

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

Motivation: 自动形式化是形式化验证中的核心任务，但数据稀缺和缺乏高效方法阻碍了其发展。

Method: FormaRL结合了Lean编译器的语法检查和大语言模型的一致性检查来计算奖励，并采用GRPO算法更新形式化器。

Result: 实验表明，FormaRL在ProofNet和uproof数据集上分别将pass@1准确率提升了4～6倍（4.04%→26.15%和2.4%→9.6%），并在uproof上实现了优于现有开源方法的分布外性能。

Conclusion: FormaRL通过强化学习框架显著提升了自动形式化的准确性，尤其是在数据稀缺的情况下表现优异，且开源了训练代码以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

Motivation: 智能辅导系统（ITSs）在教育中的广泛应用可能无意中加剧学生间的表现差距，因此需要学生画像来跟踪进展、识别困难学生并减少差距。

Method: 本研究提出了 CTGraph，一种图级表示学习方法，用于自监督地分析学习者的行为和表现。

Result: 实验表明，CTGraph 能够全面展示学生的学习历程，识别困难学生，并提供不同群体的比较分析，帮助教育者了解学生何时何地遇到困难。

Conclusion: CTGraph 提供了一种自监督的图级表示学习方法，能够全面分析学生的学习行为与表现，帮助教育者识别困难学生并提供针对性干预。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

Motivation: 现有的GNN在漏洞检测中容易学习虚假相关性，导致检测器在未见过的真实数据上泛化能力差。

Method: VISION框架包括：(i) 利用大型语言模型生成反事实样本；(ii) 针对具有相反标签的配对代码示例进行定向GNN训练；(iii) 基于图的解释性分析，识别关键代码语句。

Result: VISION在CWE-20漏洞上实现了整体准确率从51.8%提升至97.8%，成对对比准确率从4.5%提升至95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升至85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION框架通过生成反事实训练数据集，显著降低了GNN在漏洞检测中的虚假相关性学习，提高了检测的鲁棒性和可解释性，并在CWE-20漏洞上实现了显著的准确率提升。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

Motivation: 在消费级边缘硬件上部署MoE架构时，受限于设备内存，动态专家卸载成为关键。现有方法仅将其视为调度问题，忽视了专家重要性对准确性的影响。

Method: 通过利用专家重要性指导卸载决策，替换低重要性激活的专家为GPU内存中已缓存的功能相似专家，并引入调度策略以最大化GPU缓存专家的重用率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法降低了48%的解码延迟，专家缓存命中率超过60%，同时保持了近乎无损的准确性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于专家重要性的动态卸载策略，显著降低了内存使用和数据传输，同时保持了近乎无损的准确性。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否仅通过统计学习就能实现对社会规范的复杂理解，挑战传统认知科学中强调具身体验必要性的理论。

Method: 通过两项研究，系统评估了多个AI系统在555个日常场景中预测人类社会适宜性判断的能力，比较了模型与人类参与者在预测集体判断上的准确性。

Result: GPT-4.5在预测集体判断的准确性上超过了所有人类参与者（100百分位），Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5和Claude Sonnet 4分别超过了98.7%、97.8%和96.0%的人类参与者。所有模型均表现出系统性、相关的错误。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型仅通过统计学习就能获得对社会规范的复杂理解，挑战了强调具身体验对文化能力必要性的理论。同时，模型在不同架构中表现出的系统性局限暗示了基于模式的社会理解的潜在边界。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Conclusion: 大语言模型（LLMs）在支持边缘型人格障碍（BPD）的第一人称体验现象学定性分析中表现出可变潜力，其中Gemini的表现最接近人类分析，并展现出减少人类解释偏见的潜力。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

TL;DR: APME框架通过解题者表现数据（得分/耗时）估计题目难度，无需语言特征或专家标注，实证显示其在符号领域效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人类标注主观性强，现有NLP方法在符号领域（如代数）失效，需开发领域无关、客观的题目难度评估方法。

Method: 采用基于强化学习的多臂老虎机（MAB）框架APME，利用解题者的得分和耗时数据，通过反变异系数作为风险调整指标，实现自适应评估。

Result: 模型在三种异构数据集上验证，平均R2为0.9213，RMSE为0.0584，优于回归、NLP和IRT基线方法，尤其在符号领域表现突出。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的APME框架通过强化学习驱动的多臂老虎机方法，仅依赖解题者的表现数据（得分和耗时）即可准确估计题目难度，无需语言特征或专家标注。实证验证显示其在符号领域表现优异，平均R2达0.9213，RMSE为0.0584，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

*Congchi Yin,Tianyi Wu,Yankai Shu,Alex Gu,Yunhan Wang,Jun Shao,Xun Jiang,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new 'black-box interaction' paradigm evaluates LLMs' reasoning in unknown environments, revealing strengths in easy tasks but weaknesses in high-level planning for hard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tasks fail to assess the integrated reasoning process of LLMs in interactive, unknown environments, focusing instead on isolated reasoning types. This gap hinders the evaluation of LLMs' ability to mimic human-like discovery in the real world.

Method: A novel evaluation paradigm called 'black-box interaction' is introduced, where LLMs interact with hidden functions to unravel them through observed input-output pairs. The \textsc{Oracle} benchmark, comprising 6 types of black-box tasks and 96 black-boxes, is built to evaluate 19 modern LLMs.

Result: o3 ranks first in 5 out of 6 tasks, achieving over 70% accuracy on most easy black-boxes but dropping below 40% on hard ones.

Conclusion: LLMs, including o3, struggle with high-level planning for efficient and adaptive exploration strategies, particularly in hard black-box tasks, despite performing well in easier ones.

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Motivation: 解决智能体架构中长期存在的难题，通过自主过程间的语言交互让意图自然涌现，以实现灵活、自适应和上下文相关的行为。

Method: 采用基于LLM的模块化设计，实现完全异步操作的多个模块，通过语言介导的交互和共享全局状态来维持一致且容错的行为循环。

Result: 通过两个实际用例研究验证了系统的可行性，观察到系统具有涌现特性，支持Minsky的理论。

Conclusion: 该研究通过CMA框架验证了Minsky的"心智社会"理论，展示了复杂认知现象（如自我意识）可能源自简单过程的组织化交互，为人工智能研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

TL;DR: SST框架通过结构化模板和难度课程显著提升LLM在数学推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现模型性能与训练数据复杂性之间存在U型曲线关系（难度缩放定律），并以此为基础设计SST框架。

Method: 提出了结构化解决方案模板（SST）框架，包括微调结构化解决方案模板链、动态加权损失、提示时注入解决方案模板以及集成课程微调。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和Dynamic En基准测试中，SST显著提高了准确性和效率。

Conclusion: SST框架显著提升了LLM在复杂任务上的推理能力，尤其是在高难度问题上的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Result: 在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上，TrustEHRAgent在HCAcc@70%下比基线方法提升了44.23%p和25.34%p，基线方法在这些阈值下失效。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提出HCAcc@k%这一新指标和TrustEHRAgent代理，显著提升了在严格可靠性约束下的临床问答性能，为开发可信赖的临床AI代理提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过顺序集成外部知识检索增加了推理延迟和上下文长度，降低了连贯性和准确性。

Method: 引入HDS-QA合成数据集，训练LRMs区分并行和顺序查询，并微调出HybridDeepSearcher模型。

Result: HybridDeepSearcher在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，显著减少了推理延迟并提高了可扩展性。

Conclusion: HDS-QA和HybridDeepSearcher展示了通过显式训练LRMs混合并行和顺序查询的高效性、可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

Motivation: 随着学习系统对日常决策的影响日益加深，用户端的集体行动（如协调数据共享变更）成为监管政策和企业模型设计之外的重要补充。然而，现有研究多集中于单一集体场景，忽略了现实中分散且目标多样的多集体协同问题。

Method: 通过研究多个集体如何在分类任务中植入信号（即通过修改特征版本与目标类别的关联来偏置分类器），并结合集体规模和目标一致性的定量分析，构建了理论框架。

Result: 研究量化了集体规模与目标一致性的作用及其交互影响，并通过实证结果补充了理论框架，为多集体ACA的全面研究开辟了路径。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了首个多集体算法集体行动（ACA）的理论框架，填补了现有文献中仅关注单一集体场景的空白，为全面理解多集体在分类任务中的协同作用奠定了基础。

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Motivation: 当前人工智能发展过于注重理性决策，忽视了人类决策中的风格多样性（如信念、价值观和偏好），而风格是智能的重要但常被忽略的维度。

Method: 通过构建一个双层框架（外部环境交互循环和内部认知循环），形式化风格相关特征，并提出可测量指标（如风格容量、风格流行度和进化动态）。

Result: 研究提出了三个核心方向：(1)定义和测量游戏风格，提出基于离散状态空间的通用风格度量；(2)风格表达与生成，探索强化学习和模仿学习在训练具有特定风格倾向的智能体中的应用；(3)实际应用，分析技术在游戏设计和互动娱乐等领域的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了将'风格'作为人工智能决策行为的核心维度，并探讨了其在构建人工通用智能（AGI）中的潜在作用。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Result: MATRIX支持系统性、可扩展的安全评估，BehvJudge在240个对话的盲测中表现优于临床专家，PatBot能可靠模拟真实患者行为。

Conclusion: MATRIX框架首次将结构化安全工程与可扩展、经过验证的对话AI评估相结合，实现了符合监管要求的安全审计。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for

elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward

Conclusion: StepWiser作为一种生成式评判模型，通过元推理输出思考标记和最终裁决，显著提升了中间步骤的判断准确性，并能在训练时改进策略模型，同时优化推理时的搜索效果。

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种数字孪生引导的能源管理框架，通过强化学习和实时协议优化6G物联网网络的延迟和能源效率，取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G物联网网络的资源限制和现有管理策略缺乏实时操作，无法优化能源消耗，促使研究者提出一个更高效的能源管理框架。

Method: 研究采用了数字孪生框架，结合分布式覆盖网络和RTPS协议处理动态更新，并设计了一个带有新型奖励函数的强化学习引擎，使用DDPG算法输出连续动作。

Result: 模拟结果显示，该框架在95%延迟上提高了37%，能源消耗降低了30%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的数字孪生引导的能源管理框架在6G物联网网络中显著提高了低延迟和能源效率，通过分布式覆盖网络和实时发布订阅协议实现了动态更新，并通过强化学习引擎优化了数据更新时间。

Abstract: Although the emergence of 6G IoT networks has accelerated the deployment of
enhanced smart city services, the resource limitations of IoT devices remain as
a significant problem. Given this limitation, meeting the low-latency service
requirement of 6G networks becomes even more challenging. However, existing 6G
IoT management strategies lack real-time operation and mostly rely on discrete
actions, which are insufficient to optimise energy consumption. To address
these, in this study, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-guided energy management
framework to jointly handle the low latency and energy efficiency challenges in
6G IoT networks. In this framework, we provide the twin models through a
distributed overlay network and handle the dynamic updates between the data
layer and the upper layers of the DT over the Real-Time Publish Subscribe
(RTPS) protocol. We also design a Reinforcement Learning (RL) engine with a
novel formulated reward function to provide optimal data update times for each
of the IoT devices. The RL engine receives a diverse set of environment states
from the What-if engine and runs Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to
output continuous actions to the IoT devices. Based on our simulation results,
we observe that the proposed framework achieves a 37% improvement in 95th
percentile latency and a 30% reduction in energy consumption compared to the
existing literature.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种分层无人机群结构，用于6G空中接入网络，通过优化部署和轨迹，显著降低了复杂度和能耗。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as aerial base stations (BSs) to
extend the ubiquitous connectivity for ground users (GUs) in the
sixth-generation (6G) era. However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy
multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we
propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks,
where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible
for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory
of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem
(MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as
well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer
nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and
Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to
establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated
sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal
solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted
to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline
mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks and the
Internet of Things (IoT) has catalyzed the evolution from centralized cloud
intelligence towards decentralized edge general intelligence. However,
traditional edge intelligence methods, characterized by static models and
limited cognitive autonomy, fail to address the dynamic, heterogeneous, and
resource-constrained scenarios inherent to emerging edge networks. Agentic
artificial intelligence (Agentic AI) emerges as a transformative solution,
enabling edge systems to autonomously perceive multimodal environments, reason
contextually, and adapt proactively through continuous
perception-reasoning-action loops. In this context, the agentification of edge
intelligence serves as a key paradigm shift, where distributed entities evolve
into autonomous agents capable of collaboration and continual adaptation. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey dedicated to Agentic AI and
agentification frameworks tailored explicitly for edge general intelligence.
First, we systematically introduce foundational concepts and clarify
distinctions from traditional edge intelligence paradigms. Second, we analyze
important enabling technologies, including compact model compression,
energy-aware computing strategies, robust connectivity frameworks, and advanced
knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms. Third, we provide
representative case studies demonstrating Agentic AI's capabilities in
low-altitude economy networks, intent-driven networking, vehicular networks,
and human-centric service provisioning, supported by numerical evaluations.
Furthermore, we identify current research challenges, review emerging
open-source platforms, and highlight promising future research directions to
guide robust, scalable, and trustworthy Agentic AI deployments for
next-generation edge environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices in smart cities,
transportation, healthcare, and industrial applications, coupled with the
explosive growth of AI-driven services, has increased demands for efficient
distributed computing architectures and networks, driving cloud-edge-terminal
collaborative intelligence (CETCI) as a fundamental paradigm within the

Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards that enables the
industry to provide real-time guarantees for time-critical communications with
Ethernet hardware. TSN supports various queuing and scheduling mechanisms and
allows the integration of multiple traffic types in a single network. Network
Calculus (NC) can be used to calculate upper bounds for latencies and buffer
sizes within these networks, for example, for safety or real-time traffic. We
explain the relevance of NC for TSN-based computer communications and potential
areas of application. Different NC analysis approaches have been published to
examine different parts of TSN and this paper provides a survey of these
publications and presents their main results, dependencies, and differences. We
present a consistent presentation of the most important results and suggest an
improvement to model the output of sending end-devices. To ease access to the
current research status, we introduce a common notation to show how all results
depend on each other and also identify common assumptions. Thus, we offer a
comprehensive overview of NC for industrial networks and identify possible
areas for future work.

TL;DR: 本文研究了边缘计算中数据压缩与传输的能源-延迟-可靠性权衡，发现略微放宽延迟要求可大幅节能，挑战了传统严格延迟目标。


<details>

Motivation: 随着边缘计算的出现，终端设备生成的数据可以在传输前进行预处理，可能节省传输时间和能源。然而，数据处理本身也会带来延迟和能耗，这取决于计算操作的复杂性和处理器的速度。本文旨在研究这种多维优化问题。

Method: 本文引入了一个简单的模型来研究在受限无线设备中考虑压缩和通信操作时，端到端延迟、可靠性和能耗之间的权衡关系，并研究了以数据压缩比和设备处理速度为关键设计变量的能量-延迟权衡的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 本文的结论表明，通过略微放宽应用的延迟要求可以显著节省能源，这挑战了传统的严格通信延迟目标，并提倡考虑计算和传输开销的特定应用端到端延迟预算。

Abstract: With the advent of edge computing, data generated by end devices can be
pre-processed before transmission, possibly saving transmission time and
energy. On the other hand, data processing itself incurs latency and energy
consumption, depending on the complexity of the computing operations and the
speed of the processor. The energy-latency-reliability profile resulting from
the concatenation of pre-processing operations (specifically, data compression)
and data transmission is particularly relevant in wireless communication
services, whose requirements may change dramatically with the application
domain. In this paper, we study this multi-dimensional optimization problem,
introducing a simple model to investigate the tradeoff among end-to-end
latency, reliability, and energy consumption when considering compression and
communication operations in a constrained wireless device. We then study the
Pareto fronts of the energy-latency trade-off, considering data compression
ratio and device processing speed as key design variables. Our results show
that the energy costs grows exponentially with the reduction of the end-to-end
latency, so that considerable energy saving can be obtained by slightly
relaxing the latency requirements of applications. These findings challenge
conventional rigid communication latency targets, advocating instead for
application-specific end-to-end latency budgets that account for computational
and transmission overhead.

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合离线网络优化启发式与在线准入控制，成功实现了对静态和动态流量网络的截止时间保证资源分配，显著提高了网络质量和运行时效率，同时仅需最小用户输入。

Abstract: To support reliable and low-latency communication, Time-Sensitive Networking
introduced protocols and interfaces for resource allocation in Ethernet.
However, the implementation of these allocation algorithms has not yet been
covered by the standards. Our work focuses on deadline-guaranteeing resource
allocation for networks with static and dynamic traffic. To achieve this, we
combine offline network optimization heuristics with online admission control
and, thus, allow for new flow registrations while the network is running. We
demonstrate our solution on Credit-Based Shaper networks by using the delay
analysis framework Network Calculus. We compare our approach with an intuitive
and a brute-force algorithm, where we can achieve significant improvements,
both, in terms of quality and runtime. Thereby, our results show that we can
guarantee maximum end-to-end delays and also increase the flexibility of the
network while requiring only minimal user input.

and the DSM is ensured by the self-organizing KIRA routing protocol. The
demonstrated system enables scalable, zero-touch connectivity and supports
nomadic SNs through seamless discovery and reconfiguration. SNs are implemented
for modular Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios, as well as for
mission-critical control loops and for logistics or nomadic behavior. The DSM
framework dynamically adapts spectrum allocation to meet real-time demands

Motivation: LEO卫星网络的动态性带来非拥塞性延迟变化、瞬态热点和频繁切换等挑战，现有传输协议无法有效应对。

Result: LeoTCP在吞吐量和延迟方面均优于现有协议。

Conclusion: LeoTCP显著提高了LEO卫星网络中的数据传输效率，同时最小化延迟，优于现有协议。

Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks consist of thousands of satellites
orbiting the Earth, enabling low-latency and high-throughput communications
across the globe. Such networks present unprecedented challenges due to their
dynamic nature, which state-of-the-art data transport protocols do not address.
These challenges include: (1) non-congestive latency variation and loss, caused
by continuous satellite movement and fluctuating link quality due to weather
effects; (2) transient hotspots leading to buffer build-up, latency inflation,
and potential packet loss; and (3) frequent handovers, which may result in
temporary connectivity loss and re-routing through paths with unknown
congestion and delay characteristics. In this paper, we introduce LeoTCP, a
novel data transport protocol designed specifically to address these
challenges. LeoTCP leverages in-network telemetry (INT) to gather congestion
information on a per-hop basis. Using this information, LeoTCP (1) minimises
both buffer occupancy and latency for end users, (2) maximises application
throughput and network utilisation, and (3) swiftly reacts to network hotspots.
We compare LeoTCP to state-of-the-art data transport protocols using a LEO
satellite simulation model and targeted micro-benchmarks, both based on
OMNeT++/INET. The simulation model captures RTT dynamics in a simulated LEO
satellite constellation, while the micro-benchmarks isolate key LEO-specific
characteristics, including non-congestive latency variation and loss, path
changes, and congestion hotspots. Our results demonstrate that LeoTCP
significantly increases goodput compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches, while simultaneously minimising latency.

Leveraging stochastic geometry, our framework enables the systematic assessment

Furthermore, our results allow us to characterizing how the benefits of network
sharing vary as a function of the geographical and functional characteristics

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个理论框架来解决分布式目标导向多址（GoMA）问题，证明了问题的非凸性并可能有多重纳什均衡解。通过优化方法达到纳什均衡，性能优于集中式方法，同时降低了能耗。

Abstract: The Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) paradigm breaks the separation between
communication and the content of the data, tailoring communication decisions to
the specific needs of the receiver and targeting application performance. While
recent studies show impressive encoding performance in point-to-point
scenarios, the multi-node distributed scenario is still almost unexplored.
Moreover, the few studies to investigate this consider a centralized
collision-free approach, where a central scheduler decides the transmission
order of the nodes. In this work, we address the Goal-oriented Multiple Access
(GoMA) problem, in which multiple intelligent agents must coordinate to share a
wireless channel and avoid mutual interference. We propose a theoretical
framework for the analysis and optimization of distributed GoMA, serving as a
first step towards its complete characterization. We prove that the problem is
non-convex and may admit multiple Nash Equilibrium (NE) solutions. We provide a
characterization of each node's best response to others' strategies and propose
an optimization approach that provably reaches one such NE, outperforming
centralized approaches by up to 100% while also reducing energy consumption. We
also design a distributed learning algorithm that operates with limited
feedback and no prior knowledge.
