However, because\nthey have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant\nperformance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We\nexamine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in\nmany data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit\nfloating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower\nprecision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit\naccumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so\nhigh that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor\ncore Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational\nthroughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and\nmaximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and\nregisters). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which\ntypically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean\ndistance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean\ndistance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two\nsingle precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index.

FL can be categorized into centralized and\ndecentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to\naggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,\ncommunication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the\ndecentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides\nimproved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in\nleveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this\napproach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal\nmodels in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this\nchallenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),\nwhich replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk\nupdates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized\nversions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data\nand introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial\nrandom walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model\nupdate.

The proposed solution estimates body-frame\nvelocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction\ninformation from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data.\nThis fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer,\nwhich operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The\nestimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an\noptional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on\n$\\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation.

To extract\nthe velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent\nalgorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit\nsphere.

By doing so, our method\nsignificantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept\nrelevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation\nVectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We\nconduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating\nthat our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,\nenhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial\nperturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent\nframework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable\nunderstanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts.

However, the high cost and\ntime-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of\nlarge-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of\nadvanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address\nthis critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework\nfor generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D\nfingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D\nstyle transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale\nimages mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D\nStructure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D\nanatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that\nrenders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other\nimaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale\nsynthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the\nhigh quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition\nperformance.

We introduce\nX-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays\nunder varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared\nto diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains\nflexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual\nfidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable\nsolution for domain adaptation in medical imaging.

It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and\ncorrelate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the\nsearch space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby\naffecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search\nusing several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in\nMulti-Heuristic A* (MHA*).

The\nautoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive\nsegmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present\nour submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,\nwe extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided\nforeground and background clicks as additional input channels. We\nsystematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate\nthat Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform\nGaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user\ninteractions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under\nrealistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with\nand without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,\nreducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.\nThese results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,\nuser-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT.

In this paper, we are\ninterested in asking: \\textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in\nthe learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting\nof various types of unusual atypical data (\\eg sci-fi, animation, \\etc). To\nstudy how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into\nthe model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key\ntasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel\ncategory discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found\nthat even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently\nimprove performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that\nincreasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD\ndetection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more\nsemantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance\ncompared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the\nsemantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to\nunseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental\nevaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation\nlearning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,\nencouraging further studies in this direction."}

We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the\nunder-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos\nrepresent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in\nmany applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in\nunsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised\ncontinual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,\nwhile having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we\nstudy the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more\nchallenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of\nprocessing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark\nexperimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured\nvideo data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised\nvideo transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of\nthe data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task\ndata, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture\nnew knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of\ntransfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge\ntransfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology\nsubstantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning\nmany tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action\nrecognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,\nwithout using any labels or class boundaries."}

Specifically, given an input image, the model\nmust first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify\nthe participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),\nand finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).\nExisting methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we\nshow through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address\nthe inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories\nmay reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key\ncontributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb\nclassification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous\nsemantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of\nfully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to\nreformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning\n(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a\ncomprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully\ndesigned to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To\naddress the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb\nMultilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to\ncapture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision\nboundaries.

This regularization discourages\nextreme anisotropy-specifically, \"needle-like\" shapes-by favoring more\nbalanced, \"disk-like\" forms that are better suited for stable surface\nreconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance\nFunction (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an\nEikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous\nglobal surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the\nunderlying geometry.
