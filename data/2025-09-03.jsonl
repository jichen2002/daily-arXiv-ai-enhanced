Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant\ncomputation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the\ncorresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these\nLLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large\nand requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.\n  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high\nloading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To\nincrease the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression\nas a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the\ncompression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache\nentry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly\ndegrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines\nacross three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at\nthe same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay."}

However, existing methods face two key limitations: (i) an\nincomplete classification of hyper-vertex triangle structures, typically\nconsidering only inner or outer triangles; and (ii) inflexible sampling schemes\nthat predefine the number of sampled hyperedges, which is impractical under\nstrict memory constraints due to highly variable hyperedge sizes. To address\nthese challenges, we first introduce a complete classification of hyper-vertex\ntriangles, including inner, hybrid, and outer triangles. Based on this, we\ndevelop HTCount, a reservoir-based algorithm that dynamically adjusts the\nsample size based on the available memory M. To further improve memory\nutilization and reduce estimation error, we develop HTCount-P, a\npartition-based variant that adaptively partitions unused memory into\nindependent sample subsets. We provide theoretical analysis of the unbiasedness\nand variance bounds of the proposed algorithms. Case studies demonstrate the\nexpressiveness of our triangle structures in revealing meaningful interaction\npatterns.

This significantly limits model accuracy and\nscalability under stringent hardware resource constraints.\n  We present SPLIDT, a system that rethinks DT deployment in the data plane by\nenabling partitioned inference over sliding windows of packets. SPLIDT\nintroduces two key innovations: (1) it assigns distinct, variable feature sets\nto individual sub-trees of a DT, grouped into partitions, and (2) it leverages\nan in-band control channel (via recirculation) to reuse data-plane resources\n(both stateful registers and match keys) across partitions at line rate.

Agents are visually\nrepresented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of\nthree classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)\ndatasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving\nneighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with\nmovement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative\nemotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,\nemotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of\nexperiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and\nscenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy\nclassifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,\nemotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By\ncontrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional\nclusters and resilience to emotional disruptions.

Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery.

We apply this result to computing\nparameterized squares.\n  A parameterized square is a string of the form $XY$ such that $X$ and $Y$\nparameterized-match, i.e., there exists a bijection $f$ on the alphabet such\nthat $f(X) = Y$. Two parameterized squares $XY$ and $X'Y'$ are equivalent if\nthey parameterized match. Recently Hamai et al. [SPIRE 2024] showed that a\nstring of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$ contains less than\n$n\\sigma$ non-equivalent parameterized squares, improving an earlier bound by\nKociumaka et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci., 2016]. We apply our bound for\n$k$-mismatch repeats to propose an algorithm that reports all non-equivalent\nparameterized squares in $O(n\\sigma \\log \\sigma)$ time. We also show that the\nnumber of non-equivalent parameterized squares can be computed in $O(n \\log n)$\ntime. This last algorithm applies to squares under any substring compatible\nequivalence relation and also to counting squares that are distinct as strings.\nIn particular, this improves upon the $O(n\\sigma)$-time algorithm of\nGawrychowski et al. [CPM 2023] for counting order-preserving squares that are\ndistinct as strings if $\\sigma = \\omega(\\log n)$."}

A key challenge in such a system\nis to ensure system stability for any ``tractable'' pattern of generated\ntransactions; this is modeled by an adversary generating transactions with a\ncertain rate of at most $\\rho$ and burstiness $b$. This model captures\nworst-case scenarios and even some attacks on transactions' processing, e.g.,\nDoS. A stable system ensures bounded transaction queue sizes and bounded\ntransaction latency. It is known that the absolute upper bound on the maximum\ninjection rate for which any scheduler could guarantee bounded queues and\nlatency of transactions is $\\max\\left\\{ \\frac{2}{k+1}, \\frac{2}{\n\\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{2s}\\right\\rfloor}\\right\\}$, where $k$ is the maximum number\nof shards that each transaction accesses.

In this\ncontext, the age of information (AoI) has emerged as a critical performance\nmetric for evaluating the freshness and timeliness of transmitted information\nin Internet of things (IoT) networks. However, conventional AAV-assisted data\ntransmission is fundamentally limited by finite communication coverage ranges,\nwhich requires periodic return flights for data relay operations. This\npropulsion-repositioning cycle inevitably introduces latency spikes that raise\nthe AoI while degrading service reliability. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a AAV-assisted forwarding system based on distributed\nbeamforming to enhance the AoI in IoT. Specifically, AAVs collaborate via\ndistributed beamforming to collect and relay data between the sensor nodes and\nremote base station. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the\nAoI and AAV energy consumption, by jointly optimizing the AAV trajectories and\ncommunication schedules. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem and its\npronounced temporal variability, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning\nsolution that incorporates temporal sequence input, layer normalization gated\nrecurrent unit, and a squeeze-and-excitation block to capture long-term\ndependencies, thereby improving decision-making stability and accuracy, and\nreducing computational complexity.

Specifically, we introduce a novel\nLanguage-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three\ncomplementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and\nthe textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\npenalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the\ntext-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss\nbased on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed\nfine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and\nexplore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,\nwe observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of\nadapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot\nsetting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms\nthe very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields\nsignificant gains over the best-performing inductive methods.

This scheduling problem is a restless\nmulti-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with a non-separable penalty function.

By\ndistributing the model between edge devices and a central server, eEnergy-Split\nreduces on-device energy usage by up to 86 percent compared to federated\nlearning (FL) while safeguarding data privacy. Moreover, SL improves\nclassification accuracy by up to 6.2 percent over FL on ResNet-18 and by more\nmodest amounts on GoogleNet and MobileNetV2. We propose an optimal edge\ndeployment algorithm and a UAV trajectory planning strategy that solves the\nTraveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exactly to minimize flight cost and extend and\nmaximize communication rounds. Comprehensive evaluations on agricultural pest\ndatasets reveal that eEnergy-Split lowers UAV energy consumption compared to\nbaseline methods and boosts overall accuracy by up to 17 percent. Notably, the\nenergy efficiency of SL is shown to be model-dependent-yielding substantial\nsavings in lightweight models like MobileNet, while communication and memory\noverheads may reduce efficiency gains in deeper networks. These results\nhighlight the potential of combining SL with energy-aware design to deliver a\nscalable, privacy-preserving solution for resource-constrained smart farming\nenvironments."}

However, numerous\naccident reports show that ADSs still encounter challenges in complex\nscenarios. As a result, scenario-based testing has become essential for\nidentifying defects and ensuring reliable performance. In particular,\nreal-world accident reports offer valuable high-risk scenarios for more\ntargeted ADS testing. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on\nvisual data, which demands large memory and manual annotation. Additionally,\nsince existing methods do not adopt standardized scenario formats (e.g.,\nOpenSCENARIO), the generated scenarios are often tied to specific platforms and\nADS implementations, limiting their scalability and portability. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Txt2Sce, a method for generating test scenarios in\nOpenSCENARIO format based on textual accident reports. Txt2Sce first uses a LLM\nto convert textual accident reports into corresponding OpenSCENARIO scenario\nfiles. It then generates a derivation-based scenario file tree through scenario\ndisassembly, scenario block mutation, and scenario assembly. By utilizing the\nderivation relationships between nodes in the scenario tree, Txt2Sce helps\ndevelopers identify the scenario conditions that trigger unexpected behaviors\nof ADSs. In the experiments, we employ Txt2Sce to generate 33 scenario file\ntrees, resulting in a total of 4,373 scenario files for testing the open-source\nADS, Autoware. The experimental results show that Txt2Sce successfully converts\ntextual reports into valid OpenSCENARIO files, enhances scenario diversity\nthrough mutation, and effectively detects unexpected behaviors of Autoware in\nterms of safety, smartness, and smoothness."}

One is\nthat dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other\nis that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we\nstudy the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both\nthe long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge\nwith the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a\nmean-squared-variance (M2V) objective.

To determine the relevant data from prior\ndatasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data\npoint's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.\nWhile retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data\nselection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel\ndensity (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution.

On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the\nbrain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image\ngeneration capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain\nencoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with\nsufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this\nproblem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as\nexisting approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses\nto validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our\nframework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP\nvisual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,\nand a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct\nbiologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike\nconventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for\nconditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between\nvisual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained\nalignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two\nmultimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its\neffectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we\nvisualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both\ndatasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and\ninter-subject variations in M/EEG signals."}

To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population.

However, pose-based\nscoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the\nscarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and\nnoise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of\nsubtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce\nScoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original\nScoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050\nadolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation\nFramework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial\nstructure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes\nclinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)\nmodule further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from\nthe skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries.

Secondly, a\nvisual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes\ninto the degraded generation process.

To achieve this goal, we develop a crop\nmechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further\npropose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position\nbetween the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly\nincreases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which\nenables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods\nin 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the\nself-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three\nvariants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol.

One such approach to few-shot\nimitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts\nrelevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a\nlimited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior\ndatasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data\npoint's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.\nWhile retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data\nselection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel\ndensity (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two\nshortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on\nhigh-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,\nit does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To\naddress these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which\nestimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data\ndistributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the\nprobability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,\nand by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates\nusing all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world\nevaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently\nimproves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only\nrequiring minor modifications."}

We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for\npost-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather\nthan model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched\nachieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn\nquantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,\nwhich combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for\nfine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of\ncalibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.\nQ-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16\n4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step\nPhased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation\nare complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with\nmore than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both\nFLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo."}

While this approach\nachieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles\nwith precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced\ndivision of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a\ntranslator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the\ngeneration module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring\nthe original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the\nnew content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding\nmodule is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning\ntasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce\nDraw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)\nDIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex\ninstruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K\nchain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design\nblueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable\nSANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM\ndataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit.

This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal\nAdaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy\nlabels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution\nLearning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in\nordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and\nstandard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than\ndiscarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and\nmake optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)\nand disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric\nGaussian noise scenarios.

While this approach\nachieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles\nwith precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced\ndivision of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a\ntranslator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the\ngeneration module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring\nthe original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the\nnew content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding\nmodule is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning\ntasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce\nDraw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)\nDIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex\ninstruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K\nchain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design\nblueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable\nSANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM\ndataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit.

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space\nthroughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the\nflexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,\nboth of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.\nIn the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground\nand background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional\ncontextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level\nfeatures. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the\noriginal reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a\nfeature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation.

For example, vision-based object-relative\nnavigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the\nrelative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's\nstate estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep\nNeural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state\nestimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we\nshow that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor\nfor aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer\nperceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL\npredictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing\npre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as\na measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman\nfilter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the\nstate estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the\ndynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of\nthe object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance\napproach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to\nunderline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the\nobject-relative state estimation task."}
