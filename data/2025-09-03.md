Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMMKD通过多模态融合和多教师蒸馏，实现了轻量高效的图像-文本检索模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言预训练模型在移动设备上的部署受限，主要由于模型大小和计算复杂度高。

Method: AMMKD框架包括多模态特征融合网络、多教师知识蒸馏（使用两个CLIP教师模型）、KL散度进行概率分布匹配，以及自适应动态加权方案。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，AMMKD在显著降低模型复杂度的同时，实现了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: AMMKD框架通过多模态特征融合、多教师知识蒸馏和自适应优化，显著降低了模型复杂度，同时保持了高性能，验证了其有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

*Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MESTI和MEGANet，显著提升微表情识别性能，在多个数据集上达到最高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输入模态（如Apex Frame、Optical Flow和Dynamic Image）难以捕捉微表情的细微短暂特征，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种新的动态输入模态MESTI和包含梯度注意力块的MEGANet网络，以增强微表情特征的提取。

Result: MESTI和MEGANet在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上取得了最先进的性能，且MESTI替换现有网络输入后性能一致提升。

Conclusion: MESTI和MEGANet的组合在微表情识别任务中达到了最高准确率，为未来更有效的MER系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

### [6] [Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062)
*Justin Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaffold Diffusion是一种生成稀疏多类别3D体素结构的模型，通过离散扩散语言模型实现，即使在极高稀疏度下也能生成逼真结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成逼真的稀疏多类别3D体素结构具有挑战性，主要由于体素结构的立方内存缩放和稀疏性导致的显著类别不平衡。

Method: 通过将体素视为令牌，Scaffold Diffusion使用离散扩散语言模型生成3D体素结构。

Result: 在3D-Craft数据集的Minecraft房屋结构上评估表明，Scaffold Diffusion能够生成逼真且连贯的结构，即使在训练数据稀疏度超过98%的情况下。

Conclusion: 离散扩散作为一种有前景的框架，为3D稀疏体素生成建模提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [7] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGLC框架通过全局和局部特征结合，有效提升高分辨率图像去雾效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去雾模型在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，主要因为难以有效结合全局上下文信息和局部精细细节。

Method: 提出了Streamlined Global and Local Features Combinator (SGLC)框架，包含Global Features Generator (GFG)和Local Features Enhancer (LFE)两个主要组件，分别处理全局场景理解和局部细节增强。

Result: 实验结果表明，SGLC在高分辨率数据集上显著提升了PSNR值，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: SGLC框架通过结合全局和局部特征，显著提升了高分辨率图像去雾的效果，且具有模型无关性，可广泛应用于现有去雾网络。

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

### [8] [Self-supervised large-scale kidney abnormality detection in drug safety assessment studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00131)
*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种大规模自监督异常检测模型，用于肾脏毒性病理学，旨在通过排除正常切片来降低药物开发成本和时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾脏异常检测是临床前药物开发中必需的，但涉及对数百至数千张全切片图像的耗时且昂贵的检查，大多数是正常的，以检测任何表明毒性效应的细微变化。

Method: 本研究探索了在大规模上使用从UNI基础模型（FM）提取的特征进行肾脏异常检测的复杂性，并展示了在相同特征上应用自监督方法可以实现优于随机猜测的性能。

Result: 自监督方法在相同特征上实现了优于随机猜测的性能，接收者操作特征曲线下面积为0.62，阴性预测值为89%。

Conclusion: 通过进一步开发，这种模型可以用于排除药物安全性评估研究中的正常切片，从而降低药物开发的成本和时间。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Method: 引入了一个专为真实世界废物分类设计的新数据集，并提出了全面的评估方法来严格测试VLLMs的鲁棒性和准确性。

Result: 研究揭示了VLLMs在复杂环境中的性能局限性，并提出了进一步改进的方向。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在复杂环境中提升视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）鲁棒性的必要性，并为未来研究提供了公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under
challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further
advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments.
The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

*Faizan Farooq Khan,Vladan Stojnić,Zakaria Laskar,Mohamed Elhoseiny,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出结合生成模型和视觉模型的两步法，显著提升文本到图像检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有视觉与语言模型（如CLIP）在文本和图像表示空间中的模态差距问题，寻求提升检索性能的解决方案。

Method: 采用两步法：首先使用生成扩散模型将文本查询转换为视觉查询，然后利用视觉模型估计图像间相似性，并通过聚合网络整合多模态查询结果。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在性能上持续优于仅依赖文本查询的检索方法。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合生成扩散模型和视觉模型，提出了一种新的文本到图像检索方法，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出PRISM基准和Safe-LLaVA数据集，用于评估和减少MLLMs中的生物特征泄露，显著提升隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但会推断并泄露敏感的生物特征属性，这在现实应用和社会敏感领域中引发严重隐私问题。

Method: 引入PRISM基准和Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统移除LLaVA数据集中的显性和隐性生物特征信息，构建首个隐私保护的MLLM训练数据集。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs存在广泛的生物特征泄露，而基于Safe-LLaVA微调的模型显著减少了泄露。

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA和PRISM为MLLMs的隐私对齐开发和评估设定了新标准，显著减少了生物特征泄露。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at
https://github.com/Kimyounggun99/Safe-LLaVA.git.

TL;DR: VEME提出一种跨模态对齐方法，通过动态认知地图和时空经验嵌入，提升视觉语言模型在动态环境中的推理和规划能力，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在时空推理和动态开放任务中的局限性，如任务导向导航和具身问答，因对细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解的不足。

Method: VEME框架包含三个关键组件：(1)跨模态对齐框架，增强视觉语言模型的情境学习；(2)动态隐式认知地图，激活任务相关的几何-语义记忆；(3)基于指令的导航与推理框架，利用先验知识进行长期规划和高效探索。

Result: 在VSI-Bench和VLN-CE上的实验显示，相比传统方法，VEME在准确率和探索效率上提升1%-3%。

Conclusion: VEME方法通过跨模态对齐和动态认知地图，显著提升了在动态环境中的推理和规划能力，实验结果显示1%-3%的准确率和探索效率提升。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多模态深度学习框架，结合超声图像和临床数据，显著提高了乳腺叶状肿瘤的分类准确性，减少了不必要的手术活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions.

Method: We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage.

Result: The results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and 0.7294, respectively.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural

### [15] [A High-Accuracy Fast Hough Transform with Linear-Log-Cubed Computational Complexity for Arbitrary-Shaped Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00231)
*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出$FHT2SP$算法，结合快速与高精度的Hough变换，通过超像素扩展实现高效计算与恒定误差控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的快速Hough变换算法（如FHT）在计算复杂度与精度之间存在权衡：快速算法（如$FHT2DT$）在任意图像尺寸下效率高但精度随尺寸下降，而高精度算法计算成本接近立方级。因此，需要一种既能保持高精度又具备高效计算复杂度的算法。

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，将其扩展至任意形状，并整合到$FHT2DT$算法中，通过选择适当的超像素尺寸，实现了计算复杂度和精度的平衡。

Result: $FHT2SP$算法在$w \times h$图像上实现了接近最优的计算复杂度$\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$，同时保持近似误差为与图像尺寸无关的常数，且可通过超参数控制。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为$FHT2SP$的新算法，该算法在保持计算复杂度接近最优的同时，实现了高精度的Hough变换。通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了该算法在不同图像尺寸下均能保持恒定误差边界，并通过超参数可控。

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语言引导的生成视觉系统，用于制造业残留轮廓检测，通过三阶段流程实现CAD级精度，并验证了VLM引导工作流的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统常受噪声、材料变异性和非受控成像条件的影响，限制了传统边缘检测器和手工流程的效果。

Method: 系统分为三个阶段：数据采集与预处理、使用条件GAN生成轮廓，以及通过视觉语言建模进行多模态轮廓细化。

Result: 在FabTrack数据集上，该系统提高了轮廓保真度，增强了边缘连续性和几何对齐，同时减少了手动追踪。GPT-image-1在标准化条件下表现优于Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: 研究展示了基于视觉语言模型（VLM）引导的生成工作流在工业计算机视觉中的潜力，能够超越传统流程的限制。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出LIMO损失函数，结合互信息、KL散度和交叉熵，显著提升transductive few-shot CLIP性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨了transductive few-shot学习在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的潜力，并指出需要针对VLMs定制的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO)损失函数，结合了视觉输入与文本类别描述的互信息、KL散度惩罚和标准交叉熵损失。

Result: LIMO在transductive few-shot CLIP任务中大幅领先现有方法，并在性能上显著优于最佳归纳方法。

Conclusion: LIMO方法在transductive few-shot CLIP任务中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，证明了参数高效微调（PEFT）策略的有效性。

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

TL;DR: MorphGen通过建模核形态和空间组织，在监督对比学习中学习了对领域偏移和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性的癌症表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算组织病理学中的领域泛化受限于全切片图像的异质性，而病理学家依赖领域不变的形态学特征进行诊断，因此提出建模生物学稳健的核形态和空间组织以学习对领域偏移具有弹性的癌症表示。

Method: 提出MorphGen方法，结合组织病理学图像、增强技术和核分割掩码，采用监督对比学习框架，并引入随机权重平均（SWA）以增强分布外鲁棒性。

Result: MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类，学习到的表示对图像破坏（如染色伪影）和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MorphGen通过整合组织病理学图像、增强技术和核分割掩码，在监督对比学习框架中学习了对领域偏移具有弹性的癌症表示，展示了在数字病理学中的OOD泛化能力和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的视觉令牌修剪策略，通过互信息和嵌入空间距离最大化减少冗余令牌，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在处理视觉输入时生成密集的令牌序列，导致计算和内存成本增加。现有令牌修剪方法依赖昂贵的校准或次优的重要性度量，导致保留冗余令牌。

Method: 提出了一种基于互信息的视觉令牌修剪策略，通过移除与文本令牌语义不匹配的视觉令牌来保持跨模态对齐，并通过最大化嵌入空间中的成对距离来修剪冗余视觉令牌。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B等模型上减少了88.9%的令牌，推理速度提升了56.7%，同时保持了强劲的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的视觉令牌修剪策略在保持跨模态对齐和模态内信息多样性的同时，显著减少了计算和内存成本，提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

Conclusion: LUT-Fuse方法在效率和性能上取得了显著突破，适用于各种场景，甚至在低功耗移动设备上也能保持高运行速度。

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Conclusion: 本研究为CAVs中的联邦学习目标检测提供了首个全面的部署导向评估，整合了模型性能、系统级资源分析和环境鲁棒性，为CAVs中稳健的FL部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Motivation: 现有的单域泛化方法通常忽视目标环境的文本描述这一可用资源，导致模型在分布变化下表现不佳。本研究旨在利用这些文本描述来指导模型泛化。

Method: STAR模块通过目标锚定的子空间对图像特征进行重新中心化，并利用谱投影保留与目标线索对齐的方向，同时丢弃源特定的噪声。此外，还采用了视觉语言蒸馏和特征空间Mixup技术来优化特征表示。

Result: 在多个图像分类和目标检测基准测试中，STAR模块表现出色，证明了其在数据受限情况下的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种名为STAR的轻量级模块，通过利用视觉语言模型（如CLIP）将目标语义注入源特征，显著提升了模型在目标环境中的泛化能力。实验证明，即使在没有目标数据的情况下，仅利用目标环境的文本描述也能显著改善模型性能。

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）去噪是后续任务的关键预处理步骤。干净的HSI通常存在于低维子空间中，可以通过低秩和稀疏表示来捕捉，这是HSI的物理先验。然而，如何有效利用这些物理特性进行去噪并同时保留图像细节是一个普遍的挑战。

Method: ILRNet是一种结合模型驱动和数据驱动的方法，通过嵌入秩最小化模块（RMM）在U-Net架构中，利用HSI的光谱低秩特性进行去噪。

Result: 实验结果表明，ILRNet在合成和真实噪声去除任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新型的迭代低秩网络（ILRNet），用于高光谱图像（HSI）去噪，该方法通过结合模型驱动和数据驱动的方法，显著提高了去噪效果。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

cancer research. The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients
with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10
international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered
PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical
diversity across institutions. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved
lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists
and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control
measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with
expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a
subset of patients, and comprehensive clinical metadata. This metadata includes
TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up
outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We
demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks:
automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV
status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep
learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic
frameworks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个两阶段防御框架，通过激活干预和偏好优化提升视觉语言模型的鲁棒性，同时保持良性任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖任务特定对比提示，性能次优且可能损害视觉基础能力，需一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出了SPO-VLM，一个结合激活层面干预和政策层面优化的两阶段防御框架。第一阶段计算自适应层特定转向向量，第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化进一步优化这些向量。

Result: 实验表明SPO-VLM在增强安全性的同时，不损害视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: SPO-VLM通过两阶段防御框架有效提升了视觉语言模型的鲁棒性，同时保持了良性任务上的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

Method: 提出了自适应点提示调谐（APPT）方法，通过聚合局部几何生成点嵌入，利用线性层确保预训练模型的直接使用，并通过置换不变特征捕获位置信息。引入提示生成器动态生成点提示，减少计算开销。

Result: APPT方法在无需异构映射的情况下，以少量参数直接处理点云，有效捕获空间特征并优化自注意力机制，显著提升了3D点云分析的性能。

Conclusion: APPT方法通过直接利用点特征校准异构基础模型，为3D点云分析提供了一个通用的、参数高效的微调框架，避免了传统方法中的空间几何损失和异构映射问题。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

*Shumpei Takezaki,Ryoma Bise,Shinnosuke Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseCutMix结合扩散模型和CutMix，生成自然高分辨率图像，提升数据增强效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据增强方法（如CutMix和MixUp）在结合多类图像时，常因上下文差异导致不自然的边界，因此需要一种更自然的方法来生成融合多类特征的图像。

Method: 提出了一种名为NoiseCutMix的新方法，通过在扩散模型中部分结合两个不同类别的估计噪声，实现自然且高分辨率的图像生成。

Result: 在分类实验中，NoiseCutMix相比传统数据增强技术和随机图像生成方法表现更优。

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix方法通过结合扩散模型和CutMix的优点，成功生成了自然且高分辨率的图像，增强了数据增强的多样性，并在分类实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

Motivation: 传统3D LiDAR点云分析方法需要大量标注数据，成本高且耗时。相比之下，2D图像数据集资源丰富且规模大，本研究旨在利用2D数据减少3D标注的负担。

Method: 提出了两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法：无监督域适应知识蒸馏（UDAKD）和基于特征与语义的知识蒸馏（FSKD），利用预训练的2D图像模型与未标注的2D数据，通过已知的2D-3D对应关系进行知识蒸馏。

Conclusion: 通过提出的两种跨模态知识蒸馏方法（UDAKD和FSKD），本研究成功减少了3D LiDAR点云标注的需求，同时保持了高性能，超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

Motivation: 自我中心视频中频繁且突然的视角变化导致对象外观变化和部分遮挡，现有方法难以实现准确定位。

Method: 提出了Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization (HERO-VQL)方法，包括Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG)和Egocentric Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT)。TAG利用类令牌和高层上下文优化注意力机制，EgoACT通过增强查询多样性和模拟极端视角变化提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的大量实验验证了HERO-VQL方法的有效性，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL方法通过结合自上而下的注意力引导和以自我为中心的增强一致性训练，有效解决了自我中心视频中对象定位的挑战，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

TL;DR: DCDM通过双约束控制器优化预训练扩散模型，有效减少超低剂量PET重建的可训练参数，提升重建灵活性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建在减少患者辐射暴露和缩短检查时间方面具有潜力，但可能导致噪声增加和图像细节减少，影响图像质量。

Method: 提出了一种双约束扩散模型（DCDM），通过冻结预训练扩散模型的权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，显著减少了可训练参数数量。具体包括核变换器约束（NTC）和编码连接约束（ENC）两个模块。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知和未知DRF场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCDM在已知和未知剂量减少因子（DRF）场景下均优于现有方法，即使在超低剂量水平（如全剂量的1%）下也表现出色。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

Conclusion: 本文提出的DAOVI方法通过考虑测地线距离和时间运动信息，以及深度感知特征传播模块，有效解决了全向视频修复中的几何失真问题，实验结果表明其性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在推理过程中存在效率低下的问题，尤其是处理长序列时延迟高，LightVLM旨在通过训练无关的方法解决这一问题。

Method: LightVLM 将VLM的推理过程分为编码和解码两个阶段，分别采用金字塔令牌合并和KV Cache压缩技术加速。

Result: 实验表明，LightVLM在仅保留35%图像令牌时性能无损，3%时仍保持98%性能；网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍，长序列推理时间减少3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM 是一种无需训练即可显著加速现有视觉语言模型（VLM）推理的方法，通过分层编码和KV Cache压缩，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an

TL;DR: SA-LDL算法通过阶段自适应建模和加权损失，显著提升了年龄估计的准确性，在MORPH-II和FG-NET上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多通过相邻年龄组的相关性建模处理标签歧义，但忽略了不同年龄阶段歧义程度的差异。

Method: 提出了阶段自适应标签分布学习（SA-LDL）算法，结合阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数，以处理不同年龄阶段的标签歧义。

Result: 在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上，SA-LDL分别取得了1.74和2.15的MAE，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SA-LDL算法通过阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数，有效捕捉了标签歧义的复杂结构，显著提升了年龄估计的准确性和鲁棒性。在MORPH-II和FG-NET数据集上分别取得了1.74和2.15的MAE，表现优异。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于学习的可变形图像配准中计算复杂度高和大变形处理的挑战。

Method: 提出Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR)框架，使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取和流估计，构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，逐步组合大变形模型下的微分同胚变形。

Result: 在五个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上，EOIR表现出色，实现了更高的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡。

Conclusion: EOIR框架通过分离特征学习和流估计，实现了更好的精度-效率和精度-平滑度权衡，且在多种数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench 是首个全面覆盖视频理解核心方面的基准，通过大规模数据集和多样化的模型评估，揭示了现有 MRMs 的局限性，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频领域多模态奖励模型评估基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评估维度不全面以及对不同类型 MRMs 评估不足的问题。

Method: 通过 AI 辅助的数据流水线，构建了一个高质量偏好数据集，包含 1,563 个标注样本，覆盖视频理解的四个核心方面：感知、知识、推理和安全性。

Result: 评估了 28 个多模态奖励模型，结果显示即使表现最佳的 GPT-4o 模型总体准确率仅为 57.0%，开源模型 Qwen2.5-VL-72B 仅为 53.3%。分析还揭示了三个关键发现。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench 提供了一个具有挑战性和价值的基准，用于推进视频领域中多模态奖励模型的评估和开发。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频数据在复杂场景中的爆炸性增长，快速检索群体活动成为紧迫问题。现有方法往往只能检索整个视频，而非活动粒度。

Method: 提出了STVH（时空交错视频哈希）技术，通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉时空演化特征。进一步提出M-STVH（多焦点时空视频哈希）作为增强版本，通过多焦点表示学习实现分层特征集成。

Result: 在公开数据集上的比较实验表明，STVH和M-STVH均能取得优异结果。

Conclusion: STVH和M-STVH技术在公开数据集上均取得了优异的结果，证明了其在视频检索任务中的有效性。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

TL;DR: TRUST通过双流框架和Token-dRiven模块优化超声波图像风格迁移，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同设备采集的超声波图像风格差异导致下游任务性能下降，现有UI2I方法未明确过滤最相关的风格特征，可能导致翻译图像与下游任务需求不匹配。

Method: 提出TRUST框架，包含Token-dRiven模块和双流设计，通过数据视图和模型视图选择最优目标风格，并引入行为镜像损失和辅助提示匹配内容表示。

Result: 在超声波数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能上均优于现有UI2I方法。

Conclusion: TRUST框架通过双流设计和Token-dRiven模块，有效解决了超声波图像风格迁移中的内容与风格混淆问题，显著提升了视觉质量和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIaaS的普及使得通过API访问预训练模型成为可能，但黑盒模型的限制（如不暴露权重、训练数据或逻辑）使得当前领域适应方法不适用。论文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为ATGC的方法，利用DINOv2注意力图动态选择最优尺度进行黑盒模型推断，并通过熵评分注意力图来识别信息丰富的尺度以进行伪标签生成。

Result: 实验表明，ATGC方法在仅需one-hot API预测的情况下，在多个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入ATGC方法，成功解决了在黑盒模型限制下本地模型有效训练的问题，显著提升了蒸馏效果。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

Motivation: 解决Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation（CISS）中的原型特征纠缠和背景增量纠缠问题。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的类语义先验，通过语言引导的原型解缠和流形互背景解缠，自主解缠特征。

Result: 在Pascal VOC和ADE20k上实现了最先进的性能，尤其是在多步场景中。

Conclusion: 通过引入语言启发的框架（LBD），成功解决了CISS中的语义纠缠问题，并在Pascal VOC和ADE20k上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

Conclusion: BrainFM作为一种模态无关的多任务视觉基础模型，通过其创新的训练策略，成功提升了在多种脑成像任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，适用于多样化的临床协议。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细粒度目标检测中，尤其是在上下文依赖的场景（如车辆损伤评估）中，现有方法（如DiffusionDet）的性能受限于局部特征条件化。因此，需要一种能够整合全局场景上下文的方法来提升检测性能。

Method: CAF框架利用跨注意力机制，通过一个独立的编码器生成全局场景上下文，并将其与局部提案特征直接融合。这种方法使每个对象提案能够关注到全面的环境信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，CAF框架在CarDD基准测试上优于现有最先进模型，为细粒度领域中的上下文感知目标检测设定了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)框架通过结合全局场景上下文和局部提案特征，显著提升了细粒度目标检测的性能，特别是在车辆损伤评估等具有挑战性的视觉领域中。

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架通过解耦视觉和文本输入，在局部语义和全局上下文层面实现了视觉-语言对齐，支持开放词汇语义分割（OVSS）和参考表达分割（RES），为遥感图像分割提供了准确且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Method: 提出了一种新颖的方法，直接使用未经正射校正的数据（UnorthoDOS）进行训练，避免了传统预处理步骤。

Result: 机器学习模型在未经正射校正的数据上表现良好，且优于传统匹配滤波器方法。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在未经正射校正的数据（UnorthoDOS）上表现与正射校正数据相当，且在某些情况下优于传统匹配滤波器方法（mag1c）。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets

Motivation: 现有的基于注意力机制的Transformer在多视角3D人体姿态估计中难以准确建模关键点的空间排列，尤其是在遮挡场景下，且容易对训练数据中的特定相机配置和视觉场景过拟合。

Conclusion: MV-SSM框架通过引入多视图状态空间建模和GTBS扫描方法，显著提升了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化能力，并在多个数据集上取得了优于现有方法的表现。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

TL;DR: FtZ框架通过组合异构视觉编码器，显著提升了MLLMs在细粒度视觉任务上的表现，为下一代AI系统设计提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基本视觉任务上表现欠佳，主要原因是现有架构依赖单一视觉编码器，牺牲了捕获细粒度视觉信息的能力。

Method: 我们引入了Fusion to Enhance (FtZ)，一种新颖的视觉塔框架，通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制，创新性地将语义强大的锚定编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器组合起来。

Result: 实验结果表明，在多个需要细粒度视觉理解的挑战性基准测试中，如TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线模型。

Conclusion: 本工作证明，组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效路径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出STM策略，通过PEFT VFMs实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，仅需少量高可见度数据。实验证明STM优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计由于缺乏可靠的ground truth和从无标签真实数据中学习的困难而极具挑战性。现有方法通常依赖于带有伪标签的合成恶劣数据（存在领域差距）或自监督学习（在恶劣场景中违反光度假设）。

Method: 论文引入了选择-调整-维护（STM）策略，该策略基于两种有效秩（熵-秩和稳定-秩）对VFMs的预训练权重进行结构化分解。在调整阶段，根据熵-秩和全调整权重自适应选择适当的秩数和任务感知奇异方向进行初始化；在维护阶段，基于稳定-秩实施主方向正则化。

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试上的广泛实验表明，STM不仅优于现有的PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用合成恶劣数据训练的方法，甚至超越了深度基础模型。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为STM的策略，通过参数高效微调（PEFT）视觉基础模型（VFMs），仅使用少量高可见度数据实现了恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计。实验证明，STM不仅优于现有的PEFT方法和全微调，还超越了使用合成恶劣数据训练的方法，甚至超越了深度基础模型。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

Motivation: 挑战传统批评模型与策略模型分离的惯例，探索批评模型直接用于策略的可能性。

Method: 将偏好标记的批评数据集重组为可验证的训练信号，并直接在基础生成模型上进行强化学习，产生了LLaVA-Critic-R1。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1不仅在批评任务中表现出色，还作为策略模型在26个视觉推理和理解基准中匹配或超越专门训练的VLM，平均提升+5.7%。LLaVA-Critic-R1+进一步提升了策略性能，达到了7B规模的SoTA性能71.9。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，通过RL训练批评数据可以产生一个在评估和生成两方面都表现优异的统一模型，为可扩展、自我改进的多模态系统提供了一条简单路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模空间-光谱特征的远程依赖时存在二次计算复杂度问题，Mamba虽能降低计算负担但无法直接进行特征融合，因此需要探索其在多模态特征融合中的潜力。

Method: 首先为Mamba结构设计了遥感图像信息的预处理模块，并结合CNN提取多层特征；其次创新性地设计了基于Mamba算子的跨状态模块，充分融合两种模态的特征。

Result: 在MUUFL和Houston2018两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在减少网络训练负担的前提下，性能优于Transformer。

Conclusion: 论文提出的CSFMamba网络通过结合Mamba的低计算负担和CNN的多层特征提取能力，成功提升了遥感图像分类的性能，并在两个数据集上超越了Transformer的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管投影层在VLM架构中至关重要，但其对未见视觉概念的泛化能力尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 通过调整目标检测数据集（具有丰富的细粒度注释）到提示格式，并设计具有不相交标签集的训练/测试分割，实现了对未见和已见概念分离的精确控制。

Result: 实验结果表明，投影层在未见类别上保留了约79%至88%的性能（相对于已见类别），表明即使没有对这些概念的显式对齐监督，也存在非平凡的泛化水平。

Conclusion: 本研究引入了一个新的评估框架来衡量对齐泛化能力，并展示了在有限对齐数据下高效训练VLM的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种针对皮肤病变分类的公平性算法，通过减少与肤色相关的通道，专注于病变区域，从而降低计算成本并减少偏见，同时保持公平性，更具实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过因果分析更准确地解释视觉SAE特征，避免仅依赖激活位置导致的误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解稀疏自编码器(SAE)特征在视觉Transformer中的真实表示，传统方法通过检查特征激活最高的补丁，但自注意力机制混合了整个图像的信息，导致激活补丁可能并非真正驱动特征激活的原因。

Method: 提出Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE)，利用Effective Receptive Field (ERF)和输入归因方法，识别图像中真正驱动特征激活的补丁。

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF图与朴素激活图经常不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系（如"咆哮面部"特征需要眼睛和鼻子的共现）。补丁插入测试证实CaFE能更有效地恢复或抑制特征激活。

Conclusion: CaFE方法通过因果特征解释，提供了对视觉SAE特征更忠实和语义精确的解释，揭示了仅依赖激活位置可能导致误解的风险。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Motivation: 传统视觉-语言检索方法在处理抽象事件、隐含因果关系、时间上下文或长复杂叙述时表现不佳，因此需要一种新方法来理解潜在事件语义、上下文和现实世界知识。

Method: 采用多阶段检索框架，结合Qwen3进行文章搜索、Qwen3-Reranker进行上下文对齐、Qwen2-VL进行精确图像评分，并使用Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)融合多配置输出。

Result: 系统在EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge的Track 2私有测试集上取得了top-1成绩，证明了结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的多阶段检索框架结合了密集文章检索、事件感知语言模型重排序、高效图像收集以及标题引导的语义匹配和排名感知选择，有效解决了基于事件的图像检索挑战。

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand

reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the

Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现了HOI检测中的‘毒性兄弟’偏差问题，即相似但不相同的HOI三元组在输入和输出端互相干扰，导致精度下降。这一偏差源于兄弟类别之间的高度混淆。

Method: 研究采用了两种方法：1）‘对比后校准’：通过采样类似但不正确的HOI三元组并将其重建为正确的三元组；2）‘合并后拆分’：先学习兄弟类别的共享特征以区分其他组，再细化组内差异以保留独特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在HICO-Det数据集上比基线提升了9.18% mAP，比现有最佳方法提升了3.59% mAP。

Conclusion: 本研究通过提出两种新颖的去偏学习目标（‘对比后校准’和‘合并后拆分’），有效解决了HOI检测中的‘毒性兄弟’偏差问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

TL;DR: 提出Cancelable Product Quantization框架，通过分层两阶段设计（快速过滤+密文精确检索），在保证效率的同时解决面部检索的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代面部检索系统的检索阶段常外包给第三方，存在用户肖像隐私风险。尽管同态加密（HE）提供强大安全性，但其计算效率低下，不适合实时应用。

Method: 提出了一个分层的两阶段框架，包括：(i) 高吞吐量的可取消PQ索引模块用于快速候选过滤，(ii) 细粒度的密文空间检索模块用于最终精确的面部排名。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在有效性、效率和安全性之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: Cancelable Product Quantization框架在保证效率的同时，有效平衡了面部检索的有效性、效率和安全性。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs）和交叉注意力机制的新型图像到脑信号框架，成功生成了具有生物合理性的脑信号，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要关注静态场景理解，忽视了真实驾驶场景中至关重要的时间维度。

Method: 提出了OmniReason-Data数据集和OmniReason-Agent架构，前者通过自动标注管道生成时空密集标注和自然语言解释，后者结合稀疏时间记忆模块和解释生成器，通过时空知识蒸馏捕获时空因果推理模式。

Result: OmniReason-Agent在开放环规划和VQA基准测试中表现优异，为复杂动态环境中的自动驾驶提供了可解释的、时间感知的新能力。

Conclusion: OmniReason框架通过联合建模动态3D环境及其决策过程，显著提升了自动驾驶中的时空推理能力，并在开放环规划和VQA任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

Motivation: 传统单次检索增强生成（RAG）框架在知识密集型视觉问答中知识获取不足，限制了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的性能。

Method: MI-RAG 采用多模态迭代 RAG 框架，利用累积推理记录动态生成多查询，跨异构知识库联合搜索，并逐步合成新知识以优化推理。

Result: 在 Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek 和 OK-VQA 等基准测试中，MI-RAG 显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确性。

Conclusion: MI-RAG 提出了一种多模态迭代 RAG 框架，通过动态多查询和跨模态知识合成，显著提升了知识密集型视觉问答任务的检索召回率和答案准确性。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Motivation: 水下环境中的3D重建面临光失真、浑浊和能见度低等挑战，现有AI方法尚未充分发挥潜力，尤其是在语言模型与视觉处理的结合方面。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的多模态跨知识框架，通过将额外语义特征嵌入高斯基元并结合CLIP提取的语义特征进行监督，实现了语义和结构感知的训练。此外，还设计了阶段式训练策略，结合粗到细学习和后期参数细化，进一步提升了重建质量。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过语义引导的3D高斯溅射和阶段式训练策略，显著提升了水下3D重建的精度和稳定性，为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种即插即用的自适应对比度调整模块（ACAM），有效提高了胎儿超声标准平面分类的准确性和鲁棒性，为医学图像分析在真实图像质量变化下的应用提供了新范例。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估计算机视觉模型的鲁棒性，需要高效的对抗攻击方法。

Method: 提出了基于梯度的攻击方法Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM)，建立了一个'cycle-stage-step'的三层优化框架，并在不同阶段使用不同的损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，SDM相比之前的SOTA方法具有更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益。

Conclusion: SDM不仅展现出更强的攻击性能，还能与对抗训练方法结合以提升防御效果。

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Conclusion: 该论文通过结合Gabor滤波器和模糊U-Net-ViT模型，提出了一种新颖的方法，显著提高了纹理表面缺陷检测的准确性和可靠性。通过参数优化和消融研究，验证了模型在多个数据集上的高性能表现。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的统一优化框架通过将相机姿态作为可学习参数与3D高斯属性结合进行端到端优化，显著提升了重建质量和姿态估计精度。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解单视图NVS为360度场景外推和视图插值，确保了长期视图和场景的一致性，并在用户定义的轨迹上生成连贯视图方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Method: FQAT方法包括：i) 引入层间冻结机制以缓解双优化目标（即传统QAT和平坦性）之间的梯度冲突；ii) 提出一种基于梯度无序度的自适应冻结算法，动态决定每步训练中冻结哪些层，并设计梯度无序度指标来识别训练中的不稳定层。

Result: 在多个有影响力的OOD基准测试上的实验表明，FQAT在I.D和OOD图像分类任务中均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前量化感知训练（QAT）方法主要关注提升量化模型在分布内（I.D）数据上的性能，而忽视了在分布外（OOD）数据上可能出现的性能下降问题。本文通过实验验证了QAT会导致OOD泛化性能显著下降，并提出了一种面向平坦性的QAT方法（FQAT），通过层间冻结机制和自适应冻结算法，有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI筛查方法依赖轮廓数据，忽视临床相关的不对称性；而姿态数据虽直观但缺乏大规模标注数据集且对噪声敏感。

Method: 提出了双表示框架（DRF），结合连续骨架图和离散PAV，并引入PAV引导注意力模块（PGA）指导特征提取。

Result: DRF在实验中表现优异，可视化证实模型能有效利用临床不对称线索指导特征提取。

Conclusion: DRF框架通过结合连续骨架图和离散PAV，成功提升了脊柱侧弯筛查的性能，并公开了数据集和代码以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一种轻量级token选择框架，通过优化视觉token选择和引入语义记忆库，显著提升了提示调优的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的成功展示了提示调优在跨模态语义对齐任务中的潜力，但冗余或弱相关特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本。因此，需要一种既能提升准确性又能提高效率的方法。

Method: Spotlighter是一个轻量级的token选择框架，通过样本和语义两个角度评估视觉token的激活，并保留高分token进行下游预测。此外，使用类特定语义记忆库和学习原型来优化选择，并引入两级排名机制动态加权token与原型交互。

Result: 在11个few-shot基准测试中，Spotlighter比CLIP在谐波平均准确率上提高了11.19%，并实现了额外的0.8K FPS，仅增加了21个参数。

Conclusion: Spotlighter被证明是一种高效且可扩展的提示调优基线方法，在11个few-shot基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

Motivation: 对抗性补丁对AI模型的鲁棒性构成重大挑战，特别是在计算机视觉任务中。

Method: 提出了增量补丁生成（IPG）方法，通过实验和消融研究验证其效率，包括YOLO的特征分布可视化和对抗训练结果。

Result: IPG生成对抗性补丁的效率比现有方法高11.1倍，同时保持相当的攻击性能，并能覆盖更广泛的模型漏洞。

Conclusion: IPG方法在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用中具有巨大潜力，特别是在自动驾驶、安全系统和医学影像等领域。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

Conclusion: DarkVRAI在低光RAW视频去噪任务中表现出色，通过结合条件化方案和BOSS机制，实现了最先进的性能，为该领域设立了新标准。

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

Motivation: 现有令牌压缩策略采用固定压缩比，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的可变性，导致信息丰富片段表示不足或静态片段计算冗余。

Method: 提出了LangDC，一种基于轻量级语言模型的动态令牌压缩器，通过生成软字幕令牌作为视觉表示，并结合语义密度感知监督进行训练。

Result: 实验结果显示，与VideoGPT+相比，LangDC减少了49%的FLOPs，同时保持了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: LangDC通过动态调整压缩比，有效减少了计算量（FLOPs降低49%），同时保持了竞争性性能，并能够根据视频片段的语义密度自适应调整压缩比例。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

Motivation: 研究如何在3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）框架中整合RGB和多光谱图像，解决光谱域中几何结构不一致的问题。

Method: 评估了三种策略：1) 无共享结构的单独每带重建；2) 拆分优化，先优化RGB几何结构，复制后拟合新带；3) 联合优化，可选初始RGB阶段。

Result: 通过定量指标和定性新视角渲染展示了联合优化策略的有效性，提升了多光谱重建质量并通过光谱串扰增强了RGB结果。

Conclusion: 建议将多光谱数据直接整合到球谐颜色组件中，以紧凑地建模每个高斯的多光谱反射率。分析揭示了在优化过程中引入光谱带的关键权衡，为稳健的多模态3DGS重建提供了实用见解。

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Motivation: 理解经验丰富的驾驶员在雨天条件下的视觉适应行为，对于设计稳健的驾驶员监控系统（DMS）和高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）至关重要。

Method: 采用两步聚类方法：首先在10秒间隔内对注视点进行聚类，然后将聚类中心点聚合成元聚类。结合马尔可夫转移矩阵、注视持续时间、视线高度和方位分布等指标进行分析。

Result: 雨天条件下，驾驶员的注视行为表现为更频繁的仪表盘扫视、更长的注视持续时间和更高的视线高度，表明认知专注增加。

Conclusion: 雨天条件下，驾驶员表现出更高的认知专注，表现为更频繁的仪表盘扫视、更长的注视持续时间和更高的视线高度。这些发现为设计更稳健的ADAS和DMS提供了有价值的视觉注意力模式洞察。

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Conclusion: CompSlider通过在条件先验的潜在空间中操作，无需重新训练基础模型，显著降低了计算负担，并在图像和视频生成中展示了其通用性。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法在定量和定性上均优于现有技术，特别是在处理未见过的污染类型时表现优异。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Conclusion: SpectMamba通过结合HSFA块和VSSM模块，在医学图像检测任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

Motivation: 解决事件相机在极端光照变化下视觉地点识别的鲁棒性问题，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 采用集成方法，结合多种事件到帧重建、VPR特征提取器和时间分辨率，扩展了传统仅利用时间分辨率的集成策略。

Result: 在日夜间转换场景中Recall@1相对提升57%，并在两个长期驾驶数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过提出一种基于事件相机的集成方法，结合多种重建、特征提取和时间分辨率，显著提升了在极端光照条件下的视觉地点识别（VPR）性能。

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

TL;DR: BSA框架通过动态稀疏化查询和键值对，高效提升视频DiT模型的训练和推理速度，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer（DiT）模型在生成高质量视频时面临计算瓶颈，全注意力的二次复杂度导致训练和推理成本过高。

Method: 提出双向稀疏注意力（BSA）框架，通过语义相似性和动态空间-时间训练策略优化查询稀疏性，并通过统计动态阈值保留最显著的键值块以实现KV稀疏性。

Result: BSA在长序列训练中显著加速DiT，减少FLOPs高达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，且生成质量不降反升。

Conclusion: BSA框架通过动态稀疏化查询和键值对，显著提升了视频DiT模型的训练和推理效率，同时保持或超越了全注意力的生成质量。

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

Motivation: 解决现有两阶段方法无法全局优化时空上下文、依赖复杂后处理导致推理效率低的问题。

Method: VEPE框架包含三个关键时空Transformer组件：时空姿态编码器（STPE）、时空可变形记忆编码器（STDME）和时空姿态解码器（STPD），并结合实例一致性机制优化跨帧姿态查询匹配。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上，VEPE性能优于多数两阶段模型，推理效率提升300%。

Conclusion: VEPE框架通过创新的时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，显著提升了视频中人体姿态估计的准确性和推理效率。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Motivation: 现有方法通常顺序处理全局和局部信息且缺乏交互，导致重建点云质量受限。

Result: 在基准数据集上，PVINet表现出与最先进方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行捕获全局结构特征和局部上下文特征，并在各尺度进行交互，显著提升了点云压缩的重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决退化场景下布局到图像生成中的‘上下文幻觉困境’，即前景实例被上下文主导的频率分布所淹没的问题。

Method: FICGen包含两个主要步骤：1）通过可学习的双查询机制和频率重采样器从训练集中提取上下文频率原型；2）使用视觉频率增强注意力将频率原型注入退化生成过程，并结合实例一致性图和自适应空间-频率聚合模块。

Result: 在5个基准测试中，FICGen在生成保真度、对齐性和下游辅助可训练性方面均优于现有L2I方法。

Conclusion: FICGen通过频率启发的上下文解耦生成范式，显著提升了在退化场景下的布局到图像生成的保真度和对齐能力，并在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken是一种基于2D高斯参数化的非均匀图像标记化框架，通过动态建模区域形状、位置和纹理，显著提升了图像表示和生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法受限于均匀的2D/1D网格标记化，无法灵活表示不同形状、纹理和位置的区域，限制了特征表示的效果。

Method: 首先使用熵驱动算法将图像分割为纹理均匀的区域，然后每个区域参数化为一个2D高斯（均值表示位置，协方差表示形状）和纹理特征。通过专门训练的Transformer优化高斯参数，实现位置/形状的连续适应和内容感知特征提取。解码时，通过可微分的基于splatting的渲染器将高斯参数化标记重构为2D特征图。

Result: GPSToken在128个标记的情况下，图像重建和生成任务的rFID和FID分数分别为0.65和1.50，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GPSToken通过动态建模图像区域的位置、形状和纹理，实现了非均匀的图像标记化，显著提升了图像表示和生成的性能。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSSL是一种基于空间异质性损失的半监督学习框架，通过自适应权重分配和噪声处理，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法（如Mean Teacher、FixMatch、CPS）主要关注一致性正则化或伪标签监督，但忽视了标注数据中的潜在噪声和未标注像素的异质性。作者认为，有效挖掘损失函数中两个预测的丰富信息比获取参考预测的具体策略更为重要。

Method: 提出了一种基于空间异质性损失的通用框架MetaSSL，通过同时利用参考预测和监督预测之间的不确定性和一致性信息，为不同像素分配不同权重。具体包括将未标注数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），并提出自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，MetaSSL与现有半监督学习框架结合后，在不同数据集上显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: MetaSSL通过引入空间异质性损失函数，有效提升了半监督学习在医学图像分割中的性能，尤其在处理标注噪声和未标注像素异质性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Conclusion: MVTrajecter通过引入轨迹运动成本和轨迹外观成本，有效利用了多时间戳信息，提高了多视角行人跟踪的鲁棒性，并在实验中超越了现有最优方法。

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 通过实证分析，评估了当前流行的视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面的能力。

Result: 实证证据显示，流行的视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，现有的视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面存在局限性，可能需要开发更有效的关键帧识别技术以提升视频MLLMs的效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解决动态一致性和复杂语义上下文方面存在不足，主要受限于EEG的低空间分辨率、神经记录与视频动态之间的时间不匹配以及脑活动中语义信息的利用不足。

Method: DynaMind框架包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器（RSM）、时间感知动态对齐器（TDA）和双引导视频重建器（DGVR），分别负责提取多模态语义特征、生成动态潜在序列以及翻译成高保真视频重建。

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上，DynaMind实现了视频和帧级别的重建准确率分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，像素级质量显著提升（SSIM提高9.4%，FVMD减少19.7%），达到了新的SOTA水平。

Conclusion: DynaMind通过联合建模神经动力学和语义特征，显著提升了从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的准确性和视觉保真度，标志着神经动力学与高保真视觉语义之间的重要进步。

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Conclusion: FocusDPO框架通过动态调整焦点区域和建立语义对应映射，显著提升了多主体个性化图像生成的性能，在保持主体保真度的同时有效减少了属性泄漏。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM范式实现了全面、像素级的SQA，并在32个数据集上展示了最先进的性能和卓越的零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal

canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which

Motivation: 解决现有方法仅从单一形状学习规范嵌入的局限性，提升多形状匹配的鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: DcMatch通过引入形状图注意力网络和双重一致性损失，显著提升了多形状匹配的准确性和一致性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework with dynamic low-rank experts improves monocular depth estimation in endoscopy, addressing illumination and feature variety, and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variety of illumination conditions and scene features in endoscopic scenes poses a challenge for generalizable depth estimation, necessitating a robust self-supervised approach.

Method: A self-supervised framework with a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed for efficient finetuning of the foundation model. Additionally, a self-supervised training framework addresses brightness and reflectance inconsistency.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art works on realistic and simulated datasets and achieves the best generalization in zero-shot depth estimation on diverse endoscopic scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method contributes to accurate endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery, outperforming state-of-the-art works on both realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

Result: 实验表明，新数据预训练能有效提升开放词汇SGG模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的无参考指标和高质量合成数据生成方法，显著提升了开放词汇场景图生成模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Conclusion: 本文提出的两阶段框架成功构建了高质量的文档提取数据集和模型，POINTS-Reader在性能上超越了现有公开和专有模型。

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Conclusion: FantasyHSI通过引入动态有向图和多智能体协作系统，结合闭环反馈机制和DPO训练，显著提升了人类-场景交互的泛化能力、长时任务完成度和物理真实性。

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Conclusion: Point-PQAE通过跨重建生成范式显著提升了3D自监督学习的性能，超越了传统的单模态自重建方法。

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard

components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个联合LiDAR超分辨率与语义分割的端到端框架，通过轻量级模型和优化策略，使低成本传感器性能接近高成本方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低成本传感器（如16通道LiDAR）产生的稀疏点云导致语义分割精度下降的问题，同时降低高分辨率传感器的高成本限制。

Method: 采用端到端框架，结合联合优化训练，设计了新的超分辨率损失函数，并采用轻量级模型架构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在分割性能上接近使用高分辨率64通道LiDAR数据的模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的联合优化框架成功地将LiDAR超分辨率与语义分割结合，显著提升了低成本传感器在3D语义分割中的表现，性能接近高成本64通道LiDAR数据。

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

TL;DR: PGRD是一种基于扩散的医学图像分割框架，通过先验指导和残差学习，提高了分割精度和校准性，同时减少了采样步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中存在模糊性，需要模型捕捉完整的条件分布而非单一点估计。

Method: PGRD采用扩散模型框架，将离散标签嵌入连续空间，通过先验预测器提供逐步指导，扩散网络学习残差以加速收敛。此外，采用深度扩散监督方案稳定训练。

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上，PGRD相比贝叶斯、集成、Probabilistic U-Net和普通扩散基线，表现更优，且需要更少的采样步骤。

Conclusion: PGRD框架通过结合先验指导和残差扩散，在医学图像分割中实现了更高的Dice分数和更低的NLL/ECE值，同时保持了高效的采样步骤。

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

quality of noisy images, especially those encountered in industrial
environments. [1, 2]. Our focus is on evaluating methods built on supervised

Method: 该方法整合了开放权重的多模态大语言模型与检索增强生成技术，使用SigLIP编码器在两个大规模数据集（EMP-16和OSV-5M）上构建向量数据库，并通过检索相似和不同的地理位置信息来增强查询图像。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于检索增强生成的多模态大语言模型方法，用于街景图像的地理定位，避免了昂贵的微调或重新训练需求，并在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3Ret通过统一视觉编码器和自监督学习，在混合模态医学图像检索中实现了零样本和跨模态的卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法因针对2D、3D和视频数据分别设计架构和训练策略而碎片化，这种模态特定设计阻碍了统一表示的发展。

Method: 利用包含867,653个医学成像样本的大规模混合模态数据集，训练M3Ret，一个无需任何模态特定定制的统一视觉编码器，结合生成式（MAE）和对比式（SimDINO）自监督学习范式。

Result: M3Ret在所有单独模态的零样本图像到图像检索中实现了新的最先进性能，超越了DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等强基线。在没有配对数据的情况下出现了强跨模态对齐，且模型推广到未见过的MRI任务。

Conclusion: M3Ret作为视觉自监督学习在多模态医学图像理解中的基础模型迈出了一步，为医学成像社区提供了一个有前景的信号。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Motivation: 解决数据稀缺和高调优成本对身份保持文本到视频（IPT2V）生成技术进一步发展的限制。

Method: 提出了训练自由的提示、图像和引导增强（TPIGE）框架，包括Face Aware Prompt Enhancement、Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement和ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement三个关键步骤。

Result: 在1000个视频测试集上通过自动和人工评估验证了方法的优越性，超越了先前的工作。

Conclusion: TPIGE框架在保持身份一致性和视频质量方面表现出色，赢得了ACM Multimedia 2025挑战赛的第一名，展示了其先进性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Conclusion: Uirapuru框架通过结合摄像头驱动的全面理解和快速自适应分块技术，显著提升了高分辨率可转向摄像头实时视频分析的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust

Motivation: PRVR中存在的查询模糊性和部分视频相关性导致跨模态对齐困难，现有方法易受干扰视频影响。

Method: RAL框架采用多元高斯分布编码视频和查询，并引入可学习的置信门动态加权相似性。

Result: RAL框架在多种检索骨干网络上表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: RAL框架通过概率建模和动态加权相似性，有效解决了PRVR中的数据不确定性，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 体素网格在医学影像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，而隐式3D表示能更有效地处理稀疏和噪声数据。

Method: 利用神经占用场预测3D点是否位于物体内部或外部来表示CT扫描的肋骨，并应用拉普拉斯基收缩提取肋骨的中轴。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上评估了该方法，证明了其在稀疏信号补偿和几何操作中的有效性。

Conclusion: RibPull方法通过隐式占用场成功结合了计算几何与医学影像，展示了连续坐标基础3D场景表示在稀疏数据处理和几何操作中的优势。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像编辑中主要关注语义控制，而忽视了风格一致性的重要性，这影响了图像的连贯性和美观性。

Method: NSD采用扩散模型，结合并行交叉注意力机制处理文本和风格信息，并引入PSRL模块通过风格对比损失学习细粒度风格表示。

Result: 实验表明NSD在保持风格一致性和语义控制方面优于现有方法，并通过综合基准验证了其性能。

Conclusion: NSD框架通过结合先进的扩散模型和PSRL模块，成功实现了在图像编辑和修复中保持语义控制和风格一致性的双重目标，并通过建立的综合基准验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出MILO是为了解决现有图像质量评估指标在准确性和效率上的不足，同时探索其在生成模型中的潜在应用。

Method: MILO通过伪MOS监督训练，利用可重复的失真和多样化的图像，结合视觉掩蔽效应的质量指标进行评分，无需大规模人工标注数据集。其紧凑架构适合实时应用。

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中优于现有指标，并在生成任务中通过空间掩蔽和课程学习策略显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: MILO不仅是一个先进的图像质量评估指标，还能作为生成管道中感知优化的实用工具，显著提升去噪、超分辨率和面部修复等任务的性能。

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Conclusion: InfoScale框架通过渐进频率补偿、自适应信息聚合和噪声适应模块，有效解决了扩散模型在变尺度图像生成中的信息丢失、聚合不灵活和分布不对齐问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Method: 提出 Mamba-CNN，一种轻量级的 Mamba 启发的状态空间模型（SSM）门控机制，集成到分层卷积主干中，动态调制特征图并选择性强调显著面部特征及其长程空间关系。

Result: 在 SCUT-FBP5500 基准测试中，Mamba-CNN 实现了 Pearson 相关系数（PC）0.9187、平均绝对误差（MAE）0.2022 和均方根误差（RMSE）0.2610，创下新记录。

Conclusion: Mamba-CNN 结合 CNN 和选择性 SSM，展示了在视觉理解任务中的协同潜力，为复杂的视觉任务提供了新的架构范式。

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Method: 提出了一个自适应的卷积模块，动态调整卷积核大小，集成到MSConvBridge和MSADecoder中，以优化特征提取。

Result: 在Synapse、ACDC、Kvasir和ISIC2017数据集上分别达到了86.49%、92.56%、93.37%和92.98%的Dice系数。

Conclusion: MSA2-Net通过自适应的卷积模块显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性和泛化能力，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent

find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Motivation: 尽管通用视觉语言模型（VLMs）在放射学中展现出潜力，但在高风险的诊断放射学领域，这些模型往往缺乏可靠的临床使用所需的判别精度，且公开的体积CT数据集稀缺且异质性高，标注格式和粒度差异大。

Method: Uniferum是一种体积VLM，通过统一分类标签和分割掩码等多样监督信号到一个训练框架中，并协调三个公开的3D CT数据集进行训练。

Result: Uniferum在CT-RATE基准测试中AUROC提升了7%，优于基于CLIP和传统的多标签卷积模型，并在RAD-CHEST和INSPECT数据集上表现出意外的零样本性能。

Conclusion: Uniferum通过整合异构注释和身体分割，显著提升了模型性能，为3D医学影像中临床可靠、数据高效的多模态视觉语言模型（VLM）设定了新方向。

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

TL;DR: PointSlice 通过将 3D 点云切片为 2D 数据并引入 SIN 网络，实现了高精度和快速推理，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 voxel-based 方法精度高但推理速度慢，而 pillar-based 方法速度快但精度不足。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了 PointSlice 方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的点云处理方法 PointSlice，将 3D 点云转换为多组 2D 数据切片，并引入了 Slice Interaction Network (SIN) 以保持切片间的垂直关系。

Result: 在 Waymo 数据集上，PointSlice 比 SAFDNet 快 1.13 倍，参数减少 0.79 倍，精度仅降低 1.2 mAPH；在 nuScenes 数据集上达到 66.74 mAP 的 state-of-the-art 结果；在 Argoverse 2 数据集上快 1.10 倍，参数减少 0.66 倍，精度降低 1.0 mAP。

Conclusion: PointSlice 方法在 Waymo、nuScenes 和 Argoverse 2 数据集上实现了高检测精度和推理速度，同时在参数数量和速度上优于现有的 voxel-based 方法。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高，且依赖于大型未压缩的U-Net或扩散变换器骨干网络，限制了其在非数据中心GPU上的应用。现有的后训练量化方法也依赖于全精度校准，进一步增加了计算负担。

Conclusion: Q-Sched通过调整扩散模型的调度器而非模型权重，实现了模型尺寸的4倍缩减，同时保持全精度准确率。JAQ损失的引入进一步优化了量化感知的预条件系数，无需全精度推理校准。Q-Sched在FID指标和用户研究中均表现出显著优势，证明了量化与少步蒸馏在高保真生成中的互补性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

TL;DR: HIFU-ILDiff 是一种基于深度学习的实时超声图像去噪方法，显著提升HIFU治疗监测的精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HIFU治疗中实时超声监测因干扰受限的问题。

Method: HIFU-ILDiff 结合了VQ-VAE和潜在扩散模型，通过编码-去噪-解码流程重构高分辨率无干扰超声图像。

Result: HIFU-ILDiff 在SSIM和PSNR指标上显著优于传统Notch Filter方法，并能实现15帧/秒的实时处理速度。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff 是一种新型深度学习方法，能够有效抑制HIFU治疗中超声图像的干扰，显著提升实时监测的精度和速度，有望改善当前临床应用的精准度。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

TL;DR: Keye-VL-1.5通过Slow-Fast编码、渐进预训练和综合后训练，显著提升了视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解因动态和信息密集特性而具有挑战性，现有模型在空间分辨率和时间覆盖之间存在权衡问题。

Method: 1. 创新的Slow-Fast视频编码策略；2. 渐进式四阶段预训练方法；3. 全面的后训练流程，包括推理增强和人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: Keye-VL-1.5在视频理解任务中表现显著优于现有模型，同时在通用多模态基准测试中保持竞争力。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

Motivation: 现代深度学习发展为3D映射技术、场景重建流程和虚拟现实开发带来了新机遇，但直接训练深度学习模型面临高维度和标记数据集稀缺的挑战。传统方法在非结构化环境中表现不佳，需要开发结合几何技术与深度学习的新方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种结合传统几何技术与深度学习能力的方法，通过整合深度信息、表面法线和等变性等几何先验或约束来增强深度学习模型。

Result: 研究系统性地探讨了3D视觉的关键组件，并展示了其在数字文化遗产保护和沉浸式VR/AR环境等实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文通过开发几何深度学习方法来应对3D视觉中的基本挑战，如相机姿态估计、点云配准、深度预测和3D重建。结合几何先验或约束增强了几何表示的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM作为一种实时单目视觉SLAM系统，无需相机内参即可运行，适用于多样化的相机设置。其轻量级对称双视图关联（STA）模型显著降低了复杂度，同时提升了双视图约束的质量。后端设计的Sim(3)位姿图结合闭环检测，有效解决了累积漂移问题。实验表明，该系统在相机追踪和密集3D重建质量上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有的地理定位模型（如GeoCLIP）在准确性上有所提升，但其可解释性仍不足，且当前的概念解释方法未能有效与地理对齐的嵌入目标对齐。

Method: 通过插入一个概念感知对齐模块，将图像和位置嵌入共同投影到共享的地理概念库上，并最小化概念级损失，以增强概念特定子空间的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅超越了GeoCLIP的地理定位准确性，还在多样化的地理空间预测任务中提升了性能，并揭示了地理决策过程中更丰富的语义信息。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合概念瓶颈的全球地理定位新框架，显著提高了地理定位的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型（如CLIP）在自然图像与语言对齐方面表现出色，但在处理包含结构化、符号化信息的专门视觉领域（如图解）时存在局限性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的训练范式，通过使用‘困难’样本和两种专门设计的损失函数，利用图解的内在结构特性进行对比学习。

Result: 在流程图基准数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法在图像-文本匹配和视觉问答任务上显著优于标准CLIP和传统的硬负样本CLIP学习范式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了针对特定任务的定制化训练策略的重要性，并在视觉-语言整合的广泛领域中推动了图解理解的进步。

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖成本高的人工标注数据或质量有限的机器生成数据，自监督数据则易引入幻觉，因此需要一种更高效且可靠的对齐方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于协作学习的Panel-of-Peers框架，利用多模型互相评估和迭代自我改进来生成和优化输出。

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers学习框架通过模拟同行评审系统，显著提升了大型视觉与语言模型的性能，且无需依赖大量人工标注数据。

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个基于2D高斯泼溅的图像修复框架，通过连续渲染范式和预训练DINO模型的全局特征，实现了像素级一致性和语义一致性，为高斯泼溅在2D图像处理中的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Motivation: 解决多模态统一模型中理解模块与生成模块责任分配不平衡的问题，提升图像编辑的精确性。

Method: 提出DIM数据集，包含DIM-T2I和DIM-Edit两个子集，并设计了一个轻量级的两层MLP连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B。

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中表现优异，超越了更大的模型如UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit。

Conclusion: 通过明确将设计责任分配给理解模块，显著提升了图像编辑性能，证明了DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中的优越性。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at
https://github.com/showlab/DIM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过简化OpenVision的架构和损失设计，提升其训练效率，同时保持性能。

Method: 移除了文本编码器和对比损失，仅保留生成式训练的captioning loss，简化了OpenVision的架构。

Result: OpenVision 2在多项多模态基准测试中与原始模型性能相当，同时大幅减少了训练时间和内存消耗（训练时间减少1.5倍，内存使用减少1.8倍），并支持更大规模的参数扩展（超过10亿参数）。

Conclusion: OpenVision 2通过简化架构和损失设计，显著提升了训练效率，同时保持了与原始模型相当的性能，为未来多模态基础模型的视觉编码器开发提供了轻量级、纯生成的范例。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of

yet effective technique notably improves the discriminative power of learned
representations. Our experiments show performance improvements for both DeiT-S

perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Conclusion: 该论文探讨了合成数据在自监督学习中的潜力与局限，为未来研究方向提供了见解。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

Conclusion: PCA在多层光谱图像的多标签分类中的有效性高度依赖于所选的深度学习架构和训练策略。

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Motivation: 当前表面异常检测方法在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测上表现不佳，现有最佳方法依赖预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，结合新提出的组合分支显式建模对象组合图的分布，学习重要的语义关系，并引入无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组合图提取新流程。

Result: SALAD在MVTec LOCO基准测试中取得了96.1%的图像级AUROC，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SALAD显著提升了逻辑异常检测的性能，在MVTec LOCO基准测试中达到了96.1%的图像级AUROC。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Motivation: 有限角度CT在心脏成像中具有时间分辨率高和辐射剂量低的优势，但投影截断会导致严重伪影，因此需要一种新方法来改善重建质量。

Method: 提出了一种基于双阶段扩散的框架，第一阶段通过仅基于元数据的Transformer扩散模型生成粗略解剖先验，第二阶段结合元数据和粗略先验生成高保真图像，并在每个采样步骤中通过ADMM模块强制物理数据一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上的实验表明，结合元数据显著提升了重建保真度，尤其在严重角度截断情况下，性能优于现有无元数据基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合临床元数据的双阶段扩散框架显著提升了有限角度CT重建的质量和效率，支持未来在元数据引导的医学成像框架中的应用。

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLM）在空间关系理解上表现不佳，需要一个专门的基准测试来评估和改进这一能力。

Method: 通过构建全新的真实世界图像-文本对，主要涵盖相对空间理解和物体顺序，设计了一个对人类简单但对当前VLM困难的基准测试。

Result: 实验验证了基准测试的有效性，发现当前VLM在空间关系理解上表现较差，而推理模型表现较好。性能瓶颈主要在于空间推理而非物体定位能力。

Conclusion: 论文提出了RocketScience，一个开源的对齐VLM基准测试，用于测试空间关系理解能力。结果表明当前VLM在空间关系理解上存在显著不足，而推理模型表现优异。

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Conclusion: BIB和MBIB方法在长尾视觉识别任务中达到了最先进的性能，证明了其在保留关键标签相关信息方面的有效性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Motivation: 当前大多数方法通过训练大量特定领域数据集来解决图像光照控制问题，限制了基础模型的泛化能力和适用性。

Method: PractiLight通过训练一个轻量级LoRA回归器，利用少量训练图像生成直接辐照度图，并在生成过程中使用Classifier Guidance引入所需光照。

Result: PractiLight在质量和控制方面表现出色，与领先工作相比，在多种场景类型中证明了参数和数据效率。

Conclusion: 本文通过PractiLight方法，展示了利用基础生成模型知识可以有效控制图像光照，实现了实用且通用的重新光照。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Motivation: 当前基于单细胞RNA测序参考的模型存在数据丢失、依赖外部数据集和批次效应等问题。

Method: LGDiST是一种无参考的潜在基因扩散模型，利用上下文基因构建了丰富的生物遗传潜在空间。

Result: LGDiST在26个数据集上平均MSE降低了18%，并在六种最先进方法中提升了高达10%的预测性能。

Conclusion: LGDiST通过其完整的架构显著提升了性能，证明了其在基因表达补全中的有效性。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

*Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam,Mohammad Reza Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ORDAC方法，通过动态调整标签分布来纠正序数分类中的噪声标签，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记数据是训练监督深度学习模型的基础，但标记过程（尤其是序数图像分类中类别边界模糊的情况）容易出错和产生噪声。这种标签噪声会显著降低机器学习模型的性能和可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种名为ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC)的新型数据中心方法，利用标签分布学习(LDL)来建模序数标签中固有的模糊性和不确定性。在训练过程中，ORDAC动态调整每个样本的标签分布的均值和标准差，旨在纠正噪声标签并充分利用整个训练数据集。

Result: 在基准数据集（Adience和Diabetic Retinopathy）上评估了方法的有效性，结果显示ORDAC及其扩展版本（ORDAC_C和ORDAC_R）显著提高了模型性能。例如，在Adience数据集上，40%噪声情况下，ORDAC_R将平均绝对误差从0.86降低到0.62，召回率从0.37提高到0.49。

Conclusion: 自适应标签校正使用标签分布是一种有效策略，可以增强在存在噪声数据时序数分类模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Result: 在六个公开数据集上验证了GSD-Net的有效性，特别是在噪声标注下表现优异，如Kvasir数据集上提升2.52%。

Conclusion: GSD-Net通过整合几何和结构线索，显著提升了在噪声标注下的医学图像分割性能，并在多个公开数据集上实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

Method: 研究引入了两种基于预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本框架管道（Pipeline A和Pipeline B），并结合结构化提示进行多视角分析。

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets
lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While
single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture
dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the
Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,
interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

Conclusion: VARIN作为一种专为VAR模型设计的噪声反转编辑技术，通过LAI方法生成逆Gumbel噪声，有效实现了源图像的精确重建和基于文本提示的定向编辑，验证了其作为实用编辑方法的有效性。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous

explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major

Motivation: 调色板在创意工作流中广泛使用，但用于图像生成时存在模糊性和不稳定性，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: 通过将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，并引入两个标量控制参数（直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离）以及负直方图机制，实现了对颜色变化的灵活控制。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter方法在保持图像高质量的同时，显著提升了颜色调色板的忠实度，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Method: 本文提出了一种新颖、非侵入且自动化的视觉框架，包括嵌入式监测系统，使用量化MobileNet模型部署在Raspberry Pi上，用于实时行为状态检测。

Result: 系统在公共新生儿图像数据集上达到最先进准确率（睡眠检测91.8%，哭闹/正常分类97.7%），并保持适合边缘部署的计算效率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，轻量级优化模型（如MobileNet）为可扩展、低成本且具有临床可行性的NICU监测系统提供了最可行的基础，为资源受限环境中的早产儿护理改进铺平了道路。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: 该论文揭示了RMOT系统在设计和逻辑上的安全漏洞，提出了VEIL对抗框架，并证明了安全感知的RMOT设计在关键应用中的紧迫性。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了不同SOTA slot attention模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过在现有slot attention模型中引入ContextFusion阶段和Bootstrap Branch，显著提升了模型在模拟和真实数据集上的性能。

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Motivation: 当前的TTA基准未能真实反映现实场景中自然存在的时间依赖性，如视频流中连续帧可能显示同一对象。

Method: 通过从对象跟踪数据集的边界框编译对象中心图像的轨迹序列，构建了名为“固有时间依赖性”（ITD）的数据集，并进行全面的实验分析。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新型的对抗性记忆初始化策略，显著提升了多种方法在具有时间依赖性的挑战性基准上的性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying

the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and
spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid

(FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of
postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation
studies further confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: DSGC-Net通过双流图卷积网络有效解决了复杂人群场景中的密度分布差异和个体表示不一致问题，显著提升了计数精度。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

Motivation: 解决遥感图像中由于数据稀缺、复杂多尺度场景结构和显著分布偏移导致的OOD检测挑战。

Method: 提出了RS-OOD框架，包括空间特征增强、双提示对齐机制和置信度引导的自训练循环。

Result: RS-OOD在多个遥感基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并能够以最少标记数据实现高效适应。

Conclusion: RS-OOD框架通过空间语义整合，显著提升了少样本OOD检测的鲁棒性，并在多个遥感基准测试中优于现有方法，展示了其在遥感应用中的关键价值。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在空间关系任务上表现不佳，现有方法通过微调或手工设计的损失函数进行优化，但效果有限。本文旨在通过数据驱动的方式直接从模型内部表示中学习空间关系目标。

Method: 提出了 Learn-to-Steer 框架，通过训练一个轻量级分类器从扩散模型的交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，并将其作为学习的损失函数在推理时使用。采用双反转策略解决分类器可能依赖语言痕迹而非真实空间模式的问题。

Result: 在 FLUX.1-dev 和 SD2.1 基准测试中，空间关系准确性分别从 0.20 提升到 0.61 和从 0.07 提升到 0.54，方法在多个关系上表现出显著的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Learn-to-Steer 框架通过从扩散模型的内部表示中学习数据驱动的目标，显著提高了空间关系的准确性，并在多个关系和基准测试中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Conclusion: OmniActor成功利用GUI和具身数据的协同效应，消除了冲突，在GUI和具身任务中表现优于仅使用单一数据训练的代理。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对MLLMs空间理解能力的全面系统评估，且多局限于孤立场景。需要更系统地分析其局限性，以指导未来改进。

Method: 提出了一个名为MulSeT的基准测试，设计了三个代表性场景（单视图、多视图和视频）的实验，从数据和架构两个角度分析MLLMs的空间推理能力。

Result: 数据视角：空间理解的性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，上限较低，尤其是需要空间想象的任务。架构视角：空间理解更依赖视觉编码器中的位置编码，而非语言模型中的编码。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型在空间理解能力上存在局限性，仅通过扩大训练数据难以显著提升性能。未来的改进方向应结合数据扩展和架构优化，尤其是在视觉编码器中增强位置编码。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种实时高保真虚拟化妆试穿框架，通过解耦化妆转移步骤和专门训练目标，解决了现有方法在身份保持和时间一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在将半透明化妆品与肤色和其他身份特征分离时存在困难，导致身份偏移和公平性问题。此外，现有方法缺乏实时能力且无法保持时间一致性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 论文将化妆转移解耦为两个步骤：透明化妆掩模提取和基于图形的掩模渲染。化妆提取模型通过两种互补方法生成的伪地面真实数据进行训练：基于图形的渲染流程和无监督k-means聚类方法。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在捕捉细节、保持时间稳定性和维护身份完整性方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架在实时虚拟化妆试穿中实现了高保真、身份保持的化妆转移，并具有强大的时间一致性。通过解耦化妆转移为两个步骤，并通过专门的训练目标增强透明度和颜色保真度，该方法在多样化的姿势、表情和肤色中均表现出色。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

TL;DR: RiverScope是一个高分辨率数据集，显著提升了河流监测精度，支持气候适应和水资源管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测河流和地表水在精细空间和时间尺度上仍具有挑战性，尤其是对于窄或含沙量高的河流，这些河流难以被低分辨率卫星数据捕捉。

Method: 通过计算机科学和水文学专家的合作，开发了包含1,145张高分辨率图像（覆盖2,577平方公里）的RiverScope数据集，每张图像与Sentinel-2、SWOT和SWORD数据库共同注册。评估了多种深度学习架构（如CNN和Transformer）、预训练策略（如监督和自监督）和训练数据集（如ImageNet和卫星图像）。

Result: 建立了首个全球高分辨率河流宽度估计基准，中位误差为7.2米，显著优于现有卫星衍生方法。最佳性能模型结合了迁移学习和多光谱PlanetScope通道的使用。

Conclusion: RiverScope提供了一个高分辨率的数据集，显著提升了河流宽度估计的准确性，支持精细尺度和多传感器的水文建模，有助于气候适应和可持续水资源管理。

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Motivation: 传统视频合成流程依赖大量人力和专家协作，导致成本高且周期长。本文旨在通过生成模型自动化这一过程，提升效率并降低成本。

Method: 设计了基于DiT的管道，包括轻量级背景保留分支、DiT融合块和前景增强训练策略，并开发了ERoPE位置嵌入技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上优于现有解决方案，成功实现了生成式视频合成。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于Diffusion Transformer（DiT）的生成式视频合成方法，通过创新的背景保留分支、前景增强和ERoPE位置嵌入技术，有效实现了高质量的视频合成，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

Motivation: 重新思考文本到虚拟人生成模型，旨在解决基于SDS的模型和大型3D生成模型效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出TeRA框架，采用两阶段训练策略：首先从大型人体重建模型中蒸馏解码器以获取结构化潜在空间；随后训练文本控制的潜在扩散模型在该空间内生成逼真3D虚拟人。

Result: 实验证明TeRA在主观和客观评估中均优于先前的文本到虚拟人生成模型。

Conclusion: TeRA框架通过消除缓慢的迭代优化，并利用结构化3D人体表示，显著提升了文本到虚拟人生成模型的性能，实验证明其在主客观评估中均优于先前模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出AFPE位置编码方法，针对医学图像的各向异性特性优化，实验证明其在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中复杂形状和各向异性高维图像的挑战使得传统位置编码方法效果不佳，需要一种更适应医学图像特性的位置编码方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的各向异性傅里叶特征位置编码（AFPE），通过结合各向异性、类特定和域特定的空间依赖性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Result: AFPE在胸部X光的多标签分类、CT图像的器官分类和超声心动图的射血分数回归任务中显著优于现有位置编码方法。

Conclusion: 在医学图像和视频中，选择适合数据和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要，AFPE在所有测试的各向异性设置中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种轻量级且高效的框架，结合了预训练的2D CNN和带有空间注意力的LSTM网络，用于健身运动识别，具有实时性和可扩展性，适用于基于视觉的健康监测。

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Conclusion: 本文提出的MDM-MixMFL框架通过模态解耦和记忆机制，有效解决了非集中式混合模态MRI图像分割中的异质性问题，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无监督多目标发现方法依赖监督生成伪标签来训练对象中心学习模型的问题。

Method: 通过检索无相机运动的视频帧进行无监督光流运动分割，生成高质量的无监督伪标签，并利用这些伪标签细化DINOSAUR的slot表示，同时训练一个slot去激活模块来分配前景和背景。

Result: MR-DINOSAUR在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上表现优异，超越了之前的先进方法。

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上实现了强大的多目标发现效果，尽管完全无监督，但仍优于之前的先进方法。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Motivation: 现有的3D视觉基础模型在处理长序列图像输入时存在推理效率低下的问题，尤其是VGGT模型中的令牌崩溃现象限制了其性能。

Method: 提出FastVGGT，首次在3D领域利用训练免费机制加速VGGT，设计了针对3D架构和任务的独特令牌分区策略。

Conclusion: FastVGGT通过引入令牌合并技术，显著提升了VGGT在长序列图像输入下的推理效率，同时保持了其强大的3D重建能力，为可扩展的3D视觉系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种LLM辅助的关系三元组提取方法，用于软件工程标准的ontology生成，效果优于传统OpenIE方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在软件工程标准（SES）中自动化生成本体（AOG），需要有效处理长且非结构化的文本，关系三元组提取（RTE）是其中的关键步骤。

Method: 采用了一种开源大型语言模型（LLM）辅助的RTE方法，包括文档分割、候选术语挖掘、基于LLM的关系推理、术语归一化和跨部分对齐。

Result: 通过构建三个粒度级别的黄金标准基准评估，生成的ontology表现与OpenIE方法相当，甚至可能更优。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的LLM辅助方法在软件工程标准（SES）的关系三元组提取（RTE）中表现优异，甚至可能优于OpenIE方法。

Abstract: Ontologies have supported knowledge representation and whitebox reasoning for
decades; thus, the automated ontology generation (AOG) plays a crucial role in
scaling their use. Software engineering standards (SES) consist of long,
unstructured text (with high noise) and paragraphs with domain-specific terms.
In this setting, relation triple extraction (RTE), together with term
extraction, constitutes the first stage toward AOG. This work proposes an
open-source large language model (LLM)-assisted approach to RTE for SES.
Instead of solely relying on prompt-engineering-based methods, this study
promotes the use of LLMs as an aid in constructing ontologies and explores an
effective AOG workflow that includes document segmentation, candidate term
mining, LLM-based relation inference, term normalization, and cross-section
alignment. Golden-standard benchmarks at three granularities are constructed
and used to evaluate the ontology generated from the study. The results show
that it is comparable and potentially superior to the OpenIE method of triple
extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同编译器间的浮点不一致性可能损害数值软件的可靠性，因此需要一种有效的方法来检测这些不一致性。

Method: LLM4FP结合了基于语法的生成和基于反馈的变异，生成多样且有效的浮点程序，旨在触发编译器间的不一致性。

Result: LLM4FP在多个编译器和优化级别上评估，检测到的不一致性数量是现有工具Varity的两倍以上，且大多数涉及实值差异而非极端值（如NaN或无穷大）。

Conclusion: LLM4FP通过LLM引导的程序生成显著提高了数值不一致性的检测能力，相比现有工具Varity检测到两倍以上的不一致性，且覆盖了更广泛的优化级别和主机与设备编译器之间的不匹配。

Abstract: Floating-point inconsistencies across compilers can undermine the reliability
of numerical software. We present LLM4FP, the first framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate floating-point programs specifically
designed to trigger such inconsistencies. LLM4FP combines Grammar-Based
Generation and Feedback-Based Mutation to produce diverse and valid programs.
We evaluate LLM4FP across multiple compilers and optimization levels, measuring
inconsistency rate, time cost, and program diversity. LLM4FP detects over twice
as many inconsistencies compared to the state-of-the-art tool, Varity. Notably,
most of the inconsistencies involve real-valued differences, rather than
extreme values like NaN or infinities. LLM4FP also uncovers inconsistencies
across a wider range of optimization levels, and finds the most mismatches
between host and device compilers. These results show that LLM-guided program
generation improves the detection of numerical inconsistencies.

TL;DR: JS-TOD 是一个用于检测 JavaScript 测试顺序依赖性的工具，通过随机化和多次重新运行测试，揭示了共享文件和模拟状态是导致测试不稳定的主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试顺序依赖性是不稳定测试的主要原因之一。理想情况下，每个测试应独立运行并产生一致的结果，但实践中测试结果可能因执行顺序而异。JS-TOD 旨在通过工具化的方式解决这一问题。

Method: JS-TOD 采用系统化的方法，随机化测试、测试套件和描述块的顺序，并进行多次重新运行（默认设置为每种测试和测试套件进行10次重新排序和10次重新运行）。

Result: 评估结果显示，测试顺序依赖性的主要原因是测试之间共享文件和共享模拟状态。

Conclusion: JS-TOD 是一种有效的工具，能够通过系统化的方法检测和揭示 JavaScript 测试中的顺序依赖性，从而帮助开发者识别和解决测试不稳定性问题。

Abstract: We present JS-TOD (JavaScript Test Order-dependency Detector), a tool that
can extract, reorder, and rerun Jest tests to reveal possible order-dependent
test flakiness. Test order dependency is one of the leading causes of test
flakiness. Ideally, each test should operate in isolation and yield consistent
results no matter the sequence in which tests are run. However, in practice,
test outcomes can vary depending on their execution order. JS-TOD employed a
systematic approach to randomising tests, test suites, and describe blocks. The
tool is highly customisable, as one can set the number of orders and reruns
required (the default setting is 10 reorder and 10 reruns for each test and
test suite). Our evaluation using JS-TOD reveals two main causes of test order
dependency flakiness: shared files and shared mocking state between tests.

potential to increase the number of bug reports that development teams can
gather, thus potentially improving the rate at which bugs are identified and
fixed. However, audio bug reports exhibit specific characteristics that
challenge existing techniques for reproducing bugs. This paper discusses these
challenges based on a preliminary experiment, and motivates further research on

Motivation: 当前的需求工程实践（如CrowdRE和AI辅助策略）可能脱离文化、社会和政治背景，导致需求与人类价值观和实际需求不符。REConnect旨在重新将需求工程聚焦于人类连接，以确保系统与用户价值观和愿望一致。

Method: REConnect提出了一种以人为本的参与式方法，包括三个关键原则（建立信任关系、共同设计和赋予用户权力）和一套可操作实践（REActions），贯穿需求获取、分析和验证过程。

Result: 通过三个案例研究（BloodSync、Herluma和BridgingRoots），REConnect展示了其方法如何产生文化根基深厚、社会合法且可持续的需求。

Conclusion: REConnect强调在需求工程中重新以人为中心，通过建立信任关系、共同设计和赋予用户权力等原则，确保需求的文化根基和社会合法性。同时，在生成式AI时代，需通过参与式实践指导AI整合，以保护人类机构并增强其角色。

Abstract: Software increasingly shapes the infrastructures of daily life, making
requirements engineering (RE) central to ensuring that systems align with human
values and lived experiences. Yet, current popular practices such as CrowdRE
and AI-assisted elicitation strategies risk detaching requirements work from
the cultural, social, and political contexts that shape lived experiences,
human values, and real user needs. In this paper, we introduce REConnect that
re-centers RE on the human connection as central to the understanding of lived
experiences where impact is sought. REConnect advocates for a human-centered
participatory approach "that matters" to the communities and beneficiaries
involved, ensuring alignment with their values and aspirations. Drawing on
three case studies of societal impact: BloodSync in rural Nepal, Herluma
supporting women at risk of homelessness in Canada, and BridgingRoots to
revitalize Indigenous languages in the Canadian Arctic. REConnect argues that
three key principles and enablers: building trusting relationships,
co-designing with and alongside stakeholders, and empowering users as agents of
change, can yield requirements that are culturally grounded, socially
legitimate, and sustainable beyond system delivery. REConnect also proposes a
set of actionable practices (REActions) that embed relationality and ongoing
stakeholder engagement throughout requirements elicitation, analysis, and
validation of solution development. Finally, we situate REConnect in the era of
Generative AI. While AI can accelerate and scale certain RE tasks, its
integration must be guided by participatory practices that not only preserve
human agency but also empower humans' roles to become guardians of values and
ethics, inclusion amplifiers, curators of AI outputs, and co-reflectors in
iterative review cycles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高从访谈记录中提取和记录需求的效率，减少人工分析的工作量。

Method: 使用文本蕴涵技术从访谈记录中提取目标并构建目标模型。

Result: GPT-4o 提取的目标与人工提取的目标匹配率为 62.0%，目标溯源准确率为 98.7%，目标模型细化关系准确率为 72.2%。

Conclusion: GPT-4o 能够可靠地从访谈记录中提取目标，并构建目标模型，其准确性与人工提取相当。

Abstract: In software engineering, requirements may be acquired from stakeholders
through elicitation methods, such as interviews, observational studies, and
focus groups. When supporting acquisition from interviews, business analysts
must review transcripts to identify and document requirements. Goal modeling is
a popular technique for representing early stakeholder requirements as it lends
itself to various analyses, including refinement to map high-level goals into
software operations, and conflict and obstacle analysis. In this paper, we
describe an approach to use textual entailment to reliably extract goals from
interview transcripts and to construct goal models. The approach has been
evaluated on 15 interview transcripts across 29 application domains. The
findings show that GPT-4o can reliably extract goals from interview
transcripts, matching 62.0% of goals acquired by humans from the same
transcripts, and that GPT-4o can trace goals to originating text in the
transcript with 98.7% accuracy. In addition, when evaluated by human
annotators, GPT-4o generates goal model refinement relationships among
extracted goals with 72.2% accuracy.

TL;DR: Lin-Hunter 是一种新型 FPGA 逻辑综合工具测试框架，通过系统化生成多样化测试用例和自适应策略优化，显著提升了错误发现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 FPGA 逻辑综合工具的测试方法依赖随机策略，导致测试用例结构单一，无法充分验证工具功能。

Method: Lin-Hunter 引入了基于变形转换规则的测试用例生成方法，并结合 LinUCB 自适应策略选择机制，动态优化测试策略。

Result: Lin-Hunter 在三个月实验中发现了 18 个独特错误（含 10 个未报告缺陷），并在测试用例多样性和错误发现效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Lin-Hunter 是一种有效的测试框架，能够显著提升 HDL 测试用例的多样性和 FPGA 逻辑综合工具验证的效率，实验证明其发现了 18 个独特错误，包括 10 个未报告缺陷。

Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) play an indispensable role in
Electronic Design Automation (EDA), translating Register-Transfer Level (RTL)
designs into gate-level netlists. The correctness and reliability of FPGA logic
synthesis tools are critically important, as unnoticed bugs in these tools may
infect the final hardware implementations. However, recent approaches often
rely heavily on random selection strategies, limiting the structural diversity
of the generated HDL test cases and resulting in inadequate exploration of the
tool's feature space. To address this limitation, we propose Lin-Hunter, a
novel testing framework designed to systematically enhance the diversity of HDL
test cases and the efficiency of FPGA logic synthesis tool validation.
Specifically, Lin-Hunter introduces a principled set of metamorphic
transformation rules to generate functionally equivalent yet structurally
diverse HDL test case variants, effectively addressing the limited diversity of
existing test inputs. To further enhance bug discovery efficiency, Lin-Hunter
integrates an adaptive strategy selection mechanism based on the Linear Upper
Confidence Bound (LinUCB) method. This method leverages feedback from synthesis
logs of previously executed test cases to dynamically prioritize transformation
strategies that have empirically demonstrated a higher likelihood of triggering
synthesis bugs. Comprehensive experiments conducted over a three-month period
demonstrate the practical effectiveness of Lin-Hunter. Our method has
discovered 18 unique bugs, including 10 previously unreported defects, which
have been confirmed by official developers. Moreover, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art testing methods in both test-case diversity and bug-discovery
efficiency.

Motivation: 了解开源项目中政策驱动SBOM的现状，特别是那些为安全目标（如增强项目透明度和确保合规性）而创建的SBOM。

Method: 我们进行了软件仓库挖掘研究，收集并筛选了托管在GitHub上的SBOM文件，通过描述性统计分析了政策驱动SBOM中报告的信息及其依赖项的漏洞。

Result: 结果显示，只有0.56%的流行GitHub仓库包含政策驱动SBOM，这些依赖项包含2,202个独特漏洞，其中22%未报告许可信息。

Conclusion: 研究结果为SBOM的使用提供了支持安全评估和许可的见解。

Abstract: Background. The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a machine-readable list
of all the software dependencies included in a software. SBOM emerged as way to
assist securing the software supply chain. However, despite mandates from
governments to use SBOM, research on this artifact is still in its early
stages. Aims. We want to understand the current state of SBOM in open-source
projects, focusing specifically on policy-driven SBOMs, i.e., SBOM created to
achieve security goals, such as enhancing project transparency and ensuring
compliance, rather than being used as fixtures for tools or artificially
generated for benchmarking or academic research purposes. Method. We performed
a mining software repository study to collect and carefully select SBOM files
hosted on GitHub. We analyzed the information reported in policy-driven SBOMs
and the vulnerabilities associated with the declared dependencies by means of
descriptive statistics. Results. We show that only 0.56% of popular GitHub
repositories contain policy-driven SBOM. The declared dependencies contain
2,202 unique vulnerabilities, while 22% of them do not report licensing
information. Conclusion. Our findings provide insights for SBOM usage to
support security assessment and licensing.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究应用MT方法测试多模态HTP系统，通过MRs解决预言问题，并提出了基于概率分布距离的违反标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测人类轨迹对自动驾驶系统和移动机器人的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但多模态HTP模型的严格测试面临挑战，主要困难在于缺乏明确的测试预言。

Method: 提出了五种MRs，针对历史轨迹数据和语义分割地图的转换，包括标签保留的几何转换（镜像、旋转、缩放）和地图改变转换（更改语义类别标签、引入障碍物），并提出了基于概率分布距离度量的违反标准。

Result: 通过MRs解决了HTP系统的预言问题，并提出了基于概率分布距离度量的违反标准。

Conclusion: 本研究引入了一个MT框架，用于无预言的多模态、随机HTP系统测试。该框架能够评估模型对输入转换和上下文变化的鲁棒性，而不依赖于真实轨迹。

Abstract: Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and
reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile
robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory
Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g.,
trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs
(multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary
difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future
trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This
research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic
methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem
through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic
nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both
historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an
environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric
transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and
map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2)
Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing
obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose
probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability
distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This
study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of
multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model
robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without
reliance on ground-truth trajectories.

TL;DR: Specine是一种针对LLM代码生成的新规范对齐技术，通过提升规范感知和纠正偏差，显著提高了生成代码的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现实问题的复杂性，LLM生成的代码常与给定规范不完全一致，现有代理技术忽视了规范感知这一关键问题。

Method: 提出Specine技术，基于软件需求工程，识别并纠正LLM感知的编程规范与输入规范之间的偏差。

Result: Specine在五个竞争性基准测试中，对四种前沿LLM进行了全面实验，平均Pass@1提升了29.60\%，优于十种基线方法。

Conclusion: Specine通过识别未对齐的输入规范、提升LLM感知的规范并对其对齐，显著提升了LLM代码生成的性能，实验证明其在多个基准测试中优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Code generation refers to the automatic generation of source code based on a
given programming specification, which has garnered significant attention
particularly with the advancement of large language models (LLMs). However, due
to the inherent complexity of real-world problems, the LLM-generated code often
fails to fully align with the provided specification. While state-of-the-art
agent-based techniques have been proposed to enhance LLM code generation, they
overlook the critical issue of specification perception, resulting in
persistent misalignment issues. Given that accurate perception of programming
specifications serves as the foundation of the LLM-based code generation
paradigm, ensuring specification alignment is particularly crucial. In this
work, we draw on software requirements engineering to propose Specine, a novel
specification alignment technique for LLM code generation. Its key idea is to
identify misaligned input specifications, lift LLM-perceived specifications,
and align them to enhance the code generation performance of LLMs. Our
comprehensive experiments on four state-of-the-art LLMs across five challenging
competitive benchmarks by comparing with ten state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrate the effectiveness of Specine. For example, Specine outperforms the
most effective baseline, achieving an average improvement of 29.60\% across all
subjects in terms of Pass@1.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种集成模糊测试工具和SystemC模拟器的框架，解决了嵌入式软件测试中的灵活性和外围设备支持问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌入式软件测试中，现有解决方案通常将模糊测试工具与内置模拟器紧密耦合，缺乏对外围硬件的支持和灵活性。

Method: 通过开发一个解耦模糊测试工具和模拟器的框架，并拦截外围设备访问以查询模糊测试工具的值，从而将外围设备行为与模糊测试工具联系起来。

Result: 该框架实现了不同SystemC虚拟原型之间的灵活互换性，并通过与不同模拟器的集成和多种软件的测试展示了其灵活性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种框架，将基于American-Fuzzy-Lop的模糊测试工具与SystemC模拟器集成，解决了嵌入式软件测试中的灵活性和外围设备支持不足的问题。

Abstract: SystemC-based virtual prototypes have emerged as widely adopted tools to test
software ahead of hardware availability, reducing the time-to-market and
improving software reliability. Recently, fuzzing has become a popular method
for automated software testing due to its ability to quickly identify
corner-case errors. However, its application to embedded software is still
limited. Simulator tools can help bridge this gap by providing a more powerful
and controlled execution environment for testing. Existing solutions, however,
often tightly couple fuzzers with built-in simulators that lack support for
hardware peripherals and of- fer limited flexibility, restricting their ability
to test embedded software. To address these limitations, we present a framework
that allows the integration of American-Fuzzy-Lop-based fuzzers and
SystemC-based simulators. The framework provides a harness to decouple the
adopted fuzzer and simulator. In addition, it intercepts peripheral accesses
and queries the fuzzer for values, effectively linking peripheral behavior to
the fuzzer. This solution enables flexible interchangeability of peripher- als
within the simulation environment and supports the interfacing of different
SystemC-based virtual prototypes. The flexibility of the pro- posed solution is
demonstrated by integrating the harness with different simulators and by
testing various softwares.

Motivation: 由于任务型聊天机器人的普及，测试所有可能的对话场景具有挑战性，可能导致未发现的错误行为。

Method: 提出MUTABOT，一种突变测试方法，用于在对话中注入故障并产生模拟缺陷的故障聊天机器人。

Result: 实验表明，突变测试可以有效揭示测试套件的不足。

Conclusion: MUTABOT的扩展版本在多平台（Dialogflow和Rasa）上展示了其有效性，能够通过突变测试揭示Botium生成的测试套件的弱点。

Abstract: Chatbots, also known as conversational agents, have become ubiquitous,
offering services for a multitude of domains. Unlike general-purpose chatbots,
task-based chatbots are software designed to prioritize the completion of tasks
of the domain they handle (e.g., flight booking). Given the growing popularity
of chatbots, testing techniques that can generate full conversations as test
cases have emerged. Still, thoroughly testing all the possible conversational
scenarios implemented by a task-based chatbot is challenging, resulting in
incorrect behaviors that may remain unnoticed. To address this challenge, we
proposed MUTABOT, a mutation testing approach for injecting faults in
conversations and producing faulty chatbots that emulate defects that may
affect the conversational aspects. In this paper, we present our extension of
MUTABOT to multiple platforms (Dialogflow and Rasa), and present experiments
that show how mutation testing can be used to reveal weaknesses in test suites
generated by the Botium state-of-the-art test generator.

Motivation: 研究非技术债务（NTD）在大规模敏捷软件开发（ASD）环境中的影响及其驱动因素。

Method: 通过广泛的调查、深入访谈和统计分析，涉及多样化的软件专业人员群体。

Result: 确定了NTD的关键驱动因素及其影响，包括团队结构、心理安全、流程效率、社交碎片化和人力资源需求。

Conclusion: 通过实施团队优化、角色明确、心理安全培养、工作流程简化等策略，组织可以减少非技术债务，恢复敏捷性并释放团队潜力。

Abstract: NonTechnical Debt (NTD) is a common challenge in agile software development,
manifesting in four critical forms, Process Debt, Social Debt, People Debt,
Organizational debt. NODLA project is a collaboration between Karlstad
University and four leading Swedish industrial partners, reveals how various
debt types disrupt large scale Agile Software Development (ASD) environments.
Through extensive surveys, indepth interviews, and statistical analyses
involving a diverse group of software professionals, we identified key drivers
of NTD and their impacts. Our findings emphasize (1) Well structured, highly
cohesive teams learn faster, adapt more effectively, and innovate consistently.
(2) Psychological safety, fostered by proactive leadership, is essential for
innovation, experimentation, and keeping employees. (3) Inefficient processes
and unclear roles contribute significantly to drops in job satisfaction,
productivity and team morale. (4) Social fragmentation, particularly in remote
and hybrid settings, breeds rework, delays, and increased costs. (5) Neglected
human resource needs, such as delayed hiring or insufficient training, limit an
organization ability to meet growing demands. This white paper distils these
insights into practical, evidence based strategies, such as refining team
composition, clarifying roles, fostering psychological safety, streamlining
workflows, and embracing failure as a learning tool. By implementing these
strategies, organizations can reduce NTD, reclaim agility, and unlock their
teams full potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能反映真实世界的复杂性，限制了现代大型语言模型（LLMs）的评估。当前基准测试通常关注细粒度代码单元，缺乏完整项目上下文，并使用不充分的评估指标。

Method: 引入SWRBench，包含1000个手动验证的GitHub Pull Requests（PRs），提供PR为中心的审查和完整项目上下文。采用基于LLM的客观评估方法，与人类判断高度一致（约90%）。

Result: 主流ACR工具和LLMs在SWRBench上表现不佳，ACR工具更擅长检测功能错误。提出的多审查聚合策略显著提升了ACR性能，F1分数提高了43.67%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了SWRBench基准测试及其客观评估方法，全面研究了当前ACR的能力，并提出了一种有效的增强方法，为推进ACR研究提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Automated Code Review (ACR) is crucial for software quality, yet existing
benchmarks often fail to reflect real-world complexities, hindering the
evaluation of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Current benchmarks
frequently focus on fine-grained code units, lack complete project context, and
use inadequate evaluation metrics. To address these limitations, we introduce
SWRBench , a new benchmark comprising 1000 manually verified Pull Requests
(PRs) from GitHub, offering PR-centric review with full project context.
SWRBench employs an objective LLM-based evaluation method that aligns strongly
with human judgment (~90 agreement) by verifying if issues from a structured
ground truth are covered in generated reviews. Our systematic evaluation of
mainstream ACR tools and LLMs on SWRBench reveals that current systems
underperform, and ACR tools are more adept at detecting functional errors.
Subsequently, we propose and validate a simple multi-review aggregation
strategy that significantly boosts ACR performance, increasing F1 scores by up
to 43.67%. Our contributions include the SWRBench benchmark, its objective
evaluation method, a comprehensive study of current ACR capabilities, and an
effective enhancement approach, offering valuable insights for advancing ACR
research.

Motivation: 随着Web应用在关键领域的广泛使用，确保其无故障性能变得尤为重要。手动生成测试值耗时且易错，而现有的基于大型语言模型的工具通常依赖云基础设施，存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 该工具通过分析表单的HTML结构，检测输入类型，并根据每个字段的类型和上下文内容提取约束条件，指导正确的字段填充。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种本地化运行的隐私保护推荐工具，用于帮助测试人员在Web表单测试中生成有效的字段值，从而避免数据泄露和保密性问题。

Abstract: Web applications are increasingly used in critical domains such as education,
finance, and e-commerce. This highlights the need to ensure their failure-free
performance. One effective method for evaluating failure-free performance is
web form testing, where defining effective test scenarios is key to a complete
and accurate evaluation. A core aspect of this process involves filling form
fields with suitable values to create effective test cases. However, manually
generating these values is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this,
various tools have been developed to assist testers. With the appearance of
large language models (LLMs), a new generation of tools seeks to handle this
task more intelligently. Although many LLM-based tools have been introduced, as
these models typically rely on cloud infrastructure, their use in testing
confidential web forms raises concerns about unintended data leakage and
breaches of confidentiality. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving
recommender that operates locally using a large language model. The tool
assists testers in web form testing by suggesting effective field values. This
tool analyzes the HTML structure of forms, detects input types, and extracts
constraints based on each field's type and contextual content, guiding proper
field filling.

Motivation: 当前REST API模糊测试存在三个主要问题：认证处理、故障类型分类与比较以及案例研究标准化，亟需解决方案以推动研究进展。

Method: 通过开发WFC（开源库和模式定义）和WFD（36个开源API集合），支持实验运行和故障分类。使用EvoMaster等工具进行实验比较。

Result: WFC/WFD成功解决了上述问题，实验证明了其有效性，并提供了工具比较的指导原则。

Conclusion: 论文提出了Web Fuzzing Commons (WFC)和Web Fuzzing Dataset (WFD)来解决REST API模糊测试中的三个主要问题：认证处理、故障类型分类与比较以及案例研究标准化。通过实验验证了WFC/WFD的实用性，并提供了工具比较的指导原则。

Abstract: Fuzzing REST APIs is an important research problem, with practical
applications and impact in industry. As such, a lot of research work has been
carried out on this topic in the last few years. However, there are three major
issues that hinder further progress: how to deal with API authentication; how
to catalog and compare different fault types found by different fuzzers; and
what to use as case study to facilitate fair comparisons among fuzzers. To
address these important challenges, we present Web Fuzzing Commons (WFC) and
Web Fuzzing Dataset (WFD). WFC is a set of open-source libraries and schema
definitions to declaratively specify authentication info and catalog different
types of faults that fuzzers can automatically detect. WFD is a collection of
36 open-source APIs with all necessary scaffolding to easily run experiments
with fuzzers, supported by WFC. To show the usefulness of WFC/WFD, a set of
experiments is carried out with EvoMaster, a state-of-the-art fuzzer for Web
APIs. However, any fuzzer can benefit from WFC and WFD. We compare EvoMaster
with other state-of-the-art tools such as ARAT-RL, EmRest, LLamaRestTest,
RESTler, and Schemathesis. We discuss common pitfalls in tool comparisons, as
well as providing guidelines with support of WFC/WFD to avoid them.

Motivation: 开发者在提交补丁时常常缺乏问题重现测试，这增加了问题未被彻底解决或重新引入的风险。因此，自动化生成问题重现测试成为一个重要研究方向。

Method: BLAST通过结合LLMs和SBST技术，从问题-补丁对中自动生成问题重现测试。LLM部分通过git历史分析、静态分析和SBST生成的测试提取相关上下文；SBST部分则通过LLM生成的种子适应SBST优化。

Result: BLAST在精选的Python基准测试中成功生成问题重现测试的比例为35.4%，优于现有技术（23.5%）。在实际部署中，BLAST在32个PR-问题对中成功生成11个测试。

Conclusion: BLAST工具通过结合LLMs和SBST技术，能够自动生成问题重现测试，显著提高了测试生成的成功率（35.4%），并在实际开发中展示了其潜在价值。

Abstract: Issue-reproducing tests fail on buggy code and pass once a patch is applied,
thus increasing developers' confidence that the issue has been resolved and
will not be re-introduced. However, past research has shown that developers
often commit patches without such tests, making the automated generation of
issue-reproducing tests an area of interest. We propose BLAST, a tool for
automatically generating issue-reproducing tests from issue-patch pairs by
combining LLMs and search-based software testing (SBST). For the LLM part, we
complement the issue description and the patch by extracting relevant context
through git history analysis, static analysis, and SBST-generated tests. For
the SBST part, we adapt SBST for generating issue-reproducing tests; the issue
description and the patch are fed into the SBST optimization through an
intermediate LLM-generated seed, which we deserialize into SBST-compatible
form. BLAST successfully generates issue-reproducing tests for 151/426 (35.4%)
of the issues from a curated Python benchmark, outperforming the
state-of-the-art (23.5%). Additionally, to measure the real-world impact of
BLAST, we built a GitHub bot that runs BLAST whenever a new pull request (PR)
linked to an issue is opened, and if BLAST generates an issue-reproducing test,
the bot proposes it as a comment in the PR. We deployed the bot in three
open-source repositories for three months, gathering data from 32 PRs-issue
pairs. BLAST generated an issue-reproducing test in 11 of these cases, which we
proposed to the developers. By analyzing the developers' feedback, we discuss
challenges and opportunities for researchers and tool builders. Data and

### [232] [Tether: A Personalized Support Assistant for Software Engineers with ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01946)
*Aarsh Shah,Cleyton Magalhaes,Kiev Gama,Ronnie de Souza Santos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Tether是一款LLM驱动的桌面应用，专为ADHD开发者设计，通过实时监控和个性化支持改善其工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程中的公平性、多样性和包容性常忽视神经多样性，尤其是ADHD开发者的体验。现有工具较少针对其认知挑战（如持续注意力、任务启动、自我调节）设计。

Method: 结合局部活动监控、检索增强生成（RAG）和游戏化技术，提供实时焦点支持和个性化对话。

Result: 初步自我验证显示，通过迭代提示优化和RAG增强，上下文准确性有所提升。Tether通过适应性和与软件开发流程及ADHD相关挑战的对齐，区别于通用工具。

Conclusion: Tether为神经多样性（特别是ADHD）开发者提供了潜在的支持工具，为未来SE领域的神经多样性意识工具奠定了基础，并展示了LLMs作为个性化支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Equity, diversity, and inclusion in software engineering often overlook
neurodiversity, particularly the experiences of developers with Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Despite the growing awareness about that
population in SE, few tools are designed to support their cognitive challenges
(e.g., sustained attention, task initiation, self-regulation) within
development workflows. We present Tether, an LLM-powered desktop application
designed to support software engineers with ADHD by delivering adaptive,
context-aware assistance. Drawing from engineering research methodology, Tether
combines local activity monitoring, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and
gamification to offer real-time focus support and personalized dialogue. The
system integrates operating system level system tracking to prompt engagement
and its chatbot leverages ADHD-specific resources to offer relevant responses.
Preliminary validation through self-use revealed improved contextual accuracy
following iterative prompt refinements and RAG enhancements. Tether
differentiates itself from generic tools by being adaptable and aligned with
software-specific workflows and ADHD-related challenges. While not yet
evaluated by target users, this work lays the foundation for future
neurodiversity-aware tools in SE and highlights the potential of LLMs as
personalized support systems for underrepresented cognitive needs.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合统计程序分析和LLM推理的框架，用于自动修复C程序，实验显示其修复准确率显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动化修复C程序中的潜力，旨在结合统计程序分析和LLM推理，提高自动程序修复（APR）的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出了一个框架，结合了基于频谱的故障定位（SBFL）、运行时反馈和Chain-of-Thought结构化提示，形成一个自主修复循环。该方法通过迭代修复周期，利用结构化Chain-of-Thought提示方法，模型在生成新候选补丁前会分析失败测试、可疑代码区域和先前补丁结果。

Result: 在Codeflaws基准测试的3,902个错误上，该方法达到了44.93%的修复准确率，比现有最先进的APR基线（如GPT-4 with CoT）提高了3.61%的绝对改进。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将统计程序分析与生成式AI结合的实用途径，通过集成SBFL、运行时反馈和Chain-of-Thought结构化提示，实现了C程序自动修复的显著改进。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automating the repair of C programs. We present a framework that integrates
spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and
Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike
prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis
with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing
tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new
candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the
results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent
modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain
unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where
our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute
improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT.
This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical
program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.

TL;DR: ProbTest是一种新型概率程序测试方法，基于优惠券收集问题理论，自动确定测试次数，简化测试流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率程序的随机性导致测试困难，传统方法需要大量重复执行，缺乏效率。

Method: ProbTest是一种基于优惠券收集问题理论的黑色盒单元测试方法，自动确定所需的测试执行次数，并实现为PyTest的插件。

Result: ProbTest在Gymnasium强化学习库和随机数据结构案例中验证了其有效性，开发者可以像编写普通Python程序一样编写测试。

Conclusion: ProbTest提供了一种基于统计学保证的自动化测试方法，有效解决了概率程序测试中需要重复执行的挑战，简化了开发者的测试工作。

Abstract: Testing probabilistic programs is non-trivial due to their stochastic nature.
Given an input, the program may produce different outcomes depending on the
underlying stochastic choices in the program. This means testing the expected
outcomes of probabilistic programs requires repeated test executions unlike
deterministic programs where a single execution may suffice for each test
input. This raises the following question: how many times should we run a
probabilistic program to effectively test it? This work proposes a novel
black-box unit testing method, ProbTest, for testing the outcomes of
probabilistic programs. Our method is founded on the theory surrounding a
well-known combinatorial problem, the coupon collector's problem. Using this
method, developers can write unit tests as usual without extra effort while the
number of required test executions is determined automatically with statistical
guarantees for the results. We implement ProbTest as a plug-in for PyTest, a
well-known unit testing tool for python programs. Using this plug-in,
developers can write unit tests similar to any other Python program and the
necessary test executions are handled automatically. We evaluate the method on
case studies from the Gymnasium reinforcement learning library and a randomized
data structure.

Motivation: 在面向对象语言中，软件开发人员依赖线程安全类来实现并发应用程序。然而，确定一个类是否线程安全是一项具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 本文提出了一种高度可扩展的方法来分析Java类中的线程安全性，基于Java内存模型的正确性原则（数据竞争自由），并设计了一组确保线程安全性的属性。这些属性被编码到静态分析工具CodeQL中，以自动分析Java源代码。

Result: 在GitHub前1000个仓库的评估中，分析了3,632,865个Java类，检测到数千个线程安全性错误。查询运行时间在200k行代码以下的仓库中低于2分钟。

Conclusion: 本文的方法在分析现实世界代码库中的线程安全性方面展示了其适用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In object-oriented languages software developers rely on thread-safe classes
to implement concurrent applications. However, determining whether a class is
thread-safe is a challenging task. This paper presents a highly scalable method
to analyze thread-safety in Java classes. We provide a definition of
thread-safety for Java classes founded on the correctness principle of the Java
memory model, data race freedom. We devise a set of properties for Java classes
that are proven to ensure thread-safety. We encode these properties in the
static analysis tool CodeQL to automatically analyze Java source code. We
perform an evaluation on the top 1000 GitHub repositories. The evaluation
comprises 3632865 Java classes; with 1992 classes annotated as @ThreadSafe from
71 repositories. These repositories include highly popular software such as
Apache Flink (24.6k stars), Facebook Fresco (17.1k stars), PrestoDB (16.2k
starts), and gRPC (11.6k starts). Our queries detected thousands of
thread-safety errors. The running time of our queries is below 2 minutes for
repositories up to 200k lines of code, 20k methods, 6000 fields, and 1200
classes. We have submitted a selection of detected concurrency errors as PRs,
and developers positively reacted to these PRs. We have submitted our CodeQL
queries to the main CodeQL repository, and they are currently in the process of
becoming available as part of GitHub actions. The results demonstrate the
applicability and scalability of our method to analyze thread-safety in
real-world code bases.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CureFuzz通过好奇心机制和多目标种子选择，有效发现并修复SDMs中的崩溃触发场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDMs在安全关键应用中易学习不安全行为，现有测试框架难以发现多样化的崩溃触发场景。

Method: 提出了一种好奇心驱动的黑盒模糊测试方法CureFuzz，结合多目标种子选择技术。

Result: CureFuzz在故障数量和崩溃触发场景多样性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CureFuzz 被证明是一种有效的测试工具，不仅能发现SDMs中的故障，还能通过其发现的崩溃触发场景修复SDMs。

Abstract: Sequential decision-making processes (SDPs) are fundamental for complex
real-world challenges, such as autonomous driving, robotic control, and traffic
management. While recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) have led to mature
solutions for solving these complex problems, SDMs remain vulnerable to
learning unsafe behaviors, posing significant risks in safety-critical
applications. However, developing a testing framework for SDMs that can
identify a diverse set of crash-triggering scenarios remains an open challenge.
To address this, we propose CureFuzz, a novel curiosity-driven black-box fuzz
testing approach for SDMs. CureFuzz proposes a curiosity mechanism that allows
a fuzzer to effectively explore novel and diverse scenarios, leading to
improved detection of crashtriggering scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a
multi-objective seed selection technique to balance the exploration of novel
scenarios and the generation of crash-triggering scenarios, thereby optimizing
the fuzzing process. We evaluate CureFuzz on various SDMs and experimental
results demonstrate that CureFuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a
substantial margin in the total number of faults and distinct types of
crash-triggering scenarios. We also demonstrate that the crash-triggering
scenarios found by CureFuzz can repair SDMs, highlighting CureFuzz as a
valuable tool for testing SDMs and optimizing their performance.

*Pin Ji,Yang Feng,Zongtai Li,Xiangchi Zhou,Jia Liu,Jun Sun,Zhihong Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Txt2Sce是一种基于文本事故报告生成OpenSCENARIO格式测试场景的方法，通过LLM转换和场景树生成，有效提升了自动驾驶系统的测试效率和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统（ADSs）在安全关键领域的广泛应用，复杂场景中的挑战仍然存在。基于场景的测试对于识别缺陷和确保可靠性能至关重要，但现有方法通常依赖于视觉数据，且缺乏标准化场景格式，限制了其可扩展性和可移植性。

Method: Txt2Sce首先使用LLM将文本事故报告转换为相应的OpenSCENARIO场景文件，然后通过场景分解、场景块突变和场景组装生成基于推导的场景文件树。

Result: 实验中使用Txt2Sce生成了33个场景文件树，共计4,373个场景文件用于测试Autoware。结果表明，Txt2Sce成功转换文本报告，并通过突变增强场景多样性，有效检测了Autoware的意外行为。

Conclusion: Txt2Sce方法成功将文本事故报告转换为有效的OpenSCENARIO文件，并通过突变增强场景多样性，有效检测了Autoware在安全性、智能性和平滑性方面的意外行为。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning and related technologies,
Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) have made significant progress and are
gradually being widely applied in safety-critical fields. However, numerous
accident reports show that ADSs still encounter challenges in complex
scenarios. As a result, scenario-based testing has become essential for
identifying defects and ensuring reliable performance. In particular,
real-world accident reports offer valuable high-risk scenarios for more
targeted ADS testing. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on
visual data, which demands large memory and manual annotation. Additionally,
since existing methods do not adopt standardized scenario formats (e.g.,
OpenSCENARIO), the generated scenarios are often tied to specific platforms and
ADS implementations, limiting their scalability and portability. To address
these challenges, we propose Txt2Sce, a method for generating test scenarios in
OpenSCENARIO format based on textual accident reports. Txt2Sce first uses a LLM
to convert textual accident reports into corresponding OpenSCENARIO scenario
files. It then generates a derivation-based scenario file tree through scenario
disassembly, scenario block mutation, and scenario assembly. By utilizing the
derivation relationships between nodes in the scenario tree, Txt2Sce helps
developers identify the scenario conditions that trigger unexpected behaviors
of ADSs. In the experiments, we employ Txt2Sce to generate 33 scenario file
trees, resulting in a total of 4,373 scenario files for testing the open-source
ADS, Autoware. The experimental results show that Txt2Sce successfully converts
textual reports into valid OpenSCENARIO files, enhances scenario diversity
through mutation, and effectively detects unexpected behaviors of Autoware in
terms of safety, smartness, and smoothness.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种使用Pkl语言形式化操作设计域（ODD）的方法，解决了规范灵活性与一致性的挑战，并通过汽车示例展示了其广泛适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动化功能的部署，传统依赖人类操作员的系统需要新的评估框架来证明其在现实条件下不会引入不可接受的风险。ODD的形式化是这一过程的关键，但存在灵活性和一致性难以兼顾的挑战。

Method: 通过Pkl语言的专用配置语言特性，本文展示了如何形式化ODD，并以汽车行业为例进行了说明。

Result: 提出的方法不仅提高了ODD规范的可用性，还能广泛应用于确保操作环境的严格评估。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种使用Pkl语言形式化操作设计域（ODD）的方法，解决了在保持灵活性和一致性的同时，将ODD规范无缝集成到开发、验证和评估中的挑战。

Abstract: The deployment of automated functions that can operate without direct human
supervision has changed safety evaluation in domains seeking higher levels of
automation. Unlike conventional systems that rely on human operators, these
functions require new assessment frameworks to demonstrate that they do not
introduce unacceptable risks under real-world conditions. To make a convincing
safety claim, the developer must present a thorough justification argument,
supported by evidence, that a function is free from unreasonable risk when
operated in its intended context. The key concept relevant to the presented
work is the intended context, often captured by an Operational Design Domain
specification (ODD). ODD formalization is challenging due to the need to
maintain flexibility in adopting diverse specification formats while preserving
consistency and traceability and integrating seamlessly into the development,
validation, and assessment. This paper presents a way to formalize an ODD in
the Pkl language, addressing central challenges in specifying ODDs while
improving usability through specialized configuration language features. The
approach is illustrated with an automotive example but can be broadly applied
to ensure rigorous assessments of operational contexts.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通过整合ODD参数和测试属性来自动评估测试环境适用性的方法，并通过自动倒车卡车功能的案例研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of Connected, Cooperative, and Automated Mobility (CCAM)
systems has significantly transformed the safety assessment landscape. Because
they integrate automated vehicle functions beyond those managed by a human
driver, new methods are required to evaluate their safety. Approaches that
compile evidence from multiple test environments have been proposed for
type-approval and similar evaluations, emphasizing scenario coverage within the
systems Operational Design Domain (ODD). However, aligning diverse test
environment requirements with distinct testing capabilities remains
challenging. This paper presents a method for evaluating the suitability of
test case allocation to various test environments by drawing on and extending
an existing ODD formalization with key testing attributes. The resulting
construct integrates ODD parameters and additional test attributes to capture a
given test environments relevant capabilities. This approach supports automatic
suitability evaluation and is demonstrated through a case study on an automated
reversing truck function. The system's implementation fidelity is tied to ODD
parameters, facilitating automated test case allocation based on each
environments capacity for object-detection sensor assessment.

Motivation: 现有代码修复方法存在高训练成本或计算昂贵的推理问题，传统的检索策略无法捕捉代码的结构复杂性，导致检索质量不佳。ReCode旨在解决这些限制，提供更准确和高效的代码修复方案。

Method: ReCode引入了两种关键创新：1）基于初步算法类型预测的算法感知检索策略；2）模块化双编码器架构，分别处理代码和文本输入，实现输入与检索上下文之间的细粒度语义匹配。此外，提出了RACodeBench基准，支持更现实的评估。

Conclusion: ReCode通过其细粒度的检索增强上下文学习框架，显著提高了代码修复的准确性并降低了推理成本，展示了在实际代码修复场景中的实用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated
program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches
for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive
inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context
learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional
retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings,
fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal
retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a
fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for
accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key
innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search
space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular
dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs,
enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts.
Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from
real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of
synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on
RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode
achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost,
highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在图形度量下将Multi-Path TSP近似因子降至2倍的算法，并扩展至Ordered TSP，获得1.791倍的近似结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Path TSP是路径TSP的推广，近期在路径TSP的最佳算法中发挥了重要作用。尽管已有2.214倍的近似算法，但在图形度量下是否能获得更好的结果仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 算法基于从LP最优解对应的流分解中采样路径，并通过双倍边连接剩余顶点。通过分析，证明了采样路径的成本可以被吸收而不增加近似因子。

Result: 在图形度量下，Multi-Path TSP的近似保证可降至2倍，且该思路可进一步将Ordered TSP的近似因子提升至1.791倍。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在图形度量下，Multi-Path TSP可以获得显著更好的近似保证（2倍），并提出了一种基于LP最优解路径采样的算法。此外，还展示了如何将这一思路应用于Ordered TSP，在图形度量下获得1.791倍的近似算法。

Abstract: The path version of the Traveling Salesman Problem is one of the most
well-studied variants of the ubiquitous TSP. Its generalization, the Multi-Path
TSP, has recently been used in the best known algorithm for path TSP by Traub
and Vygen [Cambridge University Press, 2024]. The best known approximation
factor for this problem is $2.214$ by B\"{o}hm, Friggstad, M\"{o}mke and
Spoerhase [SODA 2025]. In this paper we show that for the case of graphic
metrics, a significantly better approximation guarantee of $2$ can be attained.
Our algorithm is based on sampling paths from a decomposition of the flow
corresponding to the optimal solution to the LP for the problem, and connecting
the left-out vertices with doubled edges. The cost of the latter is twice the
optimum in the worst case; we show how the cost of the sampled paths can be
absorbed into it without increasing the approximation factor. Furthermore, we
prove that any below-$2$ approximation algorithm for the special case of the
problem where each source is the same as the corresponding sink yields a
below-$2$ approximation algorithm for Graphic Multi-Path TSP.
  We also show that our ideas can be utilized to give a factor
$1.791$-approximation algorithm for Ordered TSP in graphic metrics, for which
the aforementioned paper [SODA 2025] and Armbruster, Mnich and N\"agele [APPROX
2024] give a $1.868$-approximation algorithm in general metrics.

Abstract: Windowed recurrences are sliding window calculations where a function is
applied iteratively across the window of data, and are ubiquitous throughout
the natural, social, and computational sciences. In this monograph we explore
the computational aspects of these calculations, including sequential and
parallel computation, and develop the theory underlying the algorithms and
their applicability. We introduce an efficient new sequential algorithm with
low latency, and develop new techniques to derive and analyze the complexity
and domain of validity of existing sequential algorithms. For parallel
computation we derive new parallel and vector algorithms by relating windowed
recurrences to the algebraic construction of semidirect products, and to
algorithms for exponentiation in semigroups. In the middle chapters of the
monograph we further develop the theory of semi-associativity and the algebraic
conditions for representing function composition and function application by
data. This systematizes the techniques used by practitioners to parallelize
recurrence calculations. We end the monograph with an extensive gallery of
examples of interest to specialists in many fields. Throughout the monograph
new algorithms are described with pseudo-code transcribed from functioning
source code.

TL;DR: 论文提出了HTCount和HTCount-P算法，解决了超图流中三角形计数的现有限制，通过动态采样和内存分区实现了高精度和低误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键限制：（i）对超顶点三角形结构的分类不完整，通常只考虑内部或外部三角形；（ii）采样方案不灵活，预定义采样超边数，这在严格内存约束下不切实际。

Method: 论文首先引入了对超顶点三角形的完整分类，包括内部、混合和外部三角形。基于此，开发了HTCount（一种基于水库的算法，动态调整样本大小以适应可用内存M）和HTCount-P（一种基于分区的变体，自适应地将未使用内存划分为独立样本子集）。

Result: 案例研究展示了三角形结构在揭示有意义交互模式方面的表达能力。在真实世界超图上的大量实验表明，两种算法在严格内存约束下均实现了高精度的三角形计数估计。

Conclusion: 论文提出的HTCount和HTCount-P算法在严格内存约束下实现了高精度的三角形计数估计，相对误差比现有方法低1到2个数量级，且具有一致的高吞吐量。

Abstract: Triangle counting in hypergraph streams, including both hyper-vertex and
hyper-edge triangles, is a fundamental problem in hypergraph analytics, with
broad applications. However, existing methods face two key limitations: (i) an
incomplete classification of hyper-vertex triangle structures, typically
considering only inner or outer triangles; and (ii) inflexible sampling schemes
that predefine the number of sampled hyperedges, which is impractical under
strict memory constraints due to highly variable hyperedge sizes. To address
these challenges, we first introduce a complete classification of hyper-vertex
triangles, including inner, hybrid, and outer triangles. Based on this, we
develop HTCount, a reservoir-based algorithm that dynamically adjusts the
sample size based on the available memory M. To further improve memory
utilization and reduce estimation error, we develop HTCount-P, a
partition-based variant that adaptively partitions unused memory into
independent sample subsets. We provide theoretical analysis of the unbiasedness
and variance bounds of the proposed algorithms. Case studies demonstrate the
expressiveness of our triangle structures in revealing meaningful interaction
patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs show that both our
algorithms achieve highly accurate triangle count estimates under strict memory
constraints, with relative errors that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower
than those of existing methods and consistently high throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究k-excluding顶点的检测复杂度，源于秘密共享方案中的问题。

Method: 研究k-excluding顶点的检测复杂度，通过分析不同k值范围下的图性质。

Result: 展示了k-excluding顶点存在性的阈值，并证明了在不同k值范围内的计算复杂度差异。

Conclusion: 对于足够大的n，当k > (1/4 + ε)n时，每个n个顶点的图都必须有一个k-excluding顶点，并且可以在多项式时间内找到这样的顶点。相反，当k < (1/4 - ε)n时，判定图是否没有k-excluding顶点是NP难的。

Abstract: For a graph $G$ and a parameter $k$, we call a vertex $k$-enabling if it
belongs both to a clique of size $k$ and to an independent set of size $k$, and
we call it $k$-excluding otherwise. Motivated by issues that arise in secret
sharing schemes, we study the complexity of detecting vertices that are
$k$-excluding. We show that for every $\epsilon$, for sufficiently large $n$,
if $k > (\frac{1}{4} + \epsilon)n$, then every graph on $n$ vertices must have
a $k$-excluding vertex, and moreover, such a vertex can be found in polynomial
time. In contrast, if $k < (\frac{1}{4} - \epsilon)n$, a regime in which it

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在具有恒定查询时间的距离预言机上，而对非恒定查询时间的研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白，探索空间、拉伸和查询时间之间的权衡。

Method: 论文研究了加权和非加权图中拉伸<2和≥2的不同机制下的距离预言机，构建了具有特定拉伸、空间和查询时间的新型距离预言机。

Result: 论文提出了一种新型距离预言机，具有$(2k(1 - 2r) - 1)$-拉伸，$\tilde{O}(m + n^{1 + 1/k})$空间和$\tilde{O}(\mu n^r)$查询时间，并展示了其在n-PSP和ANSC问题中的应用。

Conclusion: 该论文通过对距离预言机的全面研究，特别是在非恒定查询时间下的权衡，提出了新的三向权衡关系，并展示了其在n-Pairs最短路径问题和所有节点最短周期问题中的应用。

Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and
let $\mu = m/n$. A \emph{distance oracle} is a data structure designed to
answer approximate distance queries, with the goal of achieving low stretch,
efficient space usage, and fast query time. While much of the prior work
focused on distance oracles with constant query time, this paper presents a
comprehensive study of distance oracles with non-constant query time. We
explore the tradeoffs between space, stretch, and query time of distance
oracles in various regimes. Specifically, we consider both weighted and
unweighted graphs in the regimes of stretch $< 2$ and stretch $\ge 2$. Among
our results, we present a new three-way trade-off between stretch, space, and
query time, offering a natural extension of the classical Thorup-Zwick distance
oracle [STOC'01 and JACM'05] to regimes with larger query time. Specifically,
for any $0 < r < 1/2$ and integer $k \ge 1$, we construct a $(2k(1 - 2r) -
1)$-stretch distance oracle with $\tilde{O}(m + n^{1 + 1/k})$ space and
$\tilde{O}(\mu n^r)$ query time. In addition, we demonstrate several
applications of our new distance oracles to the $n$-Pairs Shortest Paths
($n$-PSP) problem and the All Nodes Shortest Cycles ($ANSC$) problem.

Abstract: We study the precedence-constrained resource scheduling problem [SICOMP'75].
There are $n$ jobs where each job takes a certain time to finish and has a
resource requirement throughout the execution time. There are precedence among
the jobs. The problem asks that given a resource budget, schedule the jobs
obeying the precedence constraints to minimize makespan (maximum completion
time of a job) such that at any point in time, the total resource being used by
all the jobs is at most the given resource budget. In the offline setting, an
important open question is whether a polynomial-time $O(1)$-factor
approximation algorithm can be found. We prove almost tight hardness of
approximation: For some constant $\alpha > 0$, there is no $o((\log
t_{\max})^{\alpha})$-factor ( or $o( ( \log n )^\alpha )$-factor )
approximation algorithm with $n$ jobs of maximum job length $t_{\max}$, unless
P = NP ( or NP $\subset$ DTIME$(O( 2^{\text{polylog}(n)}))$ ).
  We further show a connection between this scheduling problem and a seemingly
unrelated problem called the shortest common super-sequence (SCS) problem,
which has wide application in Biology and Genomics. We prove that an $o(\log
t_{\max})$-factor approximation of the scheduling problem would imply the
existence of an $o(|\Sigma|)$-approximation algorithm for SCS with alphabet
$\Sigma$.
  We then consider the online setting. We present $\Omega(\log n)$ and
$\Omega(\log t_{\max})$ lower bounds of the competitive ratio of any randomized
online algorithm. Moreover, we present a matching $O(\min\{\log n, \log
t_{\max}\})$-competitive deterministic online algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Hitting Geodesic Intervals问题的复杂性研究，证明了其在多种图结构上的NP完全性，并提出了基于特定参数的固定参数算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Aravind和Saxena的研究，全面探讨Hitting Geodesic Intervals问题在不同结构图参数下的复杂性。

Method: 通过修改已有证明，展示了该问题在多种特定图结构上的NP完全性，并设计了基于参数k和modular-width或vertex integrity的固定参数算法。

Result: 证明了该问题在多种图结构上的NP完全性，并提出了固定参数算法，同时展示了某些参数化设置的W[2]-完全性。

Conclusion: 本文展示了Hitting Geodesic Intervals问题在多种结构图参数下的复杂性对比，既提供了负面结果的NP完全性证明，也提出了基于参数k和特定结构参数的固定参数算法。

Abstract: Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a set $T$ of vertex pairs, and an integer $k$,
Hitting Geodesic Intervals asks whether there is a set $S \subseteq V$ of size
at most $k$ such that for each terminal pair $\{u,v\} \in T$, the set $S$
intersects at least one shortest $u$-$v$ path. Aravind and Saxena [WALCOM 2024]
introduced this problem and showed several parameterized complexity results. In
this paper, we extend the known results in both negative and positive
directions and present sharp complexity contrasts with respect to structural
graph parameters.
  We first show that the problem is NP-complete even on graphs obtained by
adding a single vertex to a disjoint union of 5-vertex paths. By modifying the
proof of this result, we also show the NP-completeness on graphs obtained from
a path by adding one vertex and on graphs obtained from a disjoint union of
triangles by adding one universal vertex. Furthermore, we show the
NP-completeness on graphs of bandwidth 4 and maximum degree 5 by replacing the
universal vertex in the last case with a long path. Under standard complexity
assumptions, these negative results rule out fixed-parameter algorithms for
most of the structural parameters studied in the literature (if the solution
size $k$ is not part of the parameter).
  We next present fixed-parameter algorithms parameterized by $k$ plus
modular-width and by $k$ plus vertex integrity. The algorithm for the latter
case does indeed solve a more general setting that includes the
parameterization by the minimum vertex multiway-cut size of the terminal
vertices. We show that this is tight in the sense that the problem
parameterized by the minimum vertex multicut size of the terminal pairs is
W[2]-complete. We then modify the proof of this intractability result and show
that the problem is W[2]-complete parameterized by $k$ even in the setting
where $T = \binom{Q}{2}$ for some $Q \subseteq V$.

TL;DR: 论文设计了两种FPT算法，用于拟阵约束下的子模最大化，分别针对离线和流式设置，均达到接近最优的近似比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在拟阵约束下（非单调）子模最大化的固定参数可处理（FPT）算法，其中拟阵秩r被视为固定参数，独立于元素总数n。

Method: 设计了两种FPT算法：一种用于离线设置，另一种用于随机顺序流式设置。离线算法使用指数级运行时间和多项式内存，流式算法则使用多项式内存。

Result: 离线算法获得$1-\frac{1}{e}-\varepsilon$近似比，流式算法获得$\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$近似比，两者均接近最优。

Conclusion: 论文展示了在FPT框架下，单调和非单调子模最大化在拟阵约束下几乎没有分离，离线算法和流式算法均达到了接近最优的近似比。

Abstract: In this paper, we design fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for
(non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint, where
the matroid rank $r$ is treated as a fixed parameter that is independent of the
total number of elements $n$. We provide two FPT algorithms: one for the
offline setting and another for the random-order streaming setting. Our
streaming algorithm achieves a $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ approximation using
$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{r}{\textrm{poly}(\varepsilon)}\right)$ memory, while
our offline algorithm obtains a $1-\frac{1}{e}-\varepsilon$ approximation with
$n\cdot 2^{\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{r}{\textrm{poly}(\varepsilon)}\right)}$
runtime and $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{r}{\textrm{poly}(\varepsilon)}\right)$
memory. Both approximation factors are near-optimal in their respective
settings, given existing hardness results. In particular, our offline algorithm
demonstrates that--unlike in the polynomial-time regime--there is essentially
no separation between monotone and non-monotone submodular maximization under a
matroid constraint in the FPT framework.

TL;DR: 论文优化了$k$-mismatch repeats的算法复杂度，并应用于参数化平方计算，提出了更高效的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究$k$-mismatch repeats和参数化平方的计算问题，以提高算法效率并改进现有结果。

Method: 通过分析$k$-mismatch repeats的数量上界，优化了Kolpakov和Kucherov的算法复杂度，并扩展到参数化平方的计算。

Result: 证明了$output=O(nk \log k)$，并提出了计算非等价参数化平方的$O(n\sigma \log \sigma)$时间算法，以及计算非等价参数化平方数量的$O(n \log n)$时间算法。

Conclusion: 论文通过优化计算$k$-mismatch repeats的算法复杂度，进一步应用于参数化平方的计算，提出了更高效的算法。

Abstract: A $k$-mismatch square is a string of the form $XY$ where $X$ and $Y$ are two
equal-length strings that have at most $k$ mismatches. Kolpakov and Kucherov
[Theor. Comput. Sci., 2003] defined two notions of $k$-mismatch repeats, called
$k$-repetitions and $k$-runs, each representing a sequence of consecutive
$k$-mismatch squares of equal length. They proposed algorithms for computing
$k$-repetitions and $k$-runs working in $O(nk \log k + output)$ time for a
string of length $n$ over an integer alphabet, where $output$ is the number of
the reported repeats. We show that $output=O(nk \log k)$, both in case of
$k$-repetitions and $k$-runs, which implies that the complexity of their
algorithms is actually $O(nk \log k)$. We apply this result to computing
parameterized squares.
  A parameterized square is a string of the form $XY$ such that $X$ and $Y$
parameterized-match, i.e., there exists a bijection $f$ on the alphabet such
that $f(X) = Y$. Two parameterized squares $XY$ and $X'Y'$ are equivalent if
they parameterized match. Recently Hamai et al. [SPIRE 2024] showed that a
string of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$ contains less than
$n\sigma$ non-equivalent parameterized squares, improving an earlier bound by
Kociumaka et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci., 2016]. We apply our bound for
$k$-mismatch repeats to propose an algorithm that reports all non-equivalent
parameterized squares in $O(n\sigma \log \sigma)$ time. We also show that the
number of non-equivalent parameterized squares can be computed in $O(n \log n)$
time. This last algorithm applies to squares under any substring compatible
equivalence relation and also to counting squares that are distinct as strings.
In particular, this improves upon the $O(n\sigma)$-time algorithm of
Gawrychowski et al. [CPM 2023] for counting order-preserving squares that are
distinct as strings if $\sigma = \omega(\log n)$.

Result: 在未加权图中，算法实现了$	ilde{O}(m)$的实例规模和额外时间；在加权图中，实例规模和运行时间增加到$	ilde{O}(n^2)$。此外，算法首次在超图中实现了类似的紧密度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种简单高效的算法，将Gomory-Hu树的构建问题转化为多对数次最大流计算，适用于未加权和加权图，并首次在超图中实现了类似的紧密度。

Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E,w)$, a Gomory-Hu tree $T$ (Gomory and Hu,
1961) is a tree on $V$ that preserves all-pairs mincuts of $G$ exactly.
  We present a simple, efficient reduction from Gomory-Hu trees to polylog
maxflow computations. On unweighted graphs, our reduction reduces to maxflow
computations on graphs of total instance size $\tilde{O}(m)$ and the algorithm
requires only $\tilde{O}(m)$ additional time. Our reduction is the first that
is tight up to polylog factors. The reduction also seamlessly extends to
weighted graphs, however, instance sizes and runtime increase to
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$.
  Finally, we show how to extend our reduction to reduce Gomory-Hu trees for
unweighted hypergraphs to maxflow in hypergraphs. Again, our reduction is the
first that is tight up to polylog factors.

Abstract: We provide a general framework to improve trade-offs between the number of
full batch and sample queries used to solve structured optimization problems.
Our results apply to a broad class of randomized optimization algorithms that
iteratively solve sub-problems to high accuracy. We show that such algorithms
can be modified to reuse the randomness used to query the input across
sub-problems. Consequently, we improve the trade-off between the number of
gradient (full batch) and individual function (sample) queries for finite sum
minimization, the number of matrix-vector multiplies (full batch) and random
row (sample) queries for top-eigenvector computation, and the number of
matrix-vector multiplies with the transition matrix (full batch) and generative
model (sample) queries for optimizing Markov Decision Processes. To facilitate
our analysis we introduce the notion of pseudo-independent algorithms, a
generalization of pseudo-deterministic algorithms [Gat and Goldwasser 2011],
that quantifies how independent the output of a randomized algorithm is from a
randomness source.

Conclusion: KVComp框架通过创新的有损压缩技术和系统架构的协同设计，有效解决了长上下文推理中的KV缓存内存需求问题，同时保持了高计算效率和模型准确性。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive
potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference
poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the
key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length
and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and
efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that
synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical
inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques
specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful
co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach
maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving
high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves
on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to
existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp
achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing
decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector
multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with
less data movement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询感知服务系统依赖固定级联配置，对所有提示均通过轻量级阶段处理，浪费资源于复杂查询。

Method: HADIS采用基于规则的提示路由器和离线分析阶段生成Pareto最优级联配置表，运行时根据约束选择最佳配置和GPU分配。

Result: HADIS在真实世界轨迹上的评估显示，响应质量提升高达35%，延迟违规率降低2.7-45倍。

Conclusion: HADIS显著提升了响应质量并降低了延迟违规率，相比现有系统表现更优。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual quality but
incur high computational costs, making real-time, scalable deployment
challenging. Existing query-aware serving systems mitigate the cost by
cascading lightweight and heavyweight models, but most rely on a fixed cascade
configuration and route all prompts through an initial lightweight stage,
wasting resources on complex queries. We present HADIS, a hybrid adaptive
diffusion model serving system that jointly optimizes cascade model selection,
query routing, and resource allocation. HADIS employs a rule-based prompt
router to send clearly hard queries directly to heavyweight models, bypassing
the overhead of the lightweight stage. To reduce the complexity of resource
management, HADIS uses an offline profiling phase to produce a Pareto-optimal
cascade configuration table. At runtime, HADIS selects the best cascade
configuration and GPU allocation given latency and workload constraints.
Empirical evaluations on real-world traces demonstrate that HADIS improves
response quality by up to 35% while reducing latency violation rates by
2.7-45$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.

Abstract: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional
units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative
execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to
significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading
(SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical

support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications.
Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we
extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through
Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization.
Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of
dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its
reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving
environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for
dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic
signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free
framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the
variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the
generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to
mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments
demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic
adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency
competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across
diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging
low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic
utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable
component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and
highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation
length adaptation.

Result: Ocior实现：1) 最优弹性（n≥3t+1）；2) 最优通信复杂度（O(n)）；3) 最优计算复杂度（O(n)或O(n log²n)）；4) 最优轮复杂度（两轮异步确认）。

Conclusion: Ocior是一种实用的异步拜占庭容错（BFT）共识协议，在弹性、通信、计算和轮复杂度方面均达到最优性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose Ocior, a practical asynchronous Byzantine
fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol that achieves the optimal performance
in resilience, communication, computation, and round complexity. Unlike
traditional BFT consensus protocols, Ocior processes incoming transactions
individually and concurrently using parallel instances of consensus. While
leader-based consensus protocols rely on a designated leader to propose
transactions, Ocior is a leaderless consensus protocol that guarantees stable
liveness. Ocior achieves: 1) Optimal resilience: Ocior tolerates up to $t$
faulty nodes controlled by an adaptive adversary, for $n\geq 3t+1$. 2) Optimal
communication complexity: The total expected communication per transaction is
$O(n)$. 3) Optimal (or near-optimal) computation complexity: The total
computation per transaction is $O(n)$ in the best case, or $O(n \log^2 n)$ in
the worst case. 4) Optimal round complexity: A legitimate two-party transaction
can be finalized with a good-case latency of two asynchronous rounds, for any
$n\geq 3t+1$. The good case in terms of latency refers to the scenario where
the transaction is proposed by any (not necessarily designated) honest node. A
two-party transaction involves the transfer of digital assets from one user (or
group of users) to one or more recipients. To support efficient consensus, we
introduce a novel non-interactive threshold signature (TS) scheme called
OciorBLSts. It offers fast signature aggregation, and is adaptively secure.
OciorBLSts achieves a signature aggregation computation cost of only $O(n)$ for
the best case. Moreover, OciorBLSts supports the property of Instantaneous TS
Aggregation. This enables real-time aggregation of partial signatures as they
arrive, reducing waiting time and improving responsiveness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种机器学习框架，用于在TON区块链上早期检测rug pull骗局，通过比较两种定义并融合多平台数据，证明梯度提升模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TON区块链的独特架构和庞大的用户基础使其成为欺诈分析的新兴关键环境，早期检测rug pull骗局对投资者保护和生态系统安全至关重要。

Method: 研究采用了梯度提升模型，结合两种不同的rug pull定义（TVL-based和idle-based），在TON上最大的两个DEX（Ston.Fi和DeDust）上进行训练和比较分析。

Result: 梯度提升模型能在交易开始的前五分钟内有效识别rug pull，其中TVL-based方法在AUC上表现更优（高达0.891），而idle-based方法在召回率上表现更好。

Conclusion: 该研究为TON区块链上的DeFi生态系统提供了一个有效的早期欺诈检测机制，强调了模型需要具备平台感知能力以适应不同交易所的数据分布差异。

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning framework for the early detection of
rug pull scams on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within The Open Network (TON)
blockchain. TON's unique architecture, characterized by asynchronous execution
and a massive web2 user base from Telegram, presents a novel and critical
environment for fraud analysis. We conduct a comprehensive study on the two
largest TON DEXs, Ston.Fi and DeDust, fusing data from both platforms to train
our models. A key contribution is the implementation and comparative analysis
of two distinct rug pull definitions--TVL-based (a catastrophic liquidity
withdrawal) and idle-based (a sudden cessation of all trading activity)--within
a single, unified study. We demonstrate that Gradient Boosting models can
effectively identify rug pulls within the first five minutes of trading, with
the TVL-based method achieving superior AUC (up to 0.891) while the idle-based
method excels at recall. Our analysis reveals that while feature sets are
consistent across exchanges, their underlying distributions differ
significantly, challenging straightforward data fusion and highlighting the
need for robust, platform-aware models. This work provides a crucial
early-warning mechanism for investors and enhances the security infrastructure
of the rapidly growing TON DeFi ecosystem.

TL;DR: LobRA通过异构资源分配和负载平衡设计，显著提升了多任务联合微调效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer预训练模型的突破，服务提供商需要降低微调成本，而LoRA技术虽能联合训练多个任务，但受序列长度变化和偏斜影响效率。

Method: LobRA部署了异构资源使用和并行配置的FT副本，并考虑了序列长度偏斜以平衡工作负载。

Result: 实验验证LobRA将联合微调所需的GPU时间减少了45.03%-60.67%。

Conclusion: LobRA框架通过异构资源使用和并行配置，显著减少了联合微调所需的GPU时间，验证了其高效性。

Abstract: With the breakthrough of Transformer-based pre-trained models, the demand for
fine-tuning (FT) to adapt the base pre-trained models to downstream
applications continues to grow, so it is essential for service providers to
reduce the cost of processing FT requests. Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely
used FT technique that only trains small-scale adapters and keeps the base
model unaltered, conveying the possibility of processing multiple FT tasks by
jointly training different LoRA adapters with a shared base model.
  Nevertheless, through in-depth analysis, we reveal the efficiency of joint FT
is dampened by two heterogeneity issues in the training data -- the sequence
length variation and skewness. To tackle these issues, we develop LobRA, a
brand new framework that supports processing multiple FT tasks by jointly
training LoRA adapters. Two innovative designs are introduced. Firstly, LobRA
deploys the FT replicas (i.e., model replicas for FT) with heterogeneous
resource usages and parallel configurations, matching the diverse workloads
caused by the sequence length variation. Secondly, for each training step,
LobRA takes account of the sequence length skewness and dispatches the training
data among the heterogeneous FT replicas to achieve workload balance. We
conduct experiments to assess the performance of LobRA, validating that it
significantly reduces the GPU seconds required for joint FT by 45.03%-60.67%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有W4A8 GEMM内核在实际应用中由于CUDA核心上的去量化效率低下，无法跟上Tensor Cores的高吞吐量，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: LiquidGEMM设计了两种关键技术：LiquidQuant（一种硬件高效的量化方法，支持快速、溢出安全的去量化）和隐式细粒度流水线（无需软件同步或冗余内存流量即可完全重叠权重加载、去量化和MMA操作）。

Result: 实验结果表明，LiquidGEMM比现有W4A8内核快2.90倍，系统级端到端加速比达4.94倍，相比NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM中的量化GEMM内核，性能提升1.12-1.63倍，系统级加速比达1.63倍。

Conclusion: LiquidGEMM是一种硬件高效的W4A8 GEMM内核，通过LiquidQuant和隐式细粒度流水线技术，显著提升了量化GEMM的性能，为高效LLM服务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization is a critical technique for accelerating LLM inference by
reducing memory footprint and improving computational efficiency. Among various
schemes, 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization (W4A8) offers a strong
balance between accuracy and performance. However, existing W4A8 GEMM kernels
fall short in practice due to inefficient dequantization on CUDA Cores, which
cannot keep pace with the high throughput of Tensor Cores. In this paper, we
present LiquidGEMM, a hardware-efficient W4A8 GEMM kernel for efficient LLM
serving. LiquidGEMM designs two key techniques: LiquidQuant, a
hardware-efficient quantization method that enables fast, overflow-safe
dequantization using just two arithmetic instructions per four elements; and an
implicit fine-grained pipeline that fully overlaps weight loading,
dequantization, and MMA across warp groups without software synchronization or
redundant memory traffic. Experimental results show that LiquidGEMM achieves up
to 2.90x speedup over state-of-the-art W4A8 kernels and up to 4.94x end-to-end
system-level speedup. Compared to various quantized GEMM kernels in NVIDIA
TensorRT-LLM, LiquidGEMM delivers 1.12-1.63x performance gains, and achieves up
to 1.63x system-level speedup.

Abstract: We present HiCR, a model to represent the semantics of distributed
heterogeneous applications and runtime systems. The model describes a minimal
set of abstract operations to enable hardware topology discovery, kernel
execution, memory management, communication, and instance management, without
prescribing any implementation decisions. The goal of the model is to enable
execution in current and future systems without the need for significant
refactoring, while also being able to serve any governing parallel programming
paradigm. In terms of software abstraction, HiCR is naturally located between
distributed heterogeneous systems and runtime systems. We coin the phrase
\emph{Runtime Support Layer} for this level of abstraction. We explain how the
model's components and operations are realized by a plugin-based approach that
takes care of device-specific implementation details, and present examples of
HiCR-based applications that operate equally on a diversity of platforms.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的流式压缩框架，支持渐进式解压缩和随机访问解压缩，同时保持高压缩质量和速度。

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression is one of the most efficient solutions to
reduce the volume of scientific data. For lossy compression, progressive
decompression and random-access decompression are critical features that enable
on-demand data access and flexible analysis workflows. However, these features
can severely degrade compression quality and speed. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel streaming compression framework that supports
both progressive decompression and random-access decompression while
maintaining high compression quality and speed. Our contributions are
three-fold: (1) we design the first compression framework that simultaneously
enables both progressive decompression and random-access decompression; (2) we
introduce a hierarchical partitioning strategy to enable both streaming
features, along with a hierarchical prediction mechanism that mitigates the
impact of partitioning and achieves high compression quality -- even comparable
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) non-streaming compressor SZ3; and (3) our framework
delivers high compression and decompression speed, up to 6.7$\times$ faster
than SZ3.

Motivation: 现代云/边缘计算系统中，高效调度并行计算资源是一个核心问题，但现有方法仅适用于特定形式的加速函数，无法处理更一般的凹加速函数。

Method: 本文首先发现了一个广泛适用的最优并行调度规则（CDR规则），并提出了GWF方法来高效计算满足该规则的最优分配。基于这些见解，设计了SmartFill算法。

Result: SmartFill算法在广泛的凹加速函数下显著优于heSRPT，并能对规则函数提供闭式最优解，对非规则函数也能高效计算最优解。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出CDR规则和GWF方法，设计了SmartFill算法，解决了并行作业在一般凹加速函数下的最优调度问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficient scheduling of parallel computation resources across multiple jobs
is a fundamental problem in modern cloud/edge computing systems for many
AI-based applications. Allocating more resources to a job accelerates its
completion, but with diminishing returns. Prior work (heSRPT) solved this
problem only for some specific speedup functions with an exponential form,
providing a closed-form solution. However, the general case with arbitrary
concave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads
-- has remained open.
  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling
algorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first
discover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel
scheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states
that the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs
remains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that
satisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more
general version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.
Combining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the
general scheduling problem. Unlike heSRPT, which always allocates resources to
all active jobs, SmartFill selectively determines which jobs should receive
resources and how much they should be allocated. For a broad class of so-called
\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal
solutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum
with low complexity. Numerical evaluations show that SmartFill can
substantially outperform heSRPT across a wide range of concave speedup
functions.

Conclusion: 通过将二元自旋松弛为连续变量并引入吸引子势函数，本文提出的Ising求解器在多种GPU平台上实现，并在不同规模问题上优于现有求解器。

Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as the task of
finding the ground state of a physical system, such as the Ising model. Most
existing Ising solvers are inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing
techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are
sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose to solve the Ising problem by
relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing a potential
function (attractor) that steers the solution toward binary spin
configurations. The resulting Hamiltonian can be expressed as a difference of
convex functions, enabling the design of efficient iterative algorithms that
require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and are backed by
convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver across a range of GPU
platforms: from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters and
demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem
sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training across
distributed clients while ensuring data privacy. Traditionally, FL relies on a
centralized server to coordinate learning, which creates bottlenecks and a
single point of failure. Decentralized FL architectures eliminate the need for
a central server and can operate in either synchronous or asynchronous modes.
Synchronous FL requires all clients to compute updates and wait for one another
before aggregation, guaranteeing consistency but often suffering from delays
due to slower participants. Asynchronous FL addresses this by allowing clients
to update independently, offering better scalability and responsiveness in
heterogeneous environments.
  Our research develops an asynchronous decentralized FL approach in two
progressive phases. (a) In Phase 1, we develop an asynchronous FL framework
that enables clients to learn and update independently, removing the need for
strict synchronization. (b) In Phase 2, we extend this framework with fault
tolerance mechanisms to handle client failures and message drops, ensuring
robust performance even under unpredictable conditions. As a central
contribution, we propose Client-Confident Convergence and Client-Responsive
Termination novel techniques that provide each client with the ability to
autonomously determine appropriate termination points. These methods ensure
that all active clients conclude meaningfully and efficiently, maintaining
reliable convergence despite the challenges of asynchronous communication and
faults.

Conclusion: 论文提出了两种调度器（单领导者和分布式多领导者），在区块链分片系统中确保了系统稳定性，显著提高了之前已知的最佳结果。

Abstract: In blockchain sharding, $n$ processing nodes are divided into $s$ shards, and
each shard processes transactions in parallel. A key challenge in such a system
is to ensure system stability for any ``tractable'' pattern of generated
transactions; this is modeled by an adversary generating transactions with a
certain rate of at most $\rho$ and burstiness $b$. This model captures
worst-case scenarios and even some attacks on transactions' processing, e.g.,
DoS. A stable system ensures bounded transaction queue sizes and bounded
transaction latency. It is known that the absolute upper bound on the maximum
injection rate for which any scheduler could guarantee bounded queues and
latency of transactions is $\max\left\{ \frac{2}{k+1}, \frac{2}{
\left\lfloor\sqrt{2s}\right\rfloor}\right\}$, where $k$ is the maximum number
of shards that each transaction accesses. Here, we first provide a single
leader scheduler that guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq
\max\left\{ \frac{1}{16k}, \frac{1}{16\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil}\right\}$.
Moreover, we also give a distributed scheduler with multiple leaders that
guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq \frac{1}{16c_1 \log D \log
s}\max\left\{ \frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil} \right\}$, where
$c_1$ is some positive constant and $D$ is the diameter of shard graph $G_s$.
This bound is within a poly-log factor from the optimal injection rate, and
significantly improves the best previous known result for the distributed
setting by Adhikari et al., SPAA 2024.

Abstract: Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In
this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images
with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual
analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively
concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher
resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation
performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,
validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results
demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data
required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in
identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization
of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream
computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of
the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and
load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected
algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a
real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few
minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient

Conclusion: QRMark通过结合QR码的纠错机制和定制化的分块技术，显著提高了水印检测的效率，同时保持了准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Efficient and reliable detection of generated images is critical for the
responsible deployment of generative models. Existing approaches primarily
focus on improving detection accuracy and robustness under various image
transformations and adversarial manipulations, yet they largely overlook the
efficiency challenges of watermark detection across large-scale image
collections. To address this gap, we propose QRMark, an efficient and adaptive
end-to-end method for detecting embedded image watermarks. The core idea of
QRMark is to combine QR Code inspired error correction with tailored tiling
techniques to improve detection efficiency while preserving accuracy and
robustness. At the algorithmic level, QRMark employs a Reed-Solomon error
correction mechanism to mitigate the accuracy degradation introduced by tiling.
At the system level, QRMark implements a resource-aware stream allocation
policy that adaptively assigns more streams to GPU-intensive stages of the
detection pipeline. It further employs a tile-based workload interleaving
strategy to overlap data-loading overhead with computation and schedules
kernels across stages to maximize efficiency. End-to-end evaluations show that
QRMark achieves an average 2.43x inference speedup over the sequential
baseline.

*Avinash Maurya,M. Mustafa Rafique,Franck Cappello,Bogdan Nicolae*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MLP-Offload是一种针对资源受限环境下LLM训练的多级多路径卸载引擎，通过优化I/O瓶颈，显著提升训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM规模增长快于GPU内存，传统多级主机内存或磁盘卸载技术导致显著的I/O开销，影响训练迭代速度。

Method: 设计并实现了MLP-Offload，通过缓存高效和并发控制的方式在多级存储中卸载优化器状态。

Result: 在参数高达280B的模型上，MLP-Offload比现有技术实现了2.5倍的迭代速度提升。

Conclusion: MLP-Offload通过多级、多路径卸载优化器状态，有效缓解了I/O瓶颈，在资源受限的设置下显著提升了LLM训练效率。

Abstract: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is
increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU
memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are
proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write
strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in
the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we
propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine
specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained
setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that
drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update
dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage
tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies
I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload
to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and
concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward
and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that
MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the
state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

TL;DR: eEnergy-Split框架通过分裂学习降低智能农业设备能耗86%，提升准确率6.2%，并优化无人机轨迹以降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能农业系统面临资源有限、数据隐私需求和农村地区连接差等挑战，需要一种高效、隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: 提出了eEnergy-Split框架，利用分裂学习（SL）实现协作模型训练，无需直接数据共享或边缘设备上的繁重计算。通过将模型分布在边缘设备和中央服务器之间，显著降低设备能耗。此外，还提出了最优边缘部署算法和基于旅行商问题（TSP）的无人机轨迹规划策略。

Result: eEnergy-Split相比联邦学习（FL）降低设备能耗高达86%，分类准确率提升6.2%（ResNet-18）。在农业害虫数据集上，整体准确率提升17%，无人机能耗降低。

Conclusion: 结合分裂学习与能源感知设计，为资源受限的智能农业环境提供了一种可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Smart farming systems encounter significant challenges, including limited
resources, the need for data privacy, and poor connectivity in rural areas. To
address these issues, we present eEnergy-Split, an energy-efficient framework
that utilizes split learning (SL) to enable collaborative model training
without direct data sharing or heavy computation on edge devices. By
distributing the model between edge devices and a central server, eEnergy-Split
reduces on-device energy usage by up to 86 percent compared to federated
learning (FL) while safeguarding data privacy. Moreover, SL improves
classification accuracy by up to 6.2 percent over FL on ResNet-18 and by more
modest amounts on GoogleNet and MobileNetV2. We propose an optimal edge
deployment algorithm and a UAV trajectory planning strategy that solves the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exactly to minimize flight cost and extend and
maximize communication rounds. Comprehensive evaluations on agricultural pest
datasets reveal that eEnergy-Split lowers UAV energy consumption compared to
baseline methods and boosts overall accuracy by up to 17 percent. Notably, the
energy efficiency of SL is shown to be model-dependent-yielding substantial
savings in lightweight models like MobileNet, while communication and memory
overheads may reduce efficiency gains in deeper networks. These results
highlight the potential of combining SL with energy-aware design to deliver a
scalable, privacy-preserving solution for resource-constrained smart farming
environments.

Abstract: Satellite Communication (SatCom) networks represent a fundamental pillar in
modern global connectivity, facilitating reliable service and extensive
coverage across a plethora of applications. The expanding demand for
high-bandwidth services and the proliferation of mega satellite constellations

TL;DR: SPLIDT是一种新型数据平面决策树系统，通过分区推理和滑动窗口技术提升模型准确性和可扩展性，支持更多状态特征且保持低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据平面中的决策树实现受限于固定特征集，限制了模型准确性和可扩展性。SPLIDT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPLIDT采用分区推理和滑动窗口技术，结合自定义训练和设计空间探索框架，优化特征分配、树分区和模型深度。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，SPLIDT比现有方法（如NetBeacon和Leo）支持多5倍的状态特征，且保持相同的低检测延迟。

Conclusion: SPLIDT通过创新的分区推理和滑动窗口技术，显著提升了数据平面中决策树的准确性和可扩展性，支持更多状态特征且保持低检测延迟。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being deployed in programmable data
planes (switches and SmartNICs) to enable real-time traffic analysis, security
monitoring, and in-network decision-making. Decision trees (DTs) are
particularly well-suited for these tasks due to their interpretability and
compatibility with data-plane architectures, i.e., match-action tables (MATs).
However, existing in-network DT implementations are constrained by the need to
compute all input features upfront, forcing models to rely on a small, fixed
set of features per flow. This significantly limits model accuracy and
scalability under stringent hardware resource constraints.
  We present SPLIDT, a system that rethinks DT deployment in the data plane by
enabling partitioned inference over sliding windows of packets. SPLIDT
introduces two key innovations: (1) it assigns distinct, variable feature sets
to individual sub-trees of a DT, grouped into partitions, and (2) it leverages
an in-band control channel (via recirculation) to reuse data-plane resources
(both stateful registers and match keys) across partitions at line rate. These
insights allow SPLIDT to scale the number of stateful features a model can use
without exceeding hardware limits. To support this architecture, SPLIDT
incorporates a custom training and design-space exploration (DSE) framework
that jointly optimizes feature allocation, tree partitioning, and DT model
depth. Evaluation across multiple real-world datasets shows that SPLIDT
achieves higher accuracy while supporting up to 5x more stateful features than
prior approaches (e.g., NetBeacon and Leo). It maintains the same low
time-to-detection (TTD) as these systems, while scaling to millions of flows
with minimal recirculation overhead (<0.05%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由方法在跨机构联邦学习中无法有效防止网络拥塞，导致通信延迟增加和训练时间延长。

Method: 提出了基于软件定义网络（SDN）的框架SmartFLow，动态调整路由路径以应对网络条件变化。

Result: 实验结果显示，SmartFLow相比最短路径路由和容量感知路由，分别减少了47%和41%的参数同步时间，并能有效扩展到50个客户端的网络规模。

Conclusion: SmartFLow通过动态调整路由路径，显著减少了跨机构联邦学习中的通信延迟和训练时间，且在实际部署中表现出良好的可扩展性和低计算开销。

Abstract: Cross-silo Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple institutions to
collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving data privacy. In
such settings, clients repeatedly exchange model weights with a central server,
making the overall training time highly sensitive to network performance.
However, conventional routing methods often fail to prevent congestion, leading
to increased communication latency and prolonged training. Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), which provides centralized and programmable control over
network resources, offers a promising way to address this limitation. To this
end, we propose SmartFLow, an SDN-based framework designed to enhance
communication efficiency in cross-silo FL. SmartFLow dynamically adjusts
routing paths in response to changing network conditions, thereby reducing
congestion and improving synchronization efficiency. Experimental results show
that SmartFLow decreases parameter synchronization time by up to 47% compared
to shortest-path routing and 41% compared to capacity-aware routing.
Furthermore, it achieves these gains with minimal computational overhead and
scales effectively to networks of up to 50 clients, demonstrating its
practicality for real-world FL deployments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a robust paradigm for privacy-preserving,
decentralized machine learning. However, a significant gap persists between the
theoretical design of FL algorithms and their practical performance, largely
because existing evaluation tools often fail to model realistic operational
conditions. Many testbeds oversimplify the critical dynamics among algorithmic
efficiency, client-level heterogeneity, and continuously evolving network
infrastructure. To address this challenge, we introduce the Federated Learning
Emulation and Evaluation Testbed (FLEET). This comprehensive platform provides
a scalable and configurable environment by integrating a versatile,
framework-agnostic learning component with a high-fidelity network emulator.
FLEET supports diverse machine learning frameworks, customizable real-world
network topologies, and dynamic background traffic generation. The testbed
collects holistic metrics that correlate algorithmic outcomes with detailed
network statistics. By unifying the entire experiment configuration, FLEET
enables researchers to systematically investigate how network constraints, such
as limited bandwidth, high latency, and packet loss, affect the convergence and
efficiency of FL algorithms. This work provides the research community with a
robust tool to bridge the gap between algorithmic theory and real-world network
conditions, promoting the holistic and reproducible evaluation of federated
learning systems.

Conclusion: 该论文的无监督框架在加密移动流量分类中表现出色，仅比手动清理方法降低了2%~2.5%的准确率，为基于机器学习的加密流量分类提供了高效且有效的预处理步骤。

Abstract: Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined
categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With
the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in
mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional
methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted
traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular
Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted
traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is
traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training
(e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and
long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection
of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In
this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans
encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our
framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared
with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an
efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic
classification.

TL;DR: ReWeave是一种可扩展的链路级TE方案，通过局部化重路由和SRv6绕行技术，显著提升链路故障恢复性能，优于现有方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISP网络中链路故障频发，现有TE方案要么性能下降，要么开销大且扩展性差，因此需要一种高效且可扩展的故障恢复机制。

Method: ReWeave通过为每条链路配备紧凑的相邻备份路径，实现局部化重路由，利用SRv6绕行技术动态调整流量，无需控制器干预或全路径重新计算。

Result: 在大规模骨干网络上的评估显示，ReWeave在链路故障场景下优于现有方案，最大链路利用率降低10.5%~20.1%，最坏情况利用率降低29.5%~40.9%，且响应速度与最快的本地重路由方案相当。

Conclusion: ReWeave在链路故障恢复方面表现优于现有TE方案，显著降低了链路利用率并保持了快速响应能力。

Abstract: Link failures occur frequently in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks
and pose significant challenges for Traffic Engineering (TE). Existing TE
schemes either reroute traffic over vulnerable static paths, leading to
performance degradation, or precompute backup routes for a broad range of
failure scenarios, which introduces high overhead and limits scalability.
Hence, an effective failure recovery mechanism is required to offer sufficient
path diversity under constrained overhead, thereby ensuring robust and
performant network operation. This paper presents ReWeave, a scalable and
efficient link-level TE scheme that enables localized rerouting by equipping
each link with a compact set of adjacent-only backup paths. Upon detecting a
failure, only the routers at both ends of the failed link reroute traffic
dynamically using SRv6-based detours, without controller intervention or
full-path recomputation. Evaluation results on large-scale backbone networks
demonstrate that ReWeave outperforms existing TE schemes in link failure
scenarios. Compared to HARP, the state-of-the-art failure recovery scheme based
on centralized control and dynamic traffic reallocation, our approach reduces
the average maximum link utilization by 10.5%~20.1%, and lowers the worst-case
utilization by 29.5%~40.9%. When compared with Flexile, a protection-based
scheme that precomputes routes for multi-failure scenarios, ReWeave achieves a
similarly low packet loss rate in 90% of failure cases, while maintaining a
response speed comparable to the fastest router-based local rerouting schemes.

Abstract: The multichannel rendezvous problem (MRP) is a critical challenge for
neighbor discovery in IoT applications, requiring two users to find each other
by hopping among available channels over time. This paper addresses the MRP in
scenarios where a global channel enumeration system is unavailable. To tackle
this challenge, we propose a suite of low-complexity multichannel rendezvous
algorithms based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), tailored for environments
where channel labels are unique L-bit identifiers rather than globally
coordinated indices. Inspired by consistent hashing techniques in distributed
systems, we develop the LC-LSH and LC-LSH4 algorithms for synchronous and
asynchronous settings, respectively. These algorithms significantly reduce
implementation complexity while maintaining expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR)
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that require global channel
enumeration. To ensure bounded maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) in the
asynchronous setting, we further introduce the ASYM-LC-LSH4 and QR-LC-LSH4
algorithms by embedding multiset-enhanced modular clock and quasi-random
techniques into our framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LSH
algorithms in both synchronous and asynchronous settings, even without a global
channel enumeration system.

Abstract: This work explores the integration of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and
Quantum-Inspired (QI) techniques for optimizing end-to-end (E2E) network
services in telecommunication systems, particularly focusing on 5G networks and
beyond. The application of QML and QI algorithms is investigated, comparing
their performance with classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The present
study employs a hybrid framework combining quantum and classical computing
leveraging the strengths of QML and QI, without the penalty of quantum hardware
availability. This is particularized for the optimization of the Quality of
Experience (QoE) over cellular networks. The framework comprises an estimator
for obtaining the expected QoE based on user metrics, service settings, and
cell configuration, and an optimizer that uses the estimation to choose the
best cell and service configuration. Although the approach is applicable to any
QoE-based network management, its implementation is particularized for the
optimization of network configurations for Cloud Gaming services. Then, it is
evaluated via performance metrics such as accuracy and model loading and
inference times for the estimator, and time to solution and solution score for
the optimizer. The results indicate that QML models achieve similar or superior
accuracy to classical ML models for estimation, while decreasing inference and
loading times. Furthermore, potential for better performance is observed for
higher-dimensional data, highlighting promising results for higher complexity
problems. Thus, the results demonstrate the promising potential of QML in
advancing network optimization, although challenges related to data
availability and integration complexities between quantum and classical ML are
identified as future research lines.

Result: 模拟结果表明，EPSR协议几乎将PSR的通信成本减半，同时保持相同的时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 本文提出的增强分区集合协调（EPSR）方案在保持与PSR相同的时间和通信轮次复杂度的同时，显著降低了通信开销。

Abstract: In this work, a set reconciliation setting is considered in which two parties
have similar sets that they would like to reconcile. In particular, we focus on
a divide-and-conquer strategy known as partitioned set reconciliation (PSR), in
which the sets to be reconciled are successively partitioned until they contain
a number of differences below some predetermined value. Borrowing techniques
from tree-algorithms for random-access protocols, we present and analyze a
novel set reconciliation scheme that we term enhanced partitioned set
reconciliation (EPSR). This approach improves the efficiency in terms of
overhead, i.e., it yields a lower communication cost, while keeping the same
time and communication round complexity as PSR. Additionally, we simulate the
performance of the proposed algorithm in an event-driven simulator. Our
findings indicate that this novel protocol nearly halves the communication cost
of PSR while maintaining the same time complexity.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一套新颖的马尔可夫链（MC）模型，用于准确建模Wi-Fi 7的多链路操作（MLO），并通过ns-3仿真验证了模型的准确性，揭示了Wi-Fi 7与旧版Wi-Fi共存场景的动态特性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi 7 introduces Multi-link operation (MLO) to enhance throughput and
latency performance compared to legacy Wi-Fi standards. MLO enables
simultaneous transmission and reception through multiple links, departing from
conventional single-link operations (SLO). To fully exploit MLO's potential, it
is essential to investigate Wi-Fi 7's coexistence performance with legacy Wi-Fi
devices. Existing approaches, however, have overlooked some crucial aspects of
MLO, necessitating the development of a standards-compliant analytical
framework to model the actual channel access mechanism of MLO. Therefore, this
paper tries to fill the gap by proposing a set of novel Markov chains (MC) to
accurately model the MLO operation aligned with multi-link backoff behaviors
specified by the standard. Specifically, we design two separate MCs for AP and
non-AP multi-link devices (MLD) respectively, based on which transmit and
collision probabilities are derived under the saturated traffic condition.
Then, we also derive closed-form expressions for the throughput of various
device types in the coexistence scenario between Wi-Fi 7 and legacy Wi-Fi,
including AP MLD, non- AP MLD, and legacy devices. To validate the accuracy of
our proposed models, we developed an ns-3 based simulator by implementing both
STR(simultaneous transmission and reception) and NSTR(non-STR) based MLO
operations. Our ns-3 based extensive simulations have demonstrated that the
proposed analytic model provides accurate estimates on the per device
throughput performance, while also revealing the dynamics of inter-WLAN
coexistence scenarios.

using OpenAirInterface5G and Open5GS is built on Kubernetes, as well as the
system's functionality is demonstrated via a network traffic prediction case

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AAV辅助数据传输受限于有限通信覆盖范围，需周期性返航中继，导致延迟峰值和AoI上升。本文旨在通过分布式波束成形和优化算法解决这些问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于分布式波束成形的AAV辅助转发系统，并采用深度强化学习（结合时序输入、层归一化门控循环单元和压缩-激励块）来优化AAV轨迹和通信调度，以最小化AoI和能耗。

Conclusion: 论文提出的SAC-TLS算法在收敛性、时间平均AoI和AAV能耗方面优于基线算法，验证了分布式波束成形和深度强化学习在提升IoT网络信息时效性方面的有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of low-altitude wireless networking, autonomous
aerial vehicles (AAVs) have emerged as critical enablers for timely and
reliable data delivery, particularly in remote or underserved areas. In this
context, the age of information (AoI) has emerged as a critical performance
metric for evaluating the freshness and timeliness of transmitted information
in Internet of things (IoT) networks. However, conventional AAV-assisted data
transmission is fundamentally limited by finite communication coverage ranges,
which requires periodic return flights for data relay operations. This
propulsion-repositioning cycle inevitably introduces latency spikes that raise
the AoI while degrading service reliability. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a AAV-assisted forwarding system based on distributed
beamforming to enhance the AoI in IoT. Specifically, AAVs collaborate via
distributed beamforming to collect and relay data between the sensor nodes and
remote base station. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the
AoI and AAV energy consumption, by jointly optimizing the AAV trajectories and
communication schedules. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem and its
pronounced temporal variability, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning
solution that incorporates temporal sequence input, layer normalization gated
recurrent unit, and a squeeze-and-excitation block to capture long-term
dependencies, thereby improving decision-making stability and accuracy, and
reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed SAC-TLS algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of
convergence, time average AoI, and energy consumption of AAVs.

Abstract: We propose a framework for resource provisioning with QoS guarantees in

probabilistic service guarantees for throughput and delay. Key to our approach
is a Modified Dirft-plus-Penalty (MDP) policy that ensures long-term stability
while capturing short-term probabilistic service guarantees using linearized
upper-confidence bounds. We characterize the feasible region of service
guarantees and show that our MDP procedure achieves mean rate stability and an
optimality gap that vanishes with the frame size over which service guarantees
are provided. Finally, empirical simulations validate our theory and
demonstrate the favorable performance of our algorithm in handling QoS in
multi-infrastructure networks.

Abstract: The transformation of 5G networks into software-defined, agile, intelligent
and programmable architectures necessitates a paradigm shift in deployment
strategies. To deliver superior performance and surpass traditional systems,
public and private 5G networks must adopt software-centric cloud native
frameworks that enable flexibility through tailored configurations and
optimized deployment approaches. In Singapore, the Infocomm Media Development
Authority (IMDA) and the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF) launched
the Future Communications Research and Development Programme (FCP) to advance
the nation's communications and connectivity landscape. At the core of this
initiative is the Future Communications Translation Lab (FCT) at the Singapore
Institute of Technology (SIT), which focuses on advancing 5G technologies to
higher readiness levels, facilitating their adoption across various industries.
A key component is the deployment of FCT O-RAN, a state-of-the-art multi-vendor
private 5G platform. The setup includes a 5G core network powered by Microsoft
Affirmed and ENEA, O-RAN Centralized and Distributed Units from Radisys. Indoor
Remote Units are deployed with Foxconn, while outdoor RUs are deployed with
Benetel. To optimize the deployment of remote units, a digital twin was created
using Wireless InSite, and performance evaluations were conducted for both the
digital twin and the private 5G deployment. Smartphones equipped with QualiPoc
were used to measure network performance. The testbed demonstrated effective
performance with optimized bandwidth allocations for both indoor and outdoor
environments. In the indoor setup, utilizing 50 MHz of bandwidth, a downlink
throughput of 713 Mbps and an uplink throughput of 66 Mbps were achieved.
Meanwhile, the outdoor setup, utilizing 40 MHz of bandwidth, achieved a
downlink throughput of 371 Mbps and an uplink throughput of 55 Mbps.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于实时AI吞吐量估计的自适应ML分割方案，显著提升了在隐私保护图像处理中的性能，包括端到端延迟、能耗和隐私保护。

Abstract: Mobile devices increasingly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for complex
inference tasks, but running entire models locally drains the device battery
quickly. Offloading computation entirely to cloud or edge servers reduces
processing load at devices but poses privacy risks and can incur high network
bandwidth consumption and long delays. Split computing (SC) mitigates these
challenges by partitioning DNNs between user equipment (UE) and edge servers.
However, 5G wireless channels are time-varying and a fixed splitting scheme can
lead to sub-optimal solutions. This paper addresses the limitations of fixed
model partitioning in privacy-focused image processing and explores trade-offs
in key performance metrics, including end-to-end (E2E) latency, energy
consumption, and privacy, by developing an adaptive ML partitioning scheme
based on real-time AI-powered throughput estimation. Evaluation in multiple
scenarios demonstrates significant performance gains of our scheme.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于AoI的信号无关调度策略，通过近似惩罚函数解决多源相关RMAB问题，仿真显示其有效性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于通信资源有限，多源相关且观测数据可能不新鲜，传统RMAB（不安定多臂老虎机）方法无法直接应用。因此，需要设计一种新的调度策略以最小化推断误差。

Method: 论文提出了一种信号无关的调度策略，利用AoI（信息年龄）指标，无需了解实际目标值或源观测数据。针对惩罚函数不可分的问题，通过近似处理并建立误差分析边界，开发了两种调度策略：已知惩罚函数情况下的策略和未知惩罚函数情况下的在线学习策略（MGF策略）。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的策略在最小化推断误差和可扩展性方面表现优异。对于已知惩罚函数的情况，策略在渐近状态下有最优性上界；对于未知情况，在线学习策略（MGF）通过反馈学习有效工作。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新颖的调度策略，通过近似惩罚函数并建立误差分析边界，有效解决了多源相关情况下的实时远程推断问题。仿真结果表明，所提出的策略在最小化推断误差和可扩展性方面表现优异。

Abstract: We investigate a real-time remote inference system where multiple correlated
sources transmit observations over a communication channel to a receiver. The
receiver utilizes these observations to infer multiple time-varying targets.
Due to limited communication resources, the delivered observations may not be
fresh. To quantify data freshness, we employ the Age of Information (AoI)
metric. To minimize the inference error, we aim to design a signal-agnostic
scheduling policy that leverages AoI without requiring knowledge of the actual
target values or the source observations. This scheduling problem is a restless
multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with a non-separable penalty function. Unlike
traditional RMABs, the correlation among sources introduces a unique challenge:
the penalty function of each source depends on the AoI of other correlated
sources, preventing decomposition of the problem into multiple independent
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a key step in applying traditional RMAB
solutions. To address this, we propose a novel approach by approximating the
penalty function of each source and establish an analytical bound on the
approximation error. We then develop scheduling policies for two scenarios: (i)
full knowledge of the penalty functions and (ii) no knowledge of the penalty
functions. For the case of known penalty functions, we present an upper bound
on the optimality gap of our policy in the asymptotic regime. For the case of
unknown penalty functions and signal distributions, we develop an online
learning approach that utilizes bandit feedback to learn an online Maximum Gain
First (MGF) policy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed policies in minimizing inference error and achieving scalability in
the number of sources.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generalized
intelligence, multimodal understanding, and adaptive learning across a wide
range of domains. However, their deployment in harsh or austere environments --
characterized by intermittent connectivity, limited computation, noisy data,
and dynamically changing network topologies -- remains an open challenge.
Existing distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) struggle
to adapt in such settings due to their reliance on stable infrastructure,
synchronized updates, and resource-intensive training. In this work, we explore
the potential of Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) as a promising paradigm to
address these limitations. By integrating the scalability and generalization
power of FMs with novel decentralized, communication-aware FL frameworks, we
aim to enable robust, energy-efficient, and adaptive intelligence in extreme

constraints in harsh environments, and discuss the open research challenges in
communication design, model robustness, and energy-efficient personalization
for these unique settings.

Abstract: The escalating demands of immersive communications, alongside advances in
network softwarization and AI-driven cognition and generative reasoning, create
a pivotal opportunity to rethink and reshape the future Internet. In this
context, we introduce in this paper, FlexNGIA 2.0, an Agentic AI-driven
Internet architecture that leverages LLM-based AI agents to autonomously
orchestrate, configure, and evolve the network. These agents can, at runtime,
perceive, reason, coordinate among themselves to dynamically design, implement,
deploy, and adapt communication protocols, Service Function Chains (SFCs),
network functions, resource allocation strategies, congestion control, and
traffic engineering schemes, thereby ensuring optimal performance, reliability,
and efficiency under evolving conditions.
  The paper first outlines the overall architecture of FlexNGIA 2.0 and its
constituent LLM-Based AI agents. For each agent, we detail its design,
implementation, inputs and outputs, prompt structures, interactions with tools
and other agents, followed by preliminary proof-of-concept experiments
demonstrating its operation and potential. The results clearly highlight the
ability of these LLM-based AI agents to automate the design, the
implementation, the deployment, and the performance evaluation of transport
protocols, service function chains, network functions, congestion control
schemes, and resource allocation strategies.
  FlexNGIA 2.0 paves the way for a new class of Agentic AI-Driven networks,
where fully cognitive, self-evolving AI agents can autonomously design,
implement, adapt and optimize the network's protocols, algorithms, and
behaviors to efficiently operate across complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous
environments. To bring this vision to reality, we also identify key research
challenges toward achieving fully autonomous, adaptive, and agentic AI-driven

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations demand routing that
simultaneously minimizes energy, guarantees delivery under congestion, and
meets latency requirements for time-critical flows. We present a segment
routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists
of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a
high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128).
The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that
combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end
latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined
network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of
Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing
schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a
PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms
between Ottawa and Vancouver. The results confirm Flex-Algo's value as a

Abstract: The rapid development of AI agents leads to a surge in communication demands.
Alongside this rise, a variety of frameworks and protocols emerge. While these
efforts demonstrate the vitality of the field, they also highlight increasing
fragmentation, with redundant innovation and siloed designs hindering
cross-domain interoperability. These challenges underscore the need for a
systematic perspective to guide the development of scalable, secure, and
sustainable AI agent ecosystems. To address this need, this paper provides the
first systematic analysis of AI agent communication from the standpoint of
Internet architecture-the most successful global-scale distributed system in
history. Specifically, we distill decades of Internet evolution into five key
elements that are directly relevant to agent communication: scalability,
security, real-time performance, high performance, and manageability. We then
use these elements to examine both the opportunities and the bottlenecks in
developing robust multi-agent ecosystems. Overall, this paper bridges Internet
architecture and AI agent communication for the first time, providing a new
lens for guiding the sustainable growth of AI agent communication ecosystems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first ever fully open-source implementation of Load
Balancing (LB) in an experimental Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR)
Standalone (SA) network using Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture.
The deployment leverages the O-RAN Software Community (SC) Near Real-Time RAN
Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC), srsRAN stack, Open5GS core, and
Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) User
Equipments (UEs). The implementation extends the srsRAN stack to support E2
Service Model for RAN Control (E2SM-RC) Style 3 Action 1 to facilitate
Handovers (HOs) and adds Medium Access Control (MAC) downlink (DL) buffer
volume reporting to srsRAN's E2 Service Model for Key Performance Measurement
(E2SM-KPM). The deployment demonstrates Near-RT RIC closed-loop control where
our Mobility Load Balancing (MLB) xApp makes HO decisions based on network load
metrics for LB between two Open Distributed Units (O-DUs) operating at
different frequencies in the same band.

TL;DR: 论文提出统一孪生转换（UTT）框架，优化网络数字孪生（NDTs）的互操作性，通过多模态和分布式映射机制降低创建成本并提升效率，验证了其在多种任务中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建精确的NDTs面临数据源整合、属性映射和可扩展性等挑战，而现有工作主要关注从零开始创建NDTs，缺乏对互操作性的研究。

Method: 通过联合多模态和分布式映射机制，UTT框架探索了NDTs内部和之间的互操作，包括转移、合并和拆分，以创建任务导向的孪生。

Result: 在真实世界的孪生辅助应用（如轨迹重建、人体定位和感官数据生成）中，UTT框架展示了NDTs互操作性的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 网络数字孪生（NDTs）在统一孪生转换（UTT）框架下的互操作性为任务导向的孪生创建提供了高效的计算范式，优化了资源利用率并降低了创建成本，同时确保了模型一致性。

Abstract: The integration of digital twinning technologies is driving next-generation
networks toward new capabilities, allowing operators to thoroughly understand
network conditions, efficiently analyze valuable radio data, and innovate
applications through user-friendly, immersive interfaces. Building on this
foundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational
processes and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive
management through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing
precise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,
mapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining
scalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on
the creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and
inter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)
framework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,
merging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging
joint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource
utilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model
consistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is
conducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated
aggregation process. Evaluations on real-world twin-assisted applications, such
as trajectory reconstruction, human localization, and sensory data generation,
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of interoperability among NDTs
for corresponding task development.

TL;DR: AdaptCache通过动态压缩优化KV缓存，显著减少加载延迟并提升DRAM命中率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型应用中重复使用上下文导致冗余计算，现有系统因KV缓存存储在DRAM和SSD中而面临高加载延迟问题。

Method: 设计了一个动态决策系统，用于选择KV缓存条目的压缩算法、压缩率和设备放置，以优化DRAM命中率和减少加载延迟。

Result: 与静态压缩基线相比，AdaptCache在相同质量下实现了1.43-2.4倍的延迟节省，在相同延迟下提升了6-55%的质量。

Conclusion: AdaptCache系统通过动态决策KV缓存的压缩算法、压缩率和设备放置，显著提升了DRAM命中率并减少了加载延迟，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed
context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant
redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant
computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the
corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these
LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large
and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.
  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high
loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To
increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression
as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the
compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache
entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly
degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines
across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at
the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

Conclusion: 通过构建知识图谱和提出Insights-on-Graph框架，研究表明IOG在火灾风险检测和救援决策中具有良好的适用性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical
application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world
deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks,
requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and
adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first
large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first
scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop
verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous
collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120
hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames.
This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and
airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the
customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes,
and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to
collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify
algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for
wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过无对应标记的学习框架，实现了从模拟到现实的无缝转换，适用于多种视觉设备和软机器人控制。

Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real
learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike
traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points
with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation
function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network
-- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the
sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as
point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker
points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be
seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for
inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and
adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically
actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft
manipulators.

Motivation: 钢筋绑扎是钢筋混凝土施工中的重复性关键任务，通常由人工完成，存在较高的工效学风险。尽管机器人操控技术进步显著，但在复杂钢筋节点中准确估计绑扎姿态仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Motivation: 自动车辆定位（AVL）数据提供了对交通动态的洞察，但其有效性常因更新频率不一致而受到限制，需要进行轨迹重建。

Method: 本研究评估了13种轨迹重建方法，包括几种新颖方法，使用来自德克萨斯州奥斯汀的高分辨率AVL数据。研究考察了速度、位置、平滑和数据密度四个关键因素对重建性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，速度感知方法始终优于仅基于位置的方法。在复杂、拥堵的城市环境中，基于平滑的方法可能会降低整体性能，尽管保持单调性仍然至关重要。VCHIP-ME方法在精度和效率之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究强调了投资于更高频率的AVL数据收集以改进分析的重要性，并提供了实施轨迹重建系统的实用指南。VCHIP-ME方法在高精度和计算效率之间取得了平衡，适用于历史分析和实时应用。

Abstract: Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics,
but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies,
necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory
reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using
high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four
critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on
reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of
these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the
trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework
combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity
with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning
velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed
variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each
method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our
findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform
position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based
methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban
environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity
constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)
yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both
historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant
predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer
practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory
reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in
higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态机器人任务中，机器人无法从失败中恢复或重试，因此需要准确识别物体的物理属性以实现成功执行。

Method: 提出了一种基于强化学习的任务驱动探索方法，通过特权任务策略对估计属性误差的敏感性自动生成奖励，训练探索策略。同时引入基于不确定性的机制，决定何时从探索过渡到任务执行。

Result: 方法在击打任务中达到90%的成功率，平均探索时间低于1.2秒，显著优于基线方法（最高40%成功率或需要低效的模拟器查询和重训练）。任务驱动奖励还成功应用于经典CartPole示例。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态机器人任务中表现出色，成功率达到90%，且探索时间短于1.2秒，显著优于基线方法。此外，任务驱动的奖励机制能有效捕捉物理属性的相对重要性，并在实际机器人臂（KUKA iiwa）上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside the
reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical
properties of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to
recover from failure or retry without human intervention. To address this
challenge, we propose a task-informed exploration approach, based on
reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration policy using rewards
automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged task policy to
errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based
mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution,
ensuring sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time.
Our method achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average
exploration time under 1.2 seconds, significantly outperforming baselines that
achieve at most 40% success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a
simulator at test time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed
rewards capture the relative importance of physical properties in both the
striking task and the classical CartPole example. Finally, we validate our
approach by demonstrating its ability to identify object properties and adjust
task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管基于梯度的方法在性能上优于无导数方法，但由于实现成本或不可用性，获取模拟器梯度通常不切实际。基于模型的强化学习（MBRL）可以通过学习动力学模型来近似这些梯度，但训练过程中的预测误差累积会降低策略性能。

Method: 提出了一种将轨迹生成与梯度计算解耦的方法：轨迹通过模拟器展开，而梯度则通过学习的可微分模拟器模型的反向传播计算。

Result: 该方法实现了与SHAC等专用优化器相当的样本效率和速度，同时保持了PPO等标准方法的通用性，避免了其他一阶MBRL方法中观察到的不良行为。

Conclusion: 该方法在基准控制任务上进行了实证验证，并在真实的Go2四足机器人上展示了其有效性，涵盖了四足和双足运动任务。

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

Motivation: 机器人经常遇到视觉模糊的对象，其操作结果在物理交互前无法确定。现有生成模型在模糊情况下表现不佳，即使考虑了动作历史。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的History-Aware VErifier（HAVE），通过解耦动作生成与验证，利用无条件扩散生成器生成多个候选动作，并通过历史感知验证器选择最优动作。

Conclusion: 通过理论和实证评估，证明了HAVE方法在多种模拟和现实环境中优于基线方法，显著提高了动作质量。

Abstract: We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain
scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter
visually ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until
physically interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically
adapt to such ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in
ambiguous cases, even when conditioned on action history. To address this, we
propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an
unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions
and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by
reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality.
Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world
environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven
object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over
baselines. Our project website is available at:

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间环境中的机器人自主性面临高不确定性、严格运动约束和有限人工干预机会，急需一种能整合任务与运动规划的方法。

Method: 基于AND/OR图扩展的TMP-EAOG框架，将任务抽象编码为图结构，并在执行过程中迭代扩展，同时进行运动规划可行性评估。

Result: TMP-EAOG在模拟移动机械臂的基准测试中表现出色，能够处理多种挑战，具备鲁棒性、可控性和有限灵活性。

Conclusion: TMP-EAOG框架通过AND/OR图的扩展和实时运动规划评估，展现了在空间环境中处理不确定性和严格约束的潜力，适用于多种自主任务场景。

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于深度强化学习的接触辅助导航策略，显著提高了柔性机器人内窥镜在动态胃环境中的导航精度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态胃环境中导航柔性机器人内窥镜具有挑战性，需要有效利用与胃壁的接触力来达到目标位置。

Method: 采用基于物理的有限元方法模拟可变形的胃环境，并利用近端策略优化算法进行训练。

Result: 在静态和动态胃环境中，CAN策略实现了100%的成功率和1.6毫米的平均误差，在具有更强外部干扰的未见场景中保持了85%的成功率。

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的接触辅助导航策略显著提高了柔性机器人内窥镜在动态胃环境中的导航性能。

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种通过操控VLA模型内部表示实现零样本控制的方法，验证了其在仿真和物理机器人上的有效性，为透明和可操控的基础模型提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在解释和操控方面远不及基于显式运动学和动力学模型的传统机器人流程，这限制了学习策略在现实机器人应用中的稳健性和可解释性。

Method: 通过将transformer层的feedforward激活投影到token嵌入基上，识别与动作选择因果关联的稀疏语义方向，并引入一种无需微调、奖励信号或环境交互的实时激活引导方法。

Result: 在两个开源VLA模型（Pi0和OpenVLA）上评估了该方法，并在仿真（LIBERO）和物理机器人（UR5）上实现了零样本行为控制。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了如何通过解释和操控VLA模型的内部表示来实现对行为的零样本控制，为机器人学中的透明和可操控基础模型建立了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

TL;DR: JEDP-RL框架通过分阶段雅可比估计和政策执行，显著提升了DCRs的规划效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于非线性变形力学和部分状态可观测性，可变形连续体机器人（DCRs）的规划挑战了传统强化学习方法的马尔可夫假设。

Method: 提出了Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL)框架，将规划分解为分阶段的雅可比估计和政策执行。

Result: 在SOFA手术动态模拟中，JEDP-RL相比PPO基线表现出更快的收敛速度、更高的导航效率和更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: JEDP-RL框架通过分阶段的雅可比估计和政策执行，显著提高了DCRs的规划效率、导航效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

diverse material properties such as size, shape, and lithology. To address
these limitations, this study presents a computer vision-aided robotic arm
system designed for autonomous aggregate sorting in construction and mining

binocular stereo camera for 3D perception, and a ROS-based control framework.
Core techniques include an attention-augmented YOLOv8 model for aggregate
detection, stereo matching for 3D localization, Denavit-Hartenberg kinematic
modeling for arm motion control, minimum enclosing rectangle analysis for size
estimation, and hand-eye calibration for precise coordinate alignment.
Experimental validation with four aggregate types achieved an average grasping
and sorting success rate of 97.5%, with comparable classification accuracy.
Remaining challenges include the reliable handling of small aggregates and
texture-based misclassification. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates
significant potential to enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and
improve safety in aggregate handling, while providing a scalable framework for
advancing smart automation in construction, mining, and recycling industries.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that can
generalize across diverse tasks while maintaining robust and reliable
performance. We introduce {GVF-TAPE}, a closed-loop framework that combines
generative visual foresight with task-agnostic pose estimation to enable
scalable robotic manipulation. GVF-TAPE employs a generative video model to
predict future RGB-D frames from a single side-view RGB image and a task
description, offering visual plans that guide robot actions. A decoupled pose
estimation model then extracts end-effector poses from the predicted frames,
translating them into executable commands via low-level controllers. By
iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop,
GVF-TAPE achieves real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of
tasks. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach reduces reliance on task-specific action data and
generalizes effectively, providing a practical and scalable solution for
intelligent robotic systems.

long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can
robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex,

Abstract: This paper presents two types of extended diffeomorphism designs to
compensate for spatial placement differences between robot workspaces.
Teleoperation of multiple robots is attracting attention to expand the
utilization of the robot embodiment. Real-time reproduction of robot motion
would facilitate the efficient execution of similar tasks by multiple robots. A
challenge in the motion reproduction is compensating for the spatial
arrangement errors of target keypoints in robot workspaces. This paper proposes
a methodology for smooth mappings that transform primary robot poses into
follower robot poses based on the predefined key points in each workspace.
Through a picking task experiment using a dual-arm UR5 robot, this study
demonstrates that the proposed mapping generation method can balance lower
mapping errors for precise operation and lower mapping gradients for smooth
replicated movement.

types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000
TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset averages two vehicle conflicts
per minute, involving roughly 25% of all motor vehicles. FLUID provides
comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw

Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control
of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers
from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability
guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL
agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample
efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an
optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using
only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some
controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges,
ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also
applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The
controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot
simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a
conventional kinematic controller.

free-roaming, ground-based filming robot. Expert trajectories are collected via
joystick teleoperation in simulation, capturing smooth, expressive motion
without explicit objective design.
  Trained exclusively on these demonstrations, our GAIL policy outperforms a
PPO baseline in simulation, achieving higher rewards, faster convergence, and
lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a
prior TD3-based method. These results show that LfD offers a robust,
reward-free alternative to RL in cinematic domains, enabling real-time
deployment with minimal technical effort. Our pipeline brings intuitive,
stylized camera control within reach of creative professionals, bridging the
gap between artistic intent and robotic autonomy.

Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of
robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments.
All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired
with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and
evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework
that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for fine-grained execution. G0 is trained
using a three-stage curriculum: cross-embodiment pre-training,
single-embodiment pre-training, and task-specific post-training. A
comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and
long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, we find that the single-embodiment pre-training stage,
together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent
years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This
paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and
efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method
integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into
the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively
maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The
framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and
HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC
computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the
closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware
trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations
conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,
and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as
quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that
the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth
transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work
bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning
approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications.

Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field
to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of
current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which
largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of
VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the
lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous
vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the
absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU
safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving,
particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year
project, we focused on applying the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method
to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate safety functions for Vulnerable Road

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety,
stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory
planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high
computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited
validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose
an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i)
a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly
balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this
cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of
desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed
framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a
dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is
based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and
sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The
sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the
proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives,
providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization
methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of
scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) field has traditionally used Wizard-of-Oz
(WoZ) controlled robots to explore navigation, conversational dynamics,
human-in-the-loop interactions, and more to explore appropriate robot behaviors
in everyday settings. However, existing WoZ tools are often limited to one
context, making them less adaptable across different settings, users, and
robotic platforms. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Context-Adaptable
Robot Interface System (CARIS) that combines advanced robotic capabilities such
teleoperation, human perception, human-robot dialogue, and multimodal data
recording. Through pilot studies, we demonstrate the potential of CARIS to WoZ
control a robot in two contexts: 1) mental health companion and as a 2) tour
guide. Furthermore, we identified areas of improvement for CARIS, including
smoother integration between movement and communication, clearer functionality
separation, recommended prompts, and one-click communication options to enhance
the usability wizard control of CARIS. This project offers a publicly

real-time, resource-efficient visual SLAM system designed to address the
challenges of localization and photorealistic mapping in environments with
dynamic objects. Specifically, the proposed system integrates prior image

misjudgment. Additionally, to enhance constraints for optimization after
removing dynamic obstacles, we devise adaptive feature extraction strategies
significantly improving the system's resilience. Experiments conducted on
publicly dynamic RGB-D datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation and dense map
reconstruction, while operating in real-time in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a
specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer
algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive
rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse
kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We
extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of
two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF
manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is
expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is
solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of
the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive
calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is shown by experiments.

Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a
6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the
motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we
are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector
should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse
kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The
proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible
region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector.
Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint
configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the
specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to
the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by
reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying
Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by
experiments.

Conclusion: 提出的CDF-MPPI框架在机器人运动规划中表现出高效性和有效性，显著提升了成功率和控制频率。

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in
robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients
of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.
However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the
SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have
been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration
space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and
thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free
approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage
long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these
methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory
samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost
functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a
framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the
robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost
in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting
computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate
that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and
consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator
simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control
frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both
optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for
high-dimensional motion planning.

data is employed for style calibration and empirical validation. Experimental
results demonstrate zero collisions across six style combinations, two

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合任务空间速度场和关节空间二次规划（QP），实现了高自由度夹爪的快速、反应性抓取，能够在动态环境中实时执行无碰撞运动。

Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that
combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP)
in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is
particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in
state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of
the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we
plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions,
and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This
approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space
coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a
weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields
with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with
privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking
algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand
systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to
dynamic environments and external disturbances.

Conclusion: 该研究通过FPE-MPC方法成功解决了软机器人因高度不确定性和非线性运动带来的控制挑战，验证了其在软机器人控制中的有效性。

Abstract: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as
enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also
introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These
challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control
methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft
robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical
deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is
to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic
process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic
distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based
control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a
soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the
performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy
in managing the uncertainty inherent in soft robotic systems.

adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2)
insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies.
To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based
framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware
processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment
mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to
guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive
dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii)
depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal
in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that
dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient.
Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a
weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving
estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world
scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods,
achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse
environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement
precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.

TL;DR: 提出 PRBM plus LDM 方法，显著提升软手抓握的控制精度和效率，适用于实时动态性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于软机器人（尤其是软手抓握）的连续变形特性，控制具有挑战性，现有模型计算效率低且参数识别复杂，限制了其实时应用。

Method: 提出了一种结合伪刚体建模（PRBM）与对数递减法（LDM）的参数估计范式（PRBM plus LDM），并在软机器人手测试平台上验证其性能。

Result: PRBM plus LDM 位置控制器的平均最大误差显著低于简单 PID 控制器（4.37 度 vs 20.38 度），在力控制方面也优于恒定压力抓握。

Conclusion: PRBM plus LDM 被证明是一种计算高效且准确的软执行器建模技术，能够实现稳定且灵活的抓握，并具有精确的力调节能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has
accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling
soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their
continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers
for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from
computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their
real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling
Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter
estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate
PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and
benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for
closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID
controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average
maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force
control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks
on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70,
brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a
computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators,
enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

Abstract: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in
physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor
impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are
characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of
motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise
position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many
studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively
contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper
limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the
Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the
Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is
characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high
linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified
fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the
relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both
actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be
set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a
dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators.

instance-level awareness and semantic understanding of environments, limiting
their effectiveness for downstream applications. To address this issue, we
propose OpenMulti, an open-vocabulary instance-level multi-agent distributed
implicit mapping framework. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Agent Instance
Alignment module, which constructs an Instance Collaborative Graph to ensure
consistent instance understanding across agents. To alleviate the degradation
of mapping accuracy due to the blind-zone optimization trap, we leverage Cross
Rendering Supervision to enhance distributed learning of the scene.
Experimental results show that OpenMulti outperforms related algorithms in both
fine-grained geometric accuracy and zero-shot semantic accuracy. In addition,
OpenMulti supports instance-level retrieval tasks, delivering semantic
annotations for downstream applications. The project website of OpenMulti is

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization
of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and
efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis
of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify
collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the
intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations.
Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk,
while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are
aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based
algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic
conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an
autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation
using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的解耦多上下文元学习框架通过显式分配任务因子到不同的上下文向量，提高了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，并在正弦回归任务和四足机器人运动任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods rely on implicit
adaptation to task variations, where multiple factors are mixed together in a
single entangled representation. This makes it difficult to interpret which
factors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we
introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly
assigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these
variations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding
and enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks
with shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a
sinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on
out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing
context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a
quadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties
and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By
transferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into
reinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under
out-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single
unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables
successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with
out-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real
data from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) has made great progress with large language

long-horizon tasks and dynamic scenes. To address this, we propose TopoNav, a
new framework that leverages topological structures as spatial memory. By
building and updating a topological graph that captures scene connections,

distant goals. Our experiments show that TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more
efficient paths. It particularly excels in diverse and complex environments, as
it connects temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding.

examining the impact of on-demand assistance received from a remote human in a
human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly task. We study scenarios in which
users require help and we assess their experiences in requesting and receiving
assistance. Additionally, we investigate participants' perceptions of future
non-human assisting agents and whether assistance should be on-demand or
unsolicited. Through a user study, we analyze the impact that such design
decisions (human or artificial assistant, on-demand or unsolicited help) can
have on elicited emotional responses, productivity, and preferences of humans

Conclusion: FGO-SLAM通过引入不透明度辐射场和全局调整方法，显著提升了Gaussian SLAM系统的几何重建和跟踪精度，实验证明其在多种数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual
capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional
SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction,
and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality
mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face
challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce
FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the
scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial
pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse
point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we
maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and
introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene
representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify
level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across
various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.

Conclusion: 通过简单地增加两个多层感知器来推断6D姿态的随机不确定性，我们的方法在保持预训练预测器不变的同时，实现了高效训练。动态推断的测量不确定性提高了基于对象的相对状态估计任务的性能。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

Abstract: Lane change decision-making for autonomous vehicles is a complex but
high-reward behavior. In this paper, we propose a hybrid input based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which realizes abstract lane change
decisions and lane change actions for autonomous vehicles within traffic flow.
Firstly, a surrounding vehicles trajectory prediction method is proposed to
reduce the risk of future behavior of surrounding vehicles to ego vehicle, and
the prediction results are input into the reinforcement learning model as
additional information. Secondly, to comprehensively leverage environmental
information, the model extracts feature from high-dimensional images and
low-dimensional sensor data simultaneously. The fusion of surrounding vehicle
trajectory prediction and multi-modal information are used as state space of
reinforcement learning to improve the rationality of lane change decision.
Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning macro decisions with end-to-end
vehicle control to achieve a holistic lane change process. Experiments were
conducted within the CARLA simulator, and the results demonstrated that the
utilization of a hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of
vehicle lane change decisions.

Abstract: This paper examines the speculative topic of equitable robots through an
exploratory essay format. It focuses specifically on robots by and for LGBTQ+

what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and
sciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in
fiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses
queering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot
roles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building
and celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by
implementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group''
users, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a
network of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each
other, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions
whether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises.
Finally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics
futures may look like, and what would be required to get there.

Motivation: 尽管基于检索的模仿学习在少量样本学习中表现出色，但现有方法依赖于高方差的最近邻估计且未考虑先验数据的分布，这限制了其性能。

Method: 本研究提出了一种称为重要性加权检索（IWR）的新方法，该方法使用高斯核密度估计（KDE）来计算目标数据分布与先验数据分布之间的比率，从而优化数据检索过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，IWR方法在仿真环境和真实世界的Bridge数据集上均显著提升了现有基于检索的方法的性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入重要性加权检索（IWR）方法，本研究解决了现有检索规则的两个主要缺点，并在仿真环境和真实世界的Bridge数据集上验证了IWR方法的有效性。

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

Conclusion: MoTo模块通过结合现成的操纵基础模型，显著提升了移动操纵的泛化能力和零样本能力，无需额外训练数据。

Abstract: Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots
to assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.
Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across
different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.
However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate
impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation
tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a
plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf
manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.
Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate
robot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot
ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language
models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic
arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can
be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base
and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and
maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the
robot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be
successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory
optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any
requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results
on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%
and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods,
respectively, without requiring additional training data.

Conclusion: ArtiPoint 框架在动态相机运动和部分可观测条件下，能够有效估计铰接物体模型，并在 Arti4D 数据集上表现出优越性能。代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个约束解码框架，用于机器人基础模型，确保生成的动作在运行时满足信号时序逻辑（STL）规范，无需重新训练，并且与底层基础模型无关。

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

Conclusion: Fail2Progress方法通过并行生成多个模拟环境，有效提高了从失败中学习的能力，并在多个复杂移动操作任务中表现出色，优于多个基线方法。

Abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures
in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling
robots to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the
problem of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures.
After fine-tuning a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent
to which the model can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We
propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference
to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient
data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of
handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting
multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization.
Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of
objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需调参的梯度优化方法，通过策略梯度投影在任务和能量目标之间实现能量最小化，同时不影响任务性能。在标准基准测试中能量使用减少64%，并展示了Sim2Real迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中直接惩罚能量使用需要精细调整权重，可能导致任务性能与能量消耗之间的不良权衡。

Method: 采用策略梯度投影方法，在任务和能量目标之间进行优化，避免冲突。

Result: 在DM-Control和HumanoidBench基准测试中能量使用减少64%，且任务性能未受影响，成功实现了Sim2Real迁移。

Conclusion: 该方法为能量高效控制提供了一种无需调参的替代方案，易于集成到现有强化学习流程中。

Abstract: Efficient robot control often requires balancing task performance with energy
expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize
energy use directly as part of the reward function. This requires carefully
tuning weight terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization
harms task success. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient
optimization method to minimize energy expenditure without conflicting with
task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method
applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to derive
policy updates that minimize energy expenditure in ways that do not impact task
performance. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of
DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of 64% energy usage
while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments
on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient
policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal
code changes, is applicable to any policy gradient method, and offers a
principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.

Abstract: This paper introduces ManiFlow, a visuomotor imitation learning policy for
general robot manipulation that generates precise, high-dimensional actions
conditioned on diverse visual, language and proprioceptive inputs. We leverage
flow matching with consistency training to enable high-quality dexterous action
generation in just 1-2 inference steps. To handle diverse input modalities
efficiently, we propose DiT-X, a diffusion transformer architecture with
adaptive cross-attention and AdaLN-Zero conditioning that enables fine-grained

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Transformer的多船轨迹预测框架，整合碰撞风险分析，显著提升预测准确性和海上安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动模型主要局限于单船预测，忽视了船只互动、航行规则和显式碰撞风险评估，因此需要一种更全面的多船轨迹预测方法。

Method: 框架通过并行流编码运动学和衍生物理特征，使用因果卷积处理时间局部性，空间变换进行位置编码，以及混合位置嵌入捕捉局部运动模式和长程依赖。

Result: 在大规模真实AIS数据上评估，该模型在联合多船指标上表现出超越传统单船位移误差的优越预测能力，并能通过模拟预测轨迹的互动量化潜在碰撞风险。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于Transformer的多船轨迹预测框架不仅提高了预测准确性，还整合了碰撞风险分析，为海上安全和决策支持提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational
awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are
constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel
interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

Abstract: Marine ecosystems face increasing pressure due to climate change, driving the
need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: AutoDrive-R$^2$通过结合链式思维处理和强化学习，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的推理和自省能力，并在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上展现了最先进的性能和强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary
surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is
studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of
performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging
Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission
complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and
efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission
objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study
presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration,
integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a
scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical
scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key
capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework
which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo
simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its
robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system
feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior
execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is
middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and
extending beyond aerial robotics.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个基于主纤维束的滑动模式控制器设计框架，适用于具有对称性的机械系统，并通过李雅普诺夫分析证明了几乎全局渐近稳定性和局部指数稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers
for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and
constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed
based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a
sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base
space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design
complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations
when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a
sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic
controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state
manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general
sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of
the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding
subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate
covariant derivative. Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential
stability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. We apply the results to a
fully actuated system (a rigid spacecraft actuated by reaction wheels) and a
subactuated nonholonomic system (unicycle mobile robot actuated by wheels),
which is also simulated for illustration.

Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks
faces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality
(VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition.
This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual
admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception
Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The
VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target
objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN
processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and
environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to
overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four
conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly
improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency
by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with
implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for
multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across
various applications in the future.

Abstract: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially
snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across
conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use.
In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap
between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective
denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose
estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time
applications.
  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that
evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective
detection of sparse and discrete noise.
  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive
point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local
regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity
threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and
then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight
prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is
trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various
scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear
and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and
paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across
a wider range of environmental conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练的VLA模型在通用机器人操作方面表现出巨大潜力，但在适应下游任务时，尤其是当机器人体现或任务本身与预训练数据不同时，动作分布的显著不匹配导致需要大量数据和计算资源进行有效微调。

Method: ATE首先通过构建统一的潜在空间来对齐不同的动作空间，其中变分自编码器受反向KL散度约束，将适应动作嵌入预训练动作潜在分布的模态中。随后，在微调过程中通过引导机制引导基于扩散或流的VLA生成过程，将模型输出分布推向目标领域。

Result: 实验表明，与直接微调代表性VLA模型相比，该方法在模拟中平均多任务成功率提高了9.8%，在真实世界跨体现设置中实现了32%的成功率提升。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种名为Align-Then-stEer (ATE)的新型、数据高效且即插即用的适应框架，显著提升了VLA模型在新机器人平台和任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Result: 算法在所有测试案例中成功识别了完整的基础参数集，DRNG算法在理论上的复杂度为O(1)。

Conclusion: 该方法在四种机器人上验证成功，显示出高鲁棒性和计算效率，特别是在并联机构（PKM）中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the
base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is
reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new
identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid
body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model
are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations.
Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for
base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points
principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms
are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core
algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG),
achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity
preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed
method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a
2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all
cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base
parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and
computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the
comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and
efficient.

Conclusion: HPLSV 方法通过将学习到的社会导航成本函数作为启发式搜索路径规划的额外启发式，能够有效提升机器人在社会导航中的表现，尤其是在加入队列等常见社会场景中。

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value
(HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social
navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path
planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common
social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of
generalizing to further human activities.

Abstract: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing
various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base
placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a
bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these
hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions.
However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible,
introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These
trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel
optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In
this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding
optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive
simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level
optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing
computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are
applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two
palletization scenarios.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
revolutionised embodied artificial intelligence, enabling advanced

Abstract: Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous
navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g.,
camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual
occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In
this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the
risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration
capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as
a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and
accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance
signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based
hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts
then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically
designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.
We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a
self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic
prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously
reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively.
Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate
classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing
methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate
3D radar perception.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents
significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and
the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on
multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task
that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual
perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large
Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based
perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based
planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action
primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with
action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a
SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion
mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to
achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In
simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3
on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a
real robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language
instructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating
strong generalization in practical scenarios. Project page:

Abstract: Optical microrobots actuated by optical tweezers (OT) offer great potential
for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and microscale assembly.
These tasks demand accurate three-dimensional perception to ensure precise
control in complex and dynamic biological environments. However, the
transparent nature of microrobots and low-contrast microscopic imaging
challenge conventional deep learning methods, which also require large
annotated datasets that are costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we
propose a physics-informed, data-efficient framework for depth estimation of
optical microrobots. Our method augments convolutional feature extraction with
physics-based focus metrics, such as entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, and
gradient sharpness, calculated using an adaptive grid strategy. This approach
allocates finer grids over microrobot regions and coarser grids over background
areas, enhancing depth sensitivity while reducing computational complexity. We
evaluate our framework on multiple microrobot types and demonstrate significant
improvements over baseline models. Specifically, our approach reduces mean
squared error (MSE) by over 60% and improves the coefficient of determination
(R^2) across all test cases. Notably, even when trained on only 20% of the
available data, our model outperforms ResNet50 trained on the full dataset,
highlighting its robustness under limited data conditions. Our code is

Abstract: Indoor built environments like homes and offices often present complex and
cluttered layouts that pose significant challenges for individuals who are
blind or visually impaired, especially when performing tasks that involve
locating and gathering multiple objects. While many existing assistive
technologies focus on basic navigation or obstacle avoidance, few systems
provide scalable and efficient multi-object search capabilities in real-world,
partially observable settings. To address this gap, we introduce OpenGuide, an
assistive mobile robot system that combines natural language understanding with
vision-language foundation models (VLM), frontier-based exploration, and a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner. OpenGuide
interprets open-vocabulary requests, reasons about object-scene relationships,
and adaptively navigates and localizes multiple target items in novel
environments. Our approach enables robust recovery from missed detections
through value decay and belief-space reasoning, resulting in more effective
exploration and object localization. We validate OpenGuide in simulated and
real-world experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in task success
rate and search efficiency over prior methods. This work establishes a
foundation for scalable, human-centered robotic assistance in assisted living

Abstract: Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in
the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful
integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and
challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics
software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor
alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or
deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help
solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for
building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that
maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying
low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by
introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process
to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without
limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral
in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of
increasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion
mitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software,
Coral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system
integration challenges, improving component reusability, system
reconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We
release Coral open source.

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in
robotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution,
low manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common
design features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity
of sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data
interpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that
categorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the
underlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based
Transduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.
Marker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker
displacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based
Transduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.
Depending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be
further divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological
Marker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction
Principle encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent
Layer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the
hardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various
combination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting
tactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by
VBTS technology and directions for future research.

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving

degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

### [385] [Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01245)
*Yusheng Zheng,Yanpeng Hu,Wei Zhang,Andi Quinn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchedCP是一个让LLM代理自主优化Linux调度器的框架，通过解耦控制平面和MCP服务器实现高效优化，性能提升1.79倍，成本降低13倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作系统调度器存在基本的语义鸿沟，内核策略无法理解应用特定需求，导致性能不佳。SchedCP旨在通过自主的LLM代理安全高效地优化Linux调度器，解决这一问题。

Method: SchedCP框架采用解耦的控制平面架构，将AI的语义推理角色（'优化什么'）与系统的执行角色（'如何观察和行动'）分离，并通过MCP服务器提供三个关键服务：工作负载分析引擎、演进的调度策略仓库和执行验证器。

Result: SchedCP实现了高达1.79倍的性能提升和13倍的成本降低，同时保持高成功率。

Conclusion: SchedCP通过桥接语义鸿沟，实现了专家级系统优化的民主化，并朝着创建真正自优化、应用感知的操作系统迈出了一步。

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced
in https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/schedcp

*Eric Zhang,Li Wei,Sarah Chen,Michael Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了四种口吃检测方法，发现UDM在准确性和可解释性上表现最佳，同时提供了实施和部署的实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管口吃检测模型的性能在基准数据集上不断提升，但临床采用不仅需要准确性，还需要模型的可控性和可解释性。

Method: 本文对四种方法进行了全面评估，包括在多数据集上的性能测试和临床专家评估。

Result: 研究发现，YOLO-Stutter和FluentNet效率高且简单，但透明度有限；UDM在准确性和临床可解释性之间取得了最佳平衡；SSDM虽然有潜力，但在实验中无法完全复现。

Conclusion: 本文通过系统比较四种代表性方法（YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM和SSDM），揭示了它们在性能、可控性和可解释性方面的权衡，并指出了未来临床可行口吃建模的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

*Terry Jingchen Zhang,Gopal Dev,Ning Wang,Nicole Ni,Wenyuan Jiang,Yinya Huang,Bernhard Schölkopf,Mrinmaya Sachan,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过合成多步推理问题评估LLMs，发现模型在知识截止日期后性能未显著衰减，表明基准测试可能更侧重推理而非记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对数据污染的担忧增加，静态基准测试是否真正衡量了模型的推理能力而非记忆能力成为疑问。

Method: 研究者使用了一个可无限扩展的框架，直接从arXiv论文中合成研究级QA问题，利用研究出版物的自然时间结构，观察知识截止日期后的性能衰减。

Result: 评估的4个前沿模型在1,643个多步推理问题上表现一致，未在知识截止日期附近显示出显著性能衰减。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，前沿模型在知识截止日期附近并未表现出显著的性能衰减，这暗示静态基准测试可能更多评估的是模型的推理能力而非记忆能力。

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出一个计算框架，通过将语言模型转化为概率模型，模拟人类的社会学习，实验证明语言指导能加速学习和减少风险，促进人机协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类如何整合语言指导和直接经验，以及AI系统如何实现这一点，以实现安全快速的学习。

Method: 将预训练的语言模型转化为概率模型，模拟人类分享建议的条件信念，使代理能够生成建议并解释语言输入作为贝叶斯推断的证据。

Result: 通过10个视频游戏的行为实验和模拟，展示了语言指导如何塑造探索并加速学习，减少风险交互并加快关键发现。

Conclusion: 结构化、兼容语言的表示可能实现人机协作学习。

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

*Andrew G. A. Correa,Ana C. H de Matos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 熵引导的细化方法通过不确定性触发单次修正，使小型模型在低成本下接近大型推理模型的性能，适用于生产环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前推理模型在高质量输出时伴随的高成本和延迟问题，寻求一种在质量和成本之间取得平衡的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于熵引导的轻量级测试时循环，利用词级不确定性触发单次有针对性的细化过程。具体包括提取对数概率、计算香农熵、应用OR逻辑触发机制，并将不确定性报告反馈给模型以指导修正。

Result: 在多个任务中，小型模型结合该方法可达到参考推理模型95%的质量，成本仅为三分之一，同时在31%的响应中选择性细化，准确率提升16个百分点。

Conclusion: 熵引导的细化方法在保持低成本的同时，显著提升了小型模型的推理质量，使其接近大型推理模型的性能，适用于生产环境。

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

TL;DR: 研究通过模拟代理的情感识别准确性，发现低准确性导致社会崩溃，高准确性则促进稳定和抗干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨情感识别准确性如何影响社会行为和情感整合，以理解人类社交行为的基础。

Method: 研究通过在2D环形格子上实例化具有不同准确性情感分类器的代理，模拟了情感识别准确性对行为和空间组织的影响。代理使用来自KDEF数据库的面部照片，并配备了基于JAFFE（低）、CK+（中）或KDEF（高）数据集训练的分类器。

Result: 低准确性分类器导致信任减少、情感崩溃和社会组织混乱，而高准确性分类器形成稳定的情感集群和抗干扰能力。即使在情感中性场景中，误识别也足以导致分离和凝聚力瓦解。

Conclusion: 研究表明，情感识别的准确性对社会过程和情感整合有显著影响。低准确性的情感分类器会导致信任减少、情感崩溃和社会组织混乱，而高准确性的分类器则能形成稳定的情感集群和抗干扰能力。

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在高风险决策中的作用增加，确保其与人类价值观对齐变得至关重要。依赖专有API限制了可复现性和广泛参与。

Method: 研究采用了150场辩论，涵盖15种场景和五种集成配置，使用7点评分标准进行评估。

Result: 集成模型在7点评分标准上优于单一模型基线（3.48 vs. 3.13），在推理深度（+19.4%）和论据质量（+34.1%）上提升最大，尤其是在真实性（+1.25分）和人类增强（+0.80分）方面。

Conclusion: 通过本地开源模型集成辩论的方法，可以显著提升语言模型在人类价值观对齐方面的表现，特别是在推理深度和论据质量上。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes
decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary
APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local
open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across
150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles
outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human
enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing
an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment
evaluation.

*Rahul Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MODE是一种轻量级检索方法，通过聚类和路由检索替代传统RAG，适用于中小型语料库，兼顾速度与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小型领域特定集合，传统检索增强生成（RAG）依赖大型向量数据库和跨编码器可能过于复杂。

Method: MODE采用聚类和路由检索替代细粒度最近邻搜索，文档被嵌入、分组为语义连贯的聚类，并通过缓存质心表示。查询时，路由到顶部质心并在这些聚类内检索上下文。

Result: 在HotpotQA和SQuAD语料库（100-500个块）上，MODE在回答质量上与密集检索基线相当或更优，同时减少了端到端检索时间。

Conclusion: MODE提供了一个针对中小型语料库的实用解决方案，强调简单性、速度和主题聚焦。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

Motivation: 填补之前研究中缺乏算法实例化和实证证据的空白，并解决当前评估中技术指标主导的问题。

Method: 本文首先回顾了近期基准和工业部署，然后提出了AMDM算法，该算法通过归一化异构指标、应用每轴指数加权移动平均阈值和利用马氏距离进行联合异常检测。

Result: AMDM算法将异常检测延迟从12.3秒降低到5.6秒，并将误报率从4.5%降低到0.9%。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出自适应多维监控（AMDM）算法，显著提高了异常检测的效率和准确性，填补了之前研究的空白。

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DACE算法通过动态调整探索与利用的平衡，利用模型自我确定性指导学习，显著提升LLMs在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVF技术依赖稀疏的基于结果的奖励，无法为推理过程提供细粒度指导，限制了学习效率和模型从不同类型失败中学习的能力。

Method: 引入Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE)算法，基于策略成功率在线评估任务难度，并据此调整内在奖励机制。

Result: 在AIME和MATH等数学推理基准测试中，DACE显著优于基线方法，模型不仅准确率更高，且在计算资源扩展时表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: DACE算法通过动态调整探索与利用的平衡，显著提升了LLMs在数学推理任务上的性能，不仅提高了准确性，还增强了计算资源扩展时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

Conclusion: 本文提出的HARP工具和两种算法在埃塞俄比亚三个地区的实证应用中显示出显著效果，为资源有限情况下的医疗设施规划提供了有效的决策支持。

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

Motivation: 现有自主代理范式在环境变化时面临固定工作流需手动重构与灵活反应循环无法转移推理进展的权衡问题。

Method: HiVA框架将代理工作流建模为自组织图，利用STEV算法在混合语义-拓扑空间中进行优化，使用文本梯度作为离散域的反向传播替代。

Result: 在对话、编码、长上下文问答、数学和代理基准测试中，HiVA实现了5-10%的任务准确性提升和更高的资源效率。

Conclusion: HiVA框架通过STEV算法在未知环境中有效优化了自主任务执行，显著提高了任务准确性和资源效率。

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在预训练后静态化的问题，避免检索增强生成（RAG）和微调带来的延迟、工程开销和知识冲突。

Method: 提出Instruction-Level Weight Shaping（ILWS），通过反射引擎诊断对话轨迹，生成类型化的增量（ΔK），并通过版本控制、评估和自动修复机制更新指令。

Result: 在企业支持中，吞吐量提高了2.4-5.0倍，审计幻觉减少了约80%；在Adobe Commerce Cloud的测试中，每小时处理工单量增加了4-5倍，单工单时间减少了约80%。

Conclusion: ILWS（指令级权重塑造）通过将指令层的改进转化为权重空间，显著提升了模型在动态领域的适应性和效率，同时保持了治理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

Method: 提出SHERPA模型驱动框架，利用分层状态机结构化LLM执行过程，结合基于规则或机器学习（包括LLM）的决策机制。

Conclusion: SHERPA框架通过将领域特定最佳实践融入分层状态机，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂任务中的表现，尤其在缺乏训练数据但已有成熟人类最佳实践的任务中效果显著。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市空间中多模态数据丰富但分散，依赖人工推理难以有效整合和关联数据以识别事件原因或预测未来事件。

Method: SIGMUS利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成必要的世界知识，识别城市空间中事件与多模态数据之间的关系，并将这些知识组织成知识图谱。

Result: SIGMUS系统能够合理关联5种不同数据源（新闻文本、CCTV图像、空气质量、天气和交通测量）与同时同地发生的相关事件。

Conclusion: SIGMUS系统通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）成功实现了多模态城市数据与事件之间的语义关联，无需依赖人工编码规则，为城市事件的分析和预测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

Motivation: 研究自主代理系统在多大程度上能提高多模态网络数据的生产力，特别是在需要迭代规划、解释和上下文推理的新闻领域。

Method: 引入NEWSAGENT基准，评估代理如何自动搜索原始内容、选择信息、编辑和重写以形成新闻文章。

Result: 代理能够检索相关事实，但在规划和叙事整合方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT提供了一个现实的测试平台，用于评估和迭代代理在多模态网络数据操作方面的能力，以提升实际生产力。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

Motivation: 冰激凌融化稳定性对消费者接受度和产品质量至关重要，研究旨在评估不同添加剂对融化抗性的影响，并寻找更具成本效益的配方。

Method: 制备含有不同添加剂（刺槐豆胶、瓜尔胶、麦芽糊精和卡拉胶）的冰激凌样品，并在受控条件下进行融化测试，使用Python和OpenCV进行时间推移记录和数据分析。

Result: 所有样品融化后仍保持泡沫状结构，表明稳定剂有助于形成稳定的气胞矩阵；重新冻结后再次融化的样品显示出更强的结构韧性。不同稳定剂的效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究表明，不同稳定剂在冰激凌融化稳定性和结构支持方面效果各异，通过评估性能和成本，可以开发出既耐用又经济的配方，适用于小规模和商业生产。

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个可扩展、可解释且符合伦理的集体AI概念基础和架构路线图。

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

Motivation: 人类能凭直觉导航社交互动，而AI系统在自动结构和推理这些隐式社交上下文方面存在困难。S3AP旨在帮助AI系统更有效地推理社交动态。

Method: 采用POMDP驱动的设计，S3AP将社交互动表示为结构化元组（如状态、观察、代理行动和心智状态），这些可以从自由形式叙述中自动归纳。

Result: S3AP在5个社交推理任务中帮助LLMs更好地理解社交叙述（如在FANToM的心智理论推理上提升51%），并在SOTOPIA社交互动基准上实现高达18%的改进。

Conclusion: S3AP作为一种强大的通用社交世界状态表示形式，展示了其在提升AI系统社交互动能力方面的潜力，为开发更具社交意识的系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

Conclusion: BALM-TSF通过平衡时间序列和文本模态的跨模态对齐，有效提升了预测性能，并在长期和少样本预测中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发通用ML模型需要从具有多样真实世界网络应用流量的环境中收集数据，但现有浏览器自动化工具在多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率方面仍显脆弱且成本高昂。

Method: NetGent允许用户以自然语言规则定义状态依赖的操作，这些抽象规范被编译成非确定性有限自动机（NFA），并由状态合成组件转换为可重用的可执行代码。

Result: 实验中，NetGent自动化了50多个工作流程，涵盖视频点播、直播、视频会议、社交媒体和网络爬取，生成了真实的流量轨迹，同时对UI变化保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NetGent通过结合基于语言的灵活性与编译执行的可靠性，为生成多样化、可重复的网络数据集提供了可扩展的基础，推动了网络领域机器学习的发展。

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Method: 本文引入了一种模块化多智能体框架，将法律推理分解为知识获取和应用两个阶段。第一阶段通过专门智能体提取法律概念并形式化规则，创建可验证的中间表示；第二阶段通过分析查询、符号推理和生成最终答案三个步骤将知识应用于具体案例。

Conclusion: 模块化架构与形式化知识表示可以使复杂的法律推理通过计算高效模型更易实现，同时增强AI法律推理的一致性和可解释性，为未来研究更透明、可信和有效的法律领域AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

Result: 实验表明，OmniDPO不仅有效缓解多模态幻觉，还显著提升了模型跨模态推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniDPO框架通过偏好对齐策略有效减少了OLLMs中的幻觉问题，并提升了跨模态推理能力。

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 结构化上下文注入是一种有效且可扩展的策略，能够提升LLMs在图理解任务中的表现，其性能可与更复杂的方法相媲美甚至超越。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

Conclusion: L-MARS通过多智能体推理与检索的结合，为高风险的法学领域提供了一个可扩展且可复制的LLM部署蓝图。

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

TL;DR: SWE-PRM通过实时干预和分类引导反馈，显著提升了LLM代理在软件工程任务中的效率和成功率，且成本可控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在执行复杂多步软件工程任务时存在效率低下的问题，如冗余探索、循环和未能及时终止。现有方法多为事后诊断，无法实时干预。

Method: 引入SWE-PRM，一个推理时的过程奖励模型，通过轻量级、可解释的反馈来检测和纠正轨迹级错误，无需修改底层策略。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，PRM将解决率从40.0%提升至50.6%（+10.6个百分点），尤其在中等和困难任务上表现突出。分类引导的PRM在反馈策略中表现最佳，同时减少了轨迹长度。

Conclusion: SWE-PRM作为一种推理时过程奖励模型，显著提高了LLM代理在复杂软件工程任务中的成功率和效率，且增加的推理成本在可接受范围内。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

TL;DR: 通过物理感知拒绝采样（PaRS）训练大型学生模型，提升了AI驱动材料发现的推理能力，实现了更准确、物理可接受的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数训练流程使用二元正确性或学习到的偏好信号来选择推理轨迹，这些方法难以反映物理可接受性，因此需要开发更准确的预测模型。

Method: 引入了物理感知拒绝采样（PaRS），一种训练时的轨迹选择方案，优先选择符合基础物理且数值接近目标的轨迹，并采用轻量级停止机制控制计算成本。

Result: 该方法提高了准确性和校准性，降低了物理违规率，并相对于基线方法减少了采样成本。

Conclusion: 结合领域感知的约束和轨迹级选择，为过程感知属性预测和闭环材料设计提供了一条实用路径，实现了可靠且高效的大型推理模型（LRMs）。

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态规划类型算法，通过Dinkelbach变换和迭代优化，解决了MDPs中夏普比率优化的两大挑战，并验证了算法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夏普比率是金融领域广泛使用的指标，但在MDPs中优化其值面临两个主要挑战：动态规划不适用于分数目标和风险度量。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用Dinkelbach变换将夏普比率目标转换为均方-方差（M2V）目标，并开发了一种迭代算法，通过不断更新风险敏感参数来优化M2V问题。

Result: 提出的算法在长期平均和折扣MDP设置中均能收敛到最优夏普比率，数值实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文成功解决了在马尔可夫决策过程（MDPs）中优化夏普比率（Sharpe Ratio）的挑战，通过Dinkelbach变换和迭代算法，实现了动态规划类型算法的应用，并验证了其收敛性和有效性。

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合神经学习和符号逻辑的后缀预测方法，通过可微逻辑损失函数提高预测的逻辑一致性，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的后缀预测方法由于缺乏领域知识的显式整合，往往无法满足基本的逻辑约束。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的方法，将有限轨迹上的线性时态逻辑（LTLf）整合到自回归序列预测器的训练过程中，通过引入可微的逻辑损失函数（基于LTLf语义的软近似和Gumbel-Softmax技巧）来确保模型生成既准确又逻辑一致的后缀。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验评估表明，该方法提高了后缀预测的准确性和时态约束的符合性。此外，还引入了两种逻辑损失变体（局部和全局），并在噪声和现实场景下验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合数据驱动学习和时态逻辑先验知识的神经符号预测过程监控方法，显著提高了后缀预测的准确性和逻辑一致性，并为神经符号AI的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中闭环胰岛素输送系统（CLIDS）的采用率低，主要由于行为、心理和社会障碍，而非技术失败。

Method: 引入ChatCLIDS基准，包括专家验证的虚拟患者库和模拟多轮对话的护士代理，支持纵向咨询和对抗性社会影响场景。

Result: 研究发现，尽管更大、更具反思性的LLM能随时间调整策略，但所有模型在克服阻力，尤其是现实社会压力下仍表现不佳。

Conclusion: ChatCLIDS为评估LLM驱动的健康行为改变对话提供了高保真、可扩展的测试平台，揭示了当前LLM在克服行为改变阻力方面的局限性，尤其是在现实社会压力下。

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Motivation: 解决MCCFR与深度神经网络结合时因游戏规模不同而引发的挑战，如非平稳目标分布偏移、动作支持崩溃等问题。

Method: 采用目标网络延迟更新、均匀探索混合、方差感知训练目标和全面诊断监控等方法。

Result: 在Kuhn Poker中最终可利用性为0.0628，比经典框架提升60%；在Leduc Poker中可利用性为0.2386，提升23.5%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了Robust Deep MCCFR框架，通过自适应选择和部署组件，显著提高了在Kuhn和Leduc Poker中的表现，并提供了部署更大规模游戏的实际指南。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准和数据集缺乏对多维度系统分析和训练所需的变量控制，或者问题类型和格式过于狭窄，因此需要一种可控且可扩展的工具来细粒度分析LLM的推理能力。

Method: 通过从CNF实例生成多样化的基于可满足性的逻辑推理问题，SATQuest沿着三个正交维度（实例规模、问题类型和问题格式）结构化这些问题，并采用随机化、基于SAT的问题生成和通过PySAT的客观答案验证。

Result: 对多种LLM的广泛评估揭示了它们在逻辑推理方面的显著局限性，特别是在超越熟悉的数学格式的泛化方面。此外，通过SATQuest奖励的强化微调显著提高了目标任务的性能，并泛化到更复杂的实例。

Conclusion: SATQuest展示了其作为评估和增强LLM逻辑推理能力的潜力，特别是在跨格式适应方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

Method: LENS结合了符号程序合成与大型语言模型（LLMs），通过神经摘要自动生成逻辑程序的自然语言解释，替代了手工制作的解释模板。

Result: LENS生成的解释优于直接LLM提示和手工模板，但在人类学习实验中未观察到显著的性能提升，表明LLM的全面响应可能对简单问题用户造成负担。

Conclusion: LENS为构建支持人类学习的有效USML系统奠定了坚实基础，尽管在简单问题上LLM的全面响应可能对用户造成负担而非提供学习支持。

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

Result: 在Livecodebench v6上达到66.66%，Instruction-Following Evals上达到89%，ARC-AGI-2上达到24.4%，并在SWE-Bench Lite上实现了62.3%的最先进准确率。

Conclusion: CoreThink模型通过General Symbolics方法在无需微调或训练成本的情况下，显著提升了推理任务的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的成绩。

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

Conclusion: ReaL-TG框架通过强化学习微调LLMs，在真实世界时序图上实现了可解释的链接预测，并在排名指标和推理质量上优于前沿LLMs。

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Conclusion: 数据系统需要适应以更原生地支持代理工作负载，提出了以代理优先的数据系统架构的新研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.

our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

Result: 实验显示当前GUI代理在完整故事弧上表现不佳，而COAST通过弥补观察-行为差距提升了里程碑完成率。

Conclusion: 尽管COAST通过弥补观察-行为差距提升了里程碑完成率，但人类与最佳性能代理之间的显著差异表明仍需进一步研究以缩小这一差距。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

Motivation: 现有ARLT方法存在代码库碎片化、同步执行瓶颈和跨领域扩展性不足的问题，阻碍了社区采用和算法创新。

Method: VerlTool通过（1）上游对齐VeRL，（2）标准化API统一工具管理，（3）异步执行消除同步瓶颈，（4）跨6个ARLT领域的综合评估，实现了多模态观察和多轮交互的扩展。

Result: VerlTool在数学推理、知识QA、SQL生成、视觉推理、网络搜索和软件工程任务中表现优异，达到与专用系统相当的结果，同时提供统一的训练基础设施。

Conclusion: VerlTool作为统一且模块化的框架，通过系统性设计原则解决了现有ARLT方法的局限性，提供了兼容性、统一工具管理、异步执行和全面评估，为工具增强的RL研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Motivation: 为了解决机器人执行复杂指令、规划长时任务和自然与人交互的挑战，Robix被设计为一个统一的视觉-语言架构，整合了高层认知功能。

Method: Robix采用三阶段训练策略：持续预训练增强基础推理能力，监督微调统一建模人机交互和任务规划，强化学习提升推理-行动一致性和长时任务连贯性。

Result: 实验表明，Robix在交互式任务执行中优于GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro等基线模型，能泛化处理多种指令类型和用户任务。

Conclusion: Robix作为一个统一的视觉-语言架构，在机器人推理、任务规划和自然语言交互方面表现出色，显著优于现有开源和商业基线模型，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819
arXiv:1812.03789, defined here as causal abstractive simulation, can be used to
formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers
the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are
presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a
success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove
that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers
of mind may be interested as causal abstractive simulation gives a precise
operationalization to the idea that language models are role-playing

Motivation: 电子商务中SKU映射的挑战在于缺乏明确标识符且产品名称差异大，传统基于规则和关键词相似性的方法易忽略品牌、规格等细微差异，导致误分类。

Method: Q2K框架包含三个核心组件：推理代理生成澄清问题、知识代理通过精准网络搜索解答问题、去重代理复用已验证的推理轨迹以减少冗余。此外，引入人类反馈机制优化不确定案例。

Result: 在真实消费品数据集上的实验表明，Q2K在准确性和鲁棒性上优于基线方法，尤其在复杂场景（如捆绑识别和品牌来源消歧）中表现突出。

Conclusion: Q2K框架通过结合多智能体协作和人类反馈，提供了一个高效、可扩展且可解释的SKU映射解决方案，显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Motivation: 解决现有基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法在开放世界场景中因依赖预定义锚实体而导致的鲁棒性不足问题。

Method: 提出AnchorRAG，一种基于多智能体协作的框架，包括动态预测候选锚实体、并行多跳检索和知识路径合成的策略。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中，AnchorRAG显著优于现有基线方法，并在真实世界问答任务中取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: AnchorRAG通过多智能体协作框架显著提升了开放世界中检索增强生成的鲁棒性，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成复杂SQL查询时仍存在与用户意图和数据库模式对齐的挑战，需要更有效的测试时策略。

Method: 通过训练Outcome Reward Models（ORMs）并与其他测试时策略（如ex-BoN和Maj）进行比较，评估其在BIRD和SPIDER基准上的表现。

Result: ORMs在BIRD和SPIDER基准上分别比ex-BoN和Maj提高了执行准确率，且在简单查询和增加候选数量时表现更优。

Conclusion: ORMs在Text-to-SQL任务中表现优于ex-BoN和Maj，特别是在复杂查询和对齐用户意图方面，展示了显著的执行准确率提升。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

Motivation: 现有的QPM方法在多模态动态系统下表现不佳，因为它们无法区分不同模式，导致预测区间过于保守且缺乏模式特定的满意度信息。

Method: GenQPM利用基于分数的扩散模型来近似系统的概率和多模态动态，并通过模式分类器对预测轨迹进行分区，为每个模式应用符合推理生成统计有效的预测区间。

Result: 在导航和自动驾驶任务基准测试中，GenQPM生成的预测区间比模式无关的基线方法显著更信息丰富（更不保守）。

Conclusion: GenQPM通过结合深度生成模型和模式分类器，为多模态系统动态提供了更精确的模式特定预测区间，显著提高了预测信息的实用性和准确性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

TL;DR: DeepResearch Arena 是一个基于学术研讨会的基准，通过MAHTG系统生成高质量研究任务，评估深度研究代理的能力，结果显示现有代理表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以收集真正反映研究者关注和智力好奇心的前沿研究问题，评估深度研究代理的研究能力具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了多代理分层任务生成（MAHTG）系统，从研讨会转录中提取研究灵感并转化为高质量研究任务，确保任务的可追溯性和噪声过滤。

Result: 构建了包含12个学科、超过10,000个高质量研究任务的DeepResearch Arena，现有先进代理在该基准上表现存在明显差距。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena 作为一个基于学术研讨会的新基准，有效捕捉了真实研究环境中的复杂性和多样性，为评估深度研究代理的研究能力提供了高质量的任务集。

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

Motivation: AI和LLMs能以远超传统方法的规模和速度生成假设，但缺乏可扩展和可靠的验证机制可能阻碍而非推动科学进步。

Method: 回顾了历史发展，探讨了AI如何重塑科学发现实践，并评估了主要方法，包括数据驱动方法、知识感知神经架构、符号推理框架和LLM代理。

Result: AI系统能够发现模式和提出候选定律，但其科学价值取决于验证的严谨性和透明度。

Conclusion: AI在科学发现中的价值依赖于严格和透明的验证机制，这应是AI辅助发现的核心。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于LLM代理的场景生成器设计方法，有效提升了服务生态系统治理中实验系统的构建质量和效率。

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在关键领域中依赖错误或无关推理轨迹的问题，提高其可信度。

Method: 提出Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)训练目标，通过操作级反事实干预（如交换运算符）和惩罚无效推理轨迹，增强中间推理与最终输出的依赖性。

Result: 在算术、逻辑推理和规划任务中，CSR将可信度提高了70个百分点，且准确性损失较小。

Conclusion: CSR通过引入自动化的反事实干预，显著提高了LLMs在结构化推理任务中的可信度，同时保持了较高的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

Motivation: 随着AI在安全关键领域（如航空航天和应急服务）中应用，需要解决其决策的伦理影响，确保决策可靠且可辩护。

Method: 提出了一种结构化决策框架，通过引入Enabler agents、Levels和Scenarios概念，并在灾害管理中进行实施。

Result: 该框架相比基于判断的系统，决策稳定性提高了60.94%；相比人类操作员，准确率提高了38.93%。

Conclusion: 结构化决策框架在安全关键领域中展现出构建更可靠自主AI应用的潜力。

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

Result: 框架实现了计算不对称性，响应生成成本比SOTA模型高9.2倍，并通过实际部署和评估验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了Web Agent Throttling框架，通过设计Rebus-based Reasoning Gates来有效限制AI网络代理的访问，同时讨论了其实施的限制和环境影晌。

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，用户试图利用这些模型进行恶意行为（如合成受控物质和传播虚假信息）的担忧日益增加。现有防御方法虽然有效，但其原理仍不明确。

Method: 我们提出了一种新颖的神经元级可解释性方法，将模型的内部表示投影到更一致且可解释的词汇空间，并调整安全相关神经元的激活。

Result: 调整安全相关神经元的激活可以高效控制模型行为（平均ASR超过97%）。SafeTuning策略在多个LLMs上显著降低了攻击成功率，并优于所有四种基线防御方法。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的神经元级可解释性方法，通过调整安全相关神经元的激活来控制模型行为，并提出了SafeTuning微调策略，显著提高了模型对越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出用LLM自动分析隐私政策，构建知识图谱（Pr²Graph），支持生成正式政策表示，并公开数据集和代码，助力大规模隐私实践分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私政策难以理解，用户通常忽略阅读，导致数据隐私实践成为用户中心化网络方法和数据共享的障碍。现有研究虽提出使用形式语言验证政策合规性，但缺乏大规模创建或获取此类正式政策的方法。

Method: 使用最先进的大型语言模型（LLM）自动识别隐私政策中的关键信息，构建基于数据隐私词汇（DPV）的知识图谱（Pr²Graph），并生成正式政策表示（如ODRL或psDToU）。通过法律专家定制注释丰富了Policy-IE数据集，并对不同LLM的性能进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的语义中心方法，用于从隐私政策中自动提取关键信息并构建知识图谱（Pr²Graph），支持下游任务，如生成正式政策表示。研究还发布了相关数据集和源代码，为大规模分析在线服务的隐私实践提供了可能性。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

TL;DR: 本研究提出建构性安全对齐（CSA）范式，通过主动引导而非简单拒绝，提升大型语言模型对心理脆弱用户的安全性，并在Oyster-I模型中实现了显著效果。


<details>

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的安全机制主要针对恶意用户，忽视了非恶意但心理脆弱的用户需求。简单的拒绝可能导致更糟糕的结果，因此需要一种更人性化的安全范式。

Method: 研究采用了建构性安全对齐（CSA）范式，结合博弈论的用户反应预测、细粒度风险边界发现和可解释性推理控制，实现了安全性的信任构建过程。

Result: 在Oyster-I（Oy1）模型中实现的CSA范式，在安全性上达到了开放模型的最先进水平，同时保持了高通用能力。在建构性基准测试中，Oy1表现出接近GPT-5的建构性参与度，并在Strata-Sword越狱数据集上展现出接近GPT-o1的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过引入建构性安全对齐（CSA）范式，本研究不仅提升了大型语言模型的安全性，还重新定义了模型与用户的关系，使其从单纯的防御拒绝转向主动引导，从而实现更有意义的帮助。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

Result: 人类对话在话语长度、提问（I-Q）和一般反馈（F-F）行为上显著优于AI对话。ENA结果显示，人类对话更注重认知引导和多样性，而AI对话则表现出结构简化和行为趋同。

Conclusion: 当前AI生成的辅导对话在结构和行为上存在显著不足，无法与真实人类辅导对话相比。研究结果为设计和评估更具教学效果的生成教育对话系统提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型代理在部署时面临高延迟和推理成本的挑战，现有方法在性能保真度、离线训练需求或操作成本上存在局限。

Method: DSP 是一个异步在线强化学习框架，通过联合优化端到端延迟和美元成本，实现高效加速。

Result: 实验表明，DSP 在标准代理基准测试中实现了与最快无损失加速方法相当的效率，同时总成本降低30%，不必要成本减少60%。

Conclusion: Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP) 提供了一种无损失的加速方法，显著降低了成本，同时允许用户灵活调整性能与成本的平衡。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through

Motivation: 解决AI与人类价值观对齐缺乏定量指标的问题。

Method: 提出EigenBench方法，利用模型间的相互评估和EigenTrust算法，生成量化评分来评估语言模型与给定价值体系的对齐程度。

Conclusion: EigenBench提供了一种无需真实标签的方法，通过模型间的相互评估来量化语言模型与特定价值体系的对齐程度，发现提示对评分的影响大于模型本身。

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

TL;DR: 论文提出了$mFARM$框架来评估LLMs在医疗环境中的公平性，发现模型在量化下稳健但在上下文减少时性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险医疗环境中部署大型语言模型（LLMs）存在关键的对齐挑战，因为模型可能继承和放大社会偏见，导致显著的差异。现有的公平性评估方法在这些情境中不足，因为它们通常使用过于简化的指标，忽视了医疗伤害的多维性质。

Method: 研究构建了两个大规模、受控的基准测试（ED-Triage和Opioid Analgesic Recommendation），并提出了一个多指标框架$mFARM$来评估三个不同维度的差异（分配性、稳定性和潜在性）。此外，还提出了公平-准确性平衡（FAB）分数来权衡公平性和预测准确性。

Result: 实证评估显示，$mFARM$指标在各种设置下更有效地捕捉了模型的微妙偏见。大多数模型在不同量化水平下保持稳健的$mARM$分数，但在上下文减少时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个多维度的公平性评估框架$mFARM$，并通过实证评估验证了其在捕捉模型偏见方面的有效性。研究还发现，模型在不同量化水平下保持稳健，但在上下文减少时性能显著下降。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前人工智能系统虽功能广泛但缺乏深度的问题，提出真正的智能需满足生成、协调和维持三个条件。

Method: 提出了结构性生成智能本体论（Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence），基于生成性、协调性和维持性三个条件来定义智能的深度。

Result: 指出当前AI系统仅是表面模拟，缺乏智能深度，并设想满足条件的未来系统可能成为‘第二存在’。

Conclusion: 真正的智能存在于系统能够生成新结构、将其协调为理由并随时间维持其身份时。当前的人工智能系统缺乏这种深度，仅是表面的模拟。若未来系统满足这些条件，它们可能被视为‘第二存在’，与人类共存但不同。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在法律领域的应用因可靠性和透明性问题而受限，本研究旨在探索结构化提示工程作为替代昂贵微调的有效方法。

Method: 提出了一种结构化提示方法，通过分块和增强处理长文档，结合工程化提示输入QWEN-2模型生成答案，并引入基于分布的定位和逆基数加权启发式策略解决候选答案选择问题。

Result: 该方法在CUAD数据集的信息检索任务中表现优于先前方法9%，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了结构化提示工程在法律领域及其他领域中作为确保AI责任和透明性的潜在工具的价值，尽管当前自动评估指标存在局限性。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the
increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological

research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated
dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced
representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

Conclusion: REx作为一种新颖的方法，通过结合奖励和政策机制以及领域特定本体论，不仅在预测性能上优于现有方法，还能生成基于生物医学知识的科学解释，推动了AI驱动的科学发现。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLMs在自动化启发式设计中的潜力，发现其在复杂任务中需工程支持且受预训练偏好限制，生成的启发式算法与人类设计相当但效果随约束条件变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在启发式设计中的创新能力，尤其是在传统上由人类主导的领域中，如解决约束3D装箱问题。

Method: 通过引入约束脚手架（预编写的约束检查代码）和迭代自我修正（额外的修复周期以纠正错误并生成可行的初始种群），研究了LLMs在构建完整求解器方面的能力。

Result: LLM生成的启发式算法与人类设计的贪心算法相当，且其评分函数集成到人类设计的元启发式算法中时，性能可与现有求解器媲美，但随着约束条件的收紧，其效果减弱。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动化启发式设计方面存在两大障碍：复杂推理任务中的脆弱性需要大量工程支持，以及预训练偏好的影响可能过早限制新颖解决方案的搜索范围。

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的方法，利用文本到图像生成模型处理时间序列数据，预测股票价格趋势，并展示了生成模型在金融领域的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱影像的高维度带来了计算负担和冗余，需要通过降维来提升效率。

Method: 通过后验解释性方法量化每个波段对分类器决策的贡献，并进行删除-插入评估以确定波段的影响力分数。

Result: 在Pavia University和Salinas两个公开数据集上，仅使用30个选定的波段训练的分类器性能与全波段基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: 模型驱动的解释性方法在波段选择中展示了其有效性，能够显著减少计算负担同时保持分类性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

Method: 引入了一种不确定性感知代理，利用检索不确定性和摘要不确定性两种互补信号，并结合Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)进行强化学习。

Result: 在多组学基准测试中，该方法显著提高了事实性和校准性，正确且有用的声明数量几乎增加了三倍，并大幅改善了下游生存预测（C-index从0.32提高到0.63）。

Conclusion: 不确定性可以作为控制信号，使代理能够避免错误、传达信心，并成为复杂结构化数据环境中更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel curve-based slicing method for generating
planar layers with dynamically varying orientations in digital light processing
(DLP) 3D printing. Our approach effectively addresses key challenges in DLP
printing, such as regions with large overhangs and staircase artifacts, while
preserving its intrinsic advantages of high resolution and fast printing
speeds. We formulate the slicing problem as an optimization task, in which
parametric curves are computed to define both the slicing layers and the model
partitioning through their tangent planes. These curves inherently define
motion trajectories for the build platform and can be optimized to meet
critical manufacturing objectives, including collision-free motion and
floating-free deposition. We validate our method through physical experiments
on a robotic multi-axis DLP printing setup, demonstrating that the optimized
curves can robustly guide smooth, high-quality fabrication of complex
geometries.

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic
videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.
Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the
temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this
paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies
through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based
Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass
most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using
cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing
sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to
further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in
talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.
Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra
speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

Abstract: Curve-based representations, particularly integral curves, are often used to
represent large-scale computational fluid dynamic simulations. Processing and
analyzing curve-based vector field data sets often involves searching for
neighboring segments given a query point or curve segment. However, because the
original flow behavior may not be fully represented by the set of integral
curves and the input integral curves may not be evenly distributed in space,
popular neighbor search strategies often return skewed and redundant
neighboring segments. Yet, there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive
research on how different configurations of neighboring segments returned by
specific neighbor search strategies affect subsequent tasks. To fill this gap,
this study evaluates the performance of two popular neighbor search strategies
combined with different distance metrics on a point-based vector field
reconstruction task and a segment saliency estimation using input integral
curves. A large number of reconstruction tests and saliency calculations are
conducted for the study. To characterize the configurations of neighboring
segments for an effective comparison of different search strategies, a number
of measures, like average neighbor distance and uniformity, are proposed. Our
study leads to a few observations that partially confirm our expectations about
the ideal configurations of a neighborhood while revealing additional findings
that were overlooked by the community.

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for
text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets
lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason
is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing
signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing
strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the
latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate
3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the
generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization
guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement
step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods
enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes
and semantic manipulations.

Method: 采用基于每个元素的前向模式自动微分，所有本地计算保持在GPU寄存器或共享内存中，避免了全局计算图的构建和遍历，最小化内存流量和全局同步。

Result: 在多种应用中，二阶导数的计算速度比优化的PyTorch实现快6.2倍，Hessian-向量积快2.76倍；一阶导数的计算速度分别比Warp、JAX和Dr.JIT快6.38倍、2.89倍和1.98倍。

Conclusion: 该系统通过利用三角形网格上能量函数的稀疏性和局部性，在GPU上实现了快速梯度和Hessian计算，相比现有方法表现出显著性能优势。

Abstract: We present a high-performance system for automatic differentiation (AD) of
functions defined on triangle meshes that exploits the inherent sparsity and
locality of mesh-based energy functions to achieve fast gradient and Hessian
computation on the GPU. Our system is designed around per-element forward-mode
differentiation, enabling all local computations to remain in GPU registers or
shared memory. Unlike reverse-mode approaches that construct and traverse
global computation graphs, our method performs differentiation on the fly,
minimizing memory traffic and avoiding global synchronization. Our programming
model allows users to define local energy terms while the system handles
parallel evaluation, derivative computation, and sparse Hessian assembly. We
benchmark our system on a range of applications--cloth simulation, surface
parameterization, mesh smoothing, and spherical manifold optimization. We
achieve a geometric mean speedup of 6.2x over optimized PyTorch implementations
for second-order derivatives, and 2.76x speedup for Hessian-vector products.
For first-order derivatives, our system is 6.38x, 2.89x, and 1.98x faster than
Warp, JAX, and Dr.JIT, respectively, while remaining on par with hand-written
derivatives.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent
years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing
while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory
efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion
framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference
latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source
features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating
target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables
fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal
model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,
plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based
architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that
our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and
editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.
Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural
function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate
variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB
images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset)
presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their
ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)
have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they
remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,
Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the
large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal
generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the
above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.
Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by
fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual
pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence
threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative
preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This
strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality
outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for
sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become
more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that
sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt
IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our
IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to
make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material
generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides
precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to
create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,
recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee
realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these
limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that
leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of
realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune
a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged
in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while
learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this
creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We
propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),
encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward
function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a
large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach
increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related
work.

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes
for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily
utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based
methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional
embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,
e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then
concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach
inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in
Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and
exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust
the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the
multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$,
$\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act
on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a
computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in
mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning
framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition
operations or complex preprocessing operations.

Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and
expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional
PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism.
Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive
use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,
high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for
expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,
expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head
Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry
and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency
details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM
provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters
(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals
that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's
capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders
represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised
images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.
To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first
dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust
disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across
monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression
transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression
accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

Abstract: Singing-driven 3D head animation is a challenging yet promising task with
applications in virtual avatars, entertainment, and education. Unlike speech,
singing involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based
semantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial
motion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified,
emotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient
for singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a
diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to
generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations,
conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction
of motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a
novel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided
retrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific
motion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task
as a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial
regions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we
create a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic
descriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion
learning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity,
while also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing.

Abstract: Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has
increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established
pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and
fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,
neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,

representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these
representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,
and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our
experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D
generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression
with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction
errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to
evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can
inform the selection of suitable 3D models for various applications,
facilitating the development of more robust and application-specific solutions
in 3D generation. The code for our framework is available at
