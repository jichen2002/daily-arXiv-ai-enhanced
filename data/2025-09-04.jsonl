Recent\ntrends show that the required energy for these datacenters will rise over time,\nor at least remain constant. Hence, the scientific community developed\ndifferent algorithms, architectures, and approaches for improving the energy\nefficiency of cloud datacenters, which are summarized under the umbrella term\nGreen Cloud computing. In this paper, we use an economic approach - taxes - for\nreducing the energy consumption of datacenters. We developed a tax model called\nGreenCloud tax, which penalizes energy-inefficient datacenters while fostering\ndatacenters that are energy-efficient. Hence, providers running\nenergy-efficient datacenters are able to offer cheaper prices to consumers,\nwhich consequently leads to a shift of workloads from energy-inefficient\ndatacenters to energy-efficient datacenters. The GreenCloud tax approach was\nimplemented using the simulation environment CloudSim. We applied real data\nsets published in the SPEC benchmark for the executed simulation scenarios,\nwhich we used for evaluating the GreenCloud tax."}

However, training these models at\nunprecedented scales requires extensive AI accelerator clusters and\nsophisticated parallelism strategies, which pose significant challenges in\nmaintaining system reliability over prolonged training periods. A major concern\nis the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and\nsoftware failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a\nfast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1)\nActive and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous\ntraining state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and\nsoftware failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)\nScale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for\nnormal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group\nreconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains\nnearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery\nwithin one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,\ncompletely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and\ntheir associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery\nto achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective\n(RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration\nLLM training.

We show how to move unbounded waits\noutside the library itself, enabling synchronous interaction among processes\nwithout the need for polling. Second, we show how the bounded time requirement\ncan be leveraged to achieve lower and more stable latency for inter-process\ninteractions. Third, we observe that prior work on protected libraries is\nvulnerable to a buffer unmapping attack; we prevent this attack by preventing\napplications from removing pages that they share with the protected library.\nFourth, we show how a trusted daemon can respond to asynchronous events and\ndynamically divide work with application threads in a protected library.\n  By extending and improving the protected library model, our work provides a\nnew way to structure OS services, combining the advantages of kernel bypass and\nmicrokernels.

This paper presents a new\napproach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess\nLLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We\npresent a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,\nand GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID\nprinciples. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240\nmanually validated code examples.

Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with\nGPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with\nchallenging principles like DIP.

While their\nextension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video\ncaptioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In\nthis work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in\npixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based\non natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,\nMoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging\nthe interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by\nstatic appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We\nfurther establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or\noutperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation\ntechniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.\nOur motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models\nto improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within\nvideos.

This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations.

Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding.

Existing\nsolutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific\nprogramming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across\nall five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new\napproach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess\nLLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We\npresent a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,\nand GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID\nprinciples. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240\nmanually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct\nprompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and\nchain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection\naccuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with\nGPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with\nchallenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a\ndramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a\ndeliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE\nprompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection\naccuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply\nwith increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that\neffective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a\ntailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific\ndesign context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability\nthrough AI-assisted code analysis."}

A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories", "comment": null, "summary": "The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for\ndata-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its\nvalidity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary\npost-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of\ntrajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}

However, the modalities available in\nclinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area\nthat stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular\nsubtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized\ntreatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable\nand loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from\nvarious modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,\nand histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our\nprimary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily\naccommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down\nwith minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,\nmaking it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a\ndual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional\nimage-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach\nresults in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new\nmultimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance\nacross a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that\nintegrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health\nrecords, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping."}
