Here, we present a physics-inspired\ncooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the\ndissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a\ndecentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous\nformation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of\nexplicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended\npayload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to\nenergy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control\nsystem is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors\nof the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches\nunder the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and\npayload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying\nrobots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success\nrate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,\nand 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor\nwinds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges\nswarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable\nframework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex\ntransportation tasks in communication-constrained environments."}

We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an\nintermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a\nreasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.\nOur method executes in the body-part text space with much higher\ninterpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving\npotential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to\nnew styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive\nexperiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized\nmotion generation."}

Previously, researchers\nhave proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these\nvulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but\nlack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper,\nwe propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify\nvulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular,\nVulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM)\nto prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it\nretrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate\nreasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning\nanalysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of\nVulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that\nVulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the\nvulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is\nimbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and\n+10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.\nFurthermore, VulRTex has been applied to identify 30 emerging vulnerabilities\nacross 10 representative OSS projects in 2024's GitHub IRs, and 11 of them are\nsuccessfully assigned CVE-IDs, which illustrates VulRTex's practicality."}

The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary\nsource of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift\ncaused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the\nrobot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and\nLevenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting\nmethods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as\nstochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and\nresults of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail\nwith experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot."}

We first benchmark\nstate-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet\nis built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)\nmodule and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature\nrepresentation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic\ninformation. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to\nproduce more accurate predictions.

To address these issues, we\npropose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative\nimages and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive\nnegative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance\nfar-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the\nin-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that\nare visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning\ncapability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to\nthis subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD\ndetection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an\nadaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task\nsettings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior\nknowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments.

While UMs can also\nsupport broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus\non the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding\nand generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a\nmodel that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is\npreserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in\ntraining; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and\nevaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in\ncross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many\nalternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong\nsingle-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary\ncomplement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics\nto consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of\ntheir shared representations.

Applied to twelve historic\nquarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,\ncolor theme analysis, and sentiment mining.

Most of the existing\napproaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,\napproximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering\ntechniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have\napplied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,\nbut they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is\nknown to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters\nin the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal\nPerlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of\nnatural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create\nHeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of\nheterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal\nPerlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a\nlearning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed\nheterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.\nInstead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses\nlearnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We\nevaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the\nHeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source\nrealistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its\neffectiveness for inverse scattering.
