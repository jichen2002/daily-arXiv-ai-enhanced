However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality\nstylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style\nconsistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic\ncorrespondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while\nmaintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style\ntransfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D\nrepresentation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views.\nTherefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized\nmulti-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned\ndepth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared\nattention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism,\nwhich effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally,\ninspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth\nmaps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among\nstylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced\nWasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image\nregions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models.

These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as\ncustomer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,\nreduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In\nthis paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice\nAI agent from a corpus of call recordings.

We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt\nengineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech\nrecognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech\nsynthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated\nagainst human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product\ncommunication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing.

Recognizing that accurate\nuncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe\nfeedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of\nzero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets.

This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where\nrobots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate\nresponses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer\n(MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop\nscenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural\npointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing\ngestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and\nidentifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can\naccurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling\nintuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the\nperformance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the\nmodel's predictions across candidate object locations.

Recognizing that accurate\nuncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe\nfeedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of\nzero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding\nfeedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the\nzonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and\nhardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and\na convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a\nROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides\nstable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,\nsignificantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms\nof both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance."}

World models have found broad\napplications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,\nentertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will\neffectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information\nabout the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has\nenabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged\nadvanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent\nadvances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on\nuser instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing\nLatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that\nstreamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld\nleverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering\nengine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed\nframework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal\ninputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,\nfeaturing competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics\nsimulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene\nlayout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a\n$90\\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high\ncreative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality\nstylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style\nconsistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic\ncorrespondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while\nmaintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style\ntransfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D\nrepresentation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views.\nTherefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized\nmulti-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned\ndepth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared\nattention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism,\nwhich effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally,\ninspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth\nmaps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among\nstylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced\nWasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image\nregions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that\nthis optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables\nthe mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene.\nExperimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that\nour pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization."}
