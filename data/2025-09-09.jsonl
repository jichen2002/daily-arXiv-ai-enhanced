However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit\na few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation,\na major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation.\nSecond, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need\nto perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of\nsharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can\ntake minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in\npractice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh\noptimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel\nre-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and\nintersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles;\n(2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free\nguarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the\nsimplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by\nre-meshing and recovering the original sharp features.

This study overcomes\nthis challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of\nsuch networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the\nspinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and\nprescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts\nthe network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex\nlocations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into\narcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into\nprintable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D\nnetworks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)\nautomatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening\nprocess.

For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on\nreal-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to\nfail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector\ncoupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.\nWe evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide\nqualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the\npotential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles."}

To harness these new capabilities while ensuring\ntrustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in\nthe Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE\nfor Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational\npillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest\ndifferently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to\nsupport this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command\ncenter where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such\nas Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The\nAgent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform\ntasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex\ntrade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated\nhuman callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering\nactivities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating\nthe practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This\npaper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision,\noutlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper\nculminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and\nopportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on\nSE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a\nconceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide\ndialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric\ntenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future."}

This approach preserves geometric properties\nwhile enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce\nIndependent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and\nextend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated\non image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,\nDOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves\nhigher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to\nexisting convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN\ndemonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion\nCNNs in this downstream task.

While prior research has\nprimarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a\ndestination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot\nneeds to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact\nenergy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the\nObject-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses\nenergy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one\nof many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,\nwe first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a\nvariant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit\neach pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from\nhigh computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To\nmitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages\nmultiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to\nour solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of\nthe Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints. We\ndemonstrate that PCPD significantly reduces branching factors during search,\nimproving overall performance. Although the concurrent PCPD search may produce\nslightly suboptimal solutions, extensive experiments on real-world datasets\nshow it achieves near-optimal performance while being one to two orders of\nmagnitude faster than the baseline algorithm."}

However, in geometrically degenerate or narrow environments,\nregistration problems become ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions and\ndegraded accuracy. While existing approaches attempt to handle these issues,\nthey fail to address the core challenge: accurately detection, interpret, and\nresolve this ill-conditioning, leading to missed detections or corrupted\nsolutions. In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that\nsystematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through\nthree integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning\ndetection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix.\nThis technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and\ntranslational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy\npatterns in conventional analyses. Second, within these cleanly subspaces, we\ndevelop quantitative characterization techniques that establish explicit\nmappings between mathematical eigenspaces and physical motion directions,\nproviding actionable insights about which specific motions lack constraints.\nFinally, leveraging this clean subspace, we design a targeted mitigation\nstrategy: a novel preconditioner that selectively stabilizes only the\nidentified ill-conditioned directions while preserving all well-constrained\ninformation in observable space. This enables efficient and robust optimization\nvia the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with a single physical\ninterpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at\nleast 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup\nover state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments.

Our key contributions are:\n(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which\nsupports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and\nunstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into\nstandardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs\nintegrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate\nlightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three\nanonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,\nde-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize\nresponse latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier\ncaching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,\nand cloud inference cache.

For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on\nreal-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to\nfail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector\ncoupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.\nWe evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide\nqualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the\npotential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles."}

This\nlimitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple\nplausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert\nvariability.

This study overcomes\nthis challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of\nsuch networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the\nspinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and\nprescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts\nthe network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex\nlocations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into\narcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into\nprintable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D\nnetworks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)\nautomatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening\nprocess.

We propose\na real-time path planning framework that couples an analytic geometry global\nplanner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers, one based on rules\nand one based on reinforcement learning, to handle sudden moving obstacles.\nUsing real-time imaging, the system estimates the positions of the microrobot,\nobstacles, and targets and computes collision-free motions. In simulation, AGP\nyields shorter paths and faster planning than weighted A* (WA*), particle swarm\noptimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), while maintaining\nfeasibility and determinism. We extend AGP from 2D to 3D without loss of speed.\nIn both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local\ncontrollers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. The average\nplanning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps image acquisition and\nreal-time closed-loop control. These results advance autonomous microrobot\nnavigation and targeted drug delivery in vascular environments."}

The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth\nmodule for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for\nboundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale\nattention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a\nFocaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.\nExperiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR\nachieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to\ncompetitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,\nwhile incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the\nVisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed\napproach.

In this work, we propose a\nnovel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation\nproblem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly\nsimplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic\ndescriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each\nimage patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce\nimage-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of\nsegmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling\npipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding\n(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of\nsemantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\\times$, without\ncompromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg\nachieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.\nTo further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic\ndescriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and\nrepresents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks.

However, existing body models have\nsimplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint\nlocations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their\npotential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating\nbiomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion\ncapture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a\nparametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure\nthat can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL\nbody model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data\nof skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.\n  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons\ninside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL\nmesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we\nre-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting\nSKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and\nbiomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more\nbiomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside\nthe body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes\nwe are able to \"upgrade\" existing human pose and shape datasets to include\nbiomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in\nthe wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better\nconstrained and more realistic model of human articulation.

Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from\nautoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in\ntext generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a\nseries of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for\nrobot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present\nLLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon\npretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to\nrobotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token\nclassification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with\nspecial action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a\nhierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences\nhierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots."}

To\novercome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion\nmodels, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic\ndata offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data\ngeneration as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address\nthis, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer\narchitecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective\nlearning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over\nstandard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.\nAs a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and\ncross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple\nbenchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models\npredominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to\nshort-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,\nwe introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual\nforesight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a\nMixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,\nforesight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,\nand actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to\nsynthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By\nforecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation\nas a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that\nimplicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable\ncapabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset\ncomprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training\nscheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual\nforesight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments.

Neural\nmotion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop\ndirectly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or\ndynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural\nmotion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic\nenvironments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is\nIMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million\ngenerated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios.
