### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++是一种改进的标签平滑方法，通过考虑非目标类别的相互关系，提升了模型的泛化能力和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑方法虽然提升了模型的泛化能力，但忽视了非目标类别之间的相互关系，导致信息损失。

Method: 提出了一种新的标签正则化训练策略Label Smoothing++，该方法固定目标类别的标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签及其相互关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Label Smoothing++能够有效减少过度自信的预测，同时促进类别间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类别间关系，有效缓解了过拟合和过度自信问题，同时提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AKD框架通过动态调整alpha和CAM模块，提升了知识蒸馏的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏使用固定平衡因子alpha，无法适应训练过程中硬标签和软监督的最优权衡变化，导致性能次优。

Method: 1. 将alpha作为可学习参数动态优化；2. 基于学生-教师差异动态计算alpha；3. 引入MLP+Attention的上下文感知模块（CAM）自适应重加权教师输出。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，以ResNet-50为教师、ResNet-18为学生模型，AKD框架在准确率和收敛稳定性上均优于固定权重基线。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应知识蒸馏（AKD）框架通过动态调整平衡因子alpha和引入上下文感知模块（CAM），显著提升了学生模型的准确性和训练稳定性，优于传统的固定权重知识蒸馏方法。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

signals at 200 Hz and emotion labels, enabling video-EEG alignment and
advancing multimodal research. This framework offers novel tools for emotion
analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with
substantial research and engineering significance.

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究比较了三种边缘中心度量（FRC、ORC、EBC）在RWNNs剪枝中的效果，发现FRC在保持性能的同时计算效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索网络拓扑结构对深度学习的影响，以及如何通过边缘中心度量优化和剪枝RWNNs，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 本研究通过三种边缘中心网络度量（FRC、ORC和EBC）对RWNNs进行剪枝，并在三种网络生成器（ER、WS和BA模型）上进行比较分析。

Result: FRC在剪枝效果上与ORC相当，但计算效率更高，且剪枝后的网络在压缩比和理论加速方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于FRC的剪枝方法能有效简化RWNNs，提供显著的计算优势，同时保持与ORC相当的性能。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Method: 提出了一种针对爵士乐主旋律谱的OMR模型，讨论了特定于此类数据的标记化选择，并利用合成乐谱和预训练模型的优势。

Result: 构建了一个包含293份手写爵士乐主旋律谱的数据集，并开发了相应的OMR模型。

Conclusion: 本文公开了所有代码、数据和模型，为手写爵士乐主旋律谱的光学音乐识别（OMR）提供了新的数据集和模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过生成合成数据集和两阶段Re-Thinking方案，显著提升了物体识别模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中，现代物体识别模型常因域偏移导致准确率大幅下降。为解决这一问题，提出了RT-VLM框架。

Method: RT-VLM框架包括一个独特的合成数据集生成管道和参数高效的监督调优Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct模型。在推理时执行两阶段Re-Thinking方案。

Result: 在隔离个体域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM始终优于强基线。

Conclusion: RT-VLM框架通过整合结构化多模态证据与显式自我批判循环，为可靠且可迁移的视觉理解提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Method: 采用自定义训练的YOLOv5模型进行羽毛球检测，结合卡尔曼滤波器实现鲁棒的轨迹跟踪，并通过视频运动学速度估计方法计算羽毛球速度。

Result: 系统成功实现了从标准视频中自动计算羽毛球速度的功能，并集成到直观的移动应用中。

Conclusion: 本研究通过智能手机技术开发了一种低成本、用户友好的羽毛球扣杀速度测量系统，为业余和休闲运动员提供了高性能分析工具。

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究构建了一个大规模汉字手写数据库和升级版工具箱，发现语言成分在字符、部首和笔画层面对书写有层级性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言成分（如语音、语义和正字法系统）如何影响汉字书写在字符、部首和笔画层面的表现，并填补缺乏综合性工具来捕获和处理细粒度手写数据的空白。

Method: 构建了一个大规模手写数据库，42名中文母语者每人书写1200个汉字，并升级了OpenHandWrite_Toolbox，用于捕获和处理笔画级手写轨迹。

Result: 多元回归分析显示，正字法预测因子在字符、部首和笔画层面影响书写准备和执行，语音因素也在所有三个层面影响执行，且这些词汇效应呈现层级衰减。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，汉字书写在部首和笔画层面与语言成分密切相关，为未来的心理语言学和神经语言学研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合DGNN和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测跌倒并分析瞬态状态，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在跌倒检测方面取得了显著进展，但跌倒前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未得到探索。

Method: 提出了一种结合动态图神经网络（DGNN）和长短期记忆网络（LSTM）的混合模型，解耦了运动预测和步态分类任务，利用实时骨骼特征作为输入。

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上训练和验证，模型在预测误差和识别准确率上优于仅依赖DGNN的模型和文献中的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务的方法相比仅使用DGNN的统一问题处理，显著提高了性能，并且能够监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

*Dibya Jyoti Bora,Mrinal Kanti Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究比较了K-Means和FCM在脑肿瘤MRI分割中的表现，发现K-Means更快，FCM更准确，但计算成本更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤的准确分割对临床决策、放疗计划和疾病长期监测至关重要，但由于肿瘤形态和强度分布的异质性，这仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 研究采用了硬聚类（K-Means）和软聚类（FCM）两种主要聚类范式，并在BraTS2020数据集上进行了实验验证，包括高斯滤波和CLAHE预处理。评估指标包括Dice相似系数和处理时间。

Result: K-Means的平均运行时间为0.3秒/图像，FCM的平均DSC为0.67（K-Means为0.43），但计算成本更高（1.3秒/图像）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在计算效率和边界精度之间存在的固有权衡，K-Means在速度上表现更优，而FCM在分割准确性上更胜一筹。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

TL;DR: DVRF 是一种无需反演的路径感知编辑框架，通过显式建模速度场差异和时间依赖偏移，显著提升文本到图像编辑的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有蒸馏采样方法中普遍存在的过度平滑问题，并提升文本到图像编辑的质量和可控性。

Method: DVRF 是一种基于蒸馏的方法，显式建模源和目标速度场之间的差异，并引入时间依赖的偏移项以增强目标分布对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，DVRF 在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DVRF 在无需架构修改的情况下，实现了卓越的编辑质量、保真度和可控性，适用于广泛的文本到图像编辑任务。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 通过将注意力机制整合到五种CNN架构中，显著提升了医学图像分析的性能，特别是在EfficientNetB5上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在医学图像分析中难以捕捉细粒度和复杂特征，限制了准确诊断的能力。

Method: 在五种CNN架构（VGG16、ResNet18、InceptionV3、DenseNet121和EfficientNetB5）中集成了Squeeze and Excitation块或混合Convolutional Block Attention Module，以自适应地重新校准通道和空间特征表示。

Conclusion: 本研究通过系统地将注意力机制整合到五种广泛采用的CNN架构中，显著提升了医学图像分析的性能。特别是带有混合注意力的EfficientNetB5表现最佳，为开发稳健、可解释且临床适用的深度学习决策支持系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of defects and contaminants in solar panels is
critical for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of photovoltaic
systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet,
EfficientDet, and Swin Transformer, for identifying physical and electrical
defects as well as surface contaminants such as dust, dirt, and bird droppings
on solar panels. A custom dataset, annotated in the COCO format and
specifically designed for solar panel defect and contamination detection, was
developed alongside a user interface to train and evaluate the models. The
performance of each model is assessed and compared based on mean Average
Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and inference speed. The results
demonstrate the trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational
efficiency, highlighting the relative strengths and limitations of each model.
These findings provide valuable guidance for selecting appropriate detection
approaches in practical solar panel monitoring and maintenance scenarios.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于小波的频率感知变分自编码器（FA-VAE）框架，通过显式解耦低频和高频组件的优化，改善了当前潜在标记器在纹理细节重建上的不足，提升了图像生成的感知质量。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Conclusion: Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning 提供了一种高效且确定性的单次剪枝框架，显著降低了模型复杂度，同时保持了高准确率，为边缘和移动平台的高效部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Result: 研究发现不存在通用的最优冻结策略，而是取决于数据特性。例如，冻结主干网络适用于保留通用特征，而较浅的冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡。这些配置在减少GPU内存消耗的同时，某些情况下甚至超越了完整微调的精度。

Conclusion: 本研究为资源受限环境中的YOLO架构提供了实用的、基于证据的层冻结策略选择指南，通过实证分析展示了不同冻结配置对模型性能和GPU内存消耗的影响。

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN展示了在资源受限的机器人系统中部署的潜力，特别是在需要旋转感知的任务中，同时也适用于其他领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Conclusion: DuoCLR网络通过对比学习任务（CPC和ROR）显著提升了动作分割性能，实验验证了其优于现有方法的效果，并通过消融研究证明了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: RED网络通过模态特定的解耦表示和鲁棒性导向的扰动策略，在合成和真实数据集上均实现了最先进的去模糊性能。

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的分离式3D高斯头像重建与重演框架在单张肖像图像输入下，通过大规模一次性高斯头像生成器和两阶段训练方法，显著提升了泛化能力和高频纹理重建效果。此外，超轻量级高斯头像驱动实现了高帧率渲染，并在实验中证明了其优于当前最先进方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Deepfake检测方法受限于现有数据集的多样性不足，无法应对真实场景中的挑战。

Method: 提出了多维人脸伪造图像（MFFI）数据集，基于四个策略维度增强真实性：1）更广泛的伪造方法；2）多样化的面部场景；3）多样化的真实数据；4）多级退化操作。

Result: MFFI集成了50种不同的伪造方法，包含1024K图像样本，在场景复杂性、跨域泛化能力和检测难度梯度上优于现有公共数据集。

Conclusion: MFFI数据集在模拟真实世界条件方面展现了技术先进性和实用性，验证了其在场景复杂性、跨域泛化能力和检测难度梯度上的优势。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注帧间的全局关联，忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频内容的关联，且语言引导的视频摘要需要更全面的语义理解。

Method: 提出递归时空图网络（VideoGraph），将对象和帧分别建模为空间和时间图的节点，并通过语义关系连接节点。

Result: VideoGraph在多个基准测试中，无论是监督还是无监督设置下，均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VideoGraph通过语言引导的时空图建模在视频摘要任务中取得了最先进的性能，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过自监督学习将语义知识转移到密集特征空间的方法，采用PaKA对齐特征分布，并在密集视觉任务中取得了最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集表示对于需要空间精度和细粒度细节的视觉任务至关重要。现有的自监督表示学习方法多关注全局表示，难以捕捉密集预测任务所需的局部语义。

Method: 提出了一个框架，通过额外的自监督学习在预训练表示基础上构建，旨在将现有语义知识转移到密集特征空间。具体引入了Patch-level Kernel Alignment（PaKA）目标，对齐教师和学生模型的密集特征分布。

Result: 在多个密集视觉基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过Patch-level Kernel Alignment（PaKA）和专门设计的增强策略，在多个密集视觉基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA通过结合局部和全局信息的智能令牌修剪方法，在VLA模型中实现了高效加速且几乎不影响任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅利用当前动作的局部信息修剪令牌，忽略了历史动作的全局上下文，导致任务成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限。观察到连续动作间的高相似性，提出结合局部和全局信息优化令牌选择。

Method: 提出了一种无训练的SpecPrune-VLA方法，包含静态和动态两级修剪以及轻量级动作感知控制器。静态修剪基于全局历史和局部上下文减少视觉令牌；动态修剪根据每层重要性进一步减少令牌；控制器通过动作分类调整修剪强度。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，SpecPrune-VLA在NVIDIA A800和RTX 3090上分别实现1.46倍和1.57倍的加速，相比OpenVLA-OFT，成功率损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: SpecPrune-VLA通过结合局部和全局信息进行智能令牌选择，显著提升了计算效率，同时保持了任务成功率，为VLA模型的加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuMa是一种新型子空间映射方法，专为鲁棒且有效地擦除狭窄概念设计，实验证明其在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法在鲁棒性和有效性上存在不足，尤其难以处理狭窄概念（如版权角色或名人），这在解决版权和法律问题时至关重要。

Method: SuMa首先推导出表示待擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化距离的参考子空间来中和该概念。

Result: SuMa在子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除和实例擦除等任务中表现优异，图像质量与专注于有效性的方法相当，擦除效果与追求完整性的方法相当。

Conclusion: SuMa方法通过子空间映射实现了对狭窄概念的鲁棒擦除，同时保持了图像质量，在多个任务中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

Motivation: 解决高光谱图像在有限或无标签情况下的分析挑战，提升精准农业中的树木表征效果。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法，从航空高光谱图像中提取植被属性相关的神经网络嵌入。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于植被属性相关嵌入空间的树木表示在下游机器学习任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过自监督学习构建的植被属性相关嵌入空间，在后续机器学习任务中表现优于直接使用高光谱植被属性作为树木表示。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

Motivation: 由于非孟加拉数据集训练的车辆检测系统难以准确识别当地车辆类型，本研究旨在填补这一技术空白，推动发展中国家自动驾驶技术的发展。

Method: 研究评估了六种YOLO模型变体在包含29种本地车辆类别的自定义数据集上的表现，数据集通过手机摄像头采集并手动标注。

Result: YOLOv11x表现最佳，达到63.7% mAP@0.5，但推理时间较长（45.8毫秒/图像）。中型变体（YOLOv8m、YOLOv11m）在性能与速度间取得平衡。稀有车辆类别（如Construction Vehicles、Desi Nosimons）检测准确率接近零。

Conclusion: 本研究为针对孟加拉国交通条件的鲁棒物体检测系统开发奠定了基础，填补了通用预训练模型在发展中国家自动驾驶技术中的不足。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

Motivation: 现有字符编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往会出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。EditIDv2旨在解决这些问题，专注于高复杂性叙事场景和长文本输入。

Result: EditIDv2在IBench评估中表现出色，能够实现深度多层次的语义编辑，同时保持身份一致性，满足长提示和高质量图像生成的需求。

Conclusion: EditIDv2通过最小数据润滑下的可编辑性注入、PerceiverAttention的分解、ID损失与扩散模型的联合动态训练以及离线融合策略，在复杂叙事环境中实现了深度多层次的语义编辑，同时保持了身份一致性，满足了长提示和高质量图像生成的需求，并在IBench评估中取得了优异结果。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，缺乏常识知识整合，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法（OOTSM），首先利用LLM预测对象的出现和消失，再生成详细的人-物关系。

Result: OOTSM在短期和长期预测中均表现优异，短期mean-Recall (@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall (@50)提升21.9%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为OOTSM的新方法，通过分阶段利用大型语言模型（LLM）来预测场景图中的对象和关系，显著提升了短期和长期预测的准确性。

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

Motivation: 解决当前LVLMs在多轮交互中存在的推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉问题。

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU)和Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG)机制，结合多级推理集成策略。

Result: 在VisDial、A-OKVQA和MTIF数据集上取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: CAMVR框架通过引入VCMU和AVFG机制，显著提升了LVLMs在多轮视觉-文本推理任务中的性能，实现了最先进的成果。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: MeshMetrics 是一个基于网格的框架，解决了图像分割中距离度量实现的可靠性问题，提供更高精度的计算，并通过开源工具促进可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割研究的可重复性危机中，度量实现的可靠性问题尚未得到足够关注。现有工具在距离度量实现中的缺陷导致了显著的不一致性。

Method: 作者提出了 MeshMetrics，一个基于网格的框架，用于更精确地计算距离度量。通过理论分析和实证验证，证明了其相对于现有工具的高准确性和精度。

Result: MeshMetrics 在准确性和精度上优于现有工具，且受离散化伪影（如距离量化）的影响显著降低。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics 提供了一个比传统网格方法更精确的距离度量计算框架，有效解决了现有工具中的离散化伪影问题，并通过开源实现促进了研究的可重复性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

Motivation: 传统方法在处理多样化的视频数据时，往往难以实现深层次的语义理解、复杂的上下文信息和细粒度的区分。本文受到大型语言模型强大能力的启发，旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为LVLM-VAR的新框架，利用预训练的视觉-语言大模型（LVLMs）进行视频动作识别。方法包括Video-to-Semantic-Tokens（VST）模块，将原始视频序列转换为离散的、语义和时间一致的“语义动作令牌”，并通过LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）处理这些令牌和自然语言指令，以实现动作分类和语义推理。

Result: LVLM-VAR在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等具有挑战性的基准测试中，实现了最先进或极具竞争力的性能（例如，NTU RGB+D X-Sub的94.1%和NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set的90.0%），并通过生成自然语言解释显著提升了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR通过结合预训练的视觉-语言大模型（LVLMs）和创新的视频到语义令牌（VST）模块，显著提升了视频动作识别的准确性和可解释性，并在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Conclusion: 通过结合RGB和法线图像的几何结构信息，JRN-Geo网络在跨视角地理定位任务中表现出色，特别是在处理复杂视角变化时，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态融合中时间一致性的问题，提升雷达/声纳到LiDAR翻译的时空一致性，从而改善SLAM性能。

Method: 论文提出了三种贡献：(i) 时间嵌入相似性对齐连续潜在空间，(ii) 运动对齐变换损失匹配预测与真实LiDAR位移，(iii) 专用时间模块的窗口时间融合。此外，模型架构更新以更好地保留空间结构。

Result: 评估显示，LiDAR-BIND-T在雷达/声纳到LiDAR的翻译中提升了时空一致性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，并提高了Cartographer-based SLAM的占用地图准确性。

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T通过引入时间一致性机制，显著提升了多模态融合的时空一致性，从而提高了下游SLAM的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Conclusion: Multi-LVI-SAM 框架通过全景视觉特征模型和多传感器数据融合，显著提高了状态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，优于现有系统。

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种距离自适应的超分辨率框架，通过理论分析和深度条件卷积，显著提升了深度变化场景的性能，并在传统基准上保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图像超分辨率方法假设空间不变的退化模型，而现实成像系统表现出复杂的距离依赖效应，需要空间自适应的重建策略。

Method: 采用变分框架，将超分辨率视为空间变化的逆问题，通过深度条件卷积核的级联残差块实现离散梯度流动力学，结合学习到的距离自适应正则化项。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在KITTI户外场景的2倍和4倍放大上分别达到36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM，优于现有方法0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了首个理论基础的、距离自适应的超分辨率框架，在深度变化场景中表现出显著改进，同时在传统基准上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Motivation: 当前方法在处理复杂、组合性描述时依赖于整体视觉-语言融合，效果不佳。PARSE-VOS旨在通过层次化、从粗到细的推理解决静态文本与动态视觉内容对齐的挑战。

Method: PARSE-VOS是一个无需训练的框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行从粗到细的层次推理。它包括三个主要模块：自然语言查询解析为结构化语义命令、时空基础模块生成候选轨迹，以及层次识别模块通过两阶段推理（粗粒度运动推理和细粒度姿态验证）选择正确目标。

Result: PARSE-VOS在Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS在三个主要基准测试（Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS）上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病需要严格的药物依从性以避免病情恶化，但患者行为、医疗成本等因素常导致依从性不足。因此，开发一个能够通过视频监测药物依从性的模型具有重要价值。

Method: 提出AdCare-VLM，一个基于Video-LLaVA的多模态大视觉语言模型，用于通过患者视频进行视觉问答（VQA）。使用806个标注的结核病药物监测视频数据集进行微调，并开发了LLM-TB-VQA数据集。

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM通过整合视觉-语言表示，显著提升了药物依从性监测的准确性，并在实验中优于现有模型。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

Conclusion: 本文希望通过PictOBI-20k数据集促进未来面向甲骨文的大型多模态模型（LMMs）的视觉注意力评估和优化。

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种高效的方法来调整现有模型以适应特定目标，显著提高了重建精度和预测方差，且无需访问原始训练数据。

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PointPillars虽高效，但在3D结构保留和两阶段检测流程适配方面存在局限。

Method: 提出了3DPillars CNN架构和RoI头部模块，通过2D卷积高效学习3D体素特征，并利用稀疏场景特征模块增强上下文信息。

Result: 提出的框架缩小了PointPillars与最先进方法的性能差距，同时保持了效率。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，该方法在KITTI和Waymo Open数据集上取得了良好的速度与准确性平衡。

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: CRAB模型通过结合相机和雷达数据，有效减少了深度模糊性，提升了3D物体检测和分割的性能，在nuScenes数据集上达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Method: 使用3D卷积网络从NASA的Terra和Aqua（MODIS）的36个波段加上分裂热波段中学习模式，以区分沙尘与云和地表特征。简单的归一化和局部填充处理缺失数据。改进版本将训练速度提高了21倍，并支持快速处理完整场景。

Result: 在17个独立的MODIS场景上，模型的准确率约为0.92，均方误差为0.014。地图显示在羽流核心区域有很强的一致性，大多数遗漏发生在边缘。

Conclusion: 联合波段和空间学习可以在全球范围内提供及时的沙尘警报；使用更宽的输入窗口或基于注意力的模型可能进一步锐化边缘。

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and
RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of
multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在双时相变化分析中通过直接拼接处理图像对，未能充分建模时间关联和空间语义变化，限制了变化理解的视觉语义对齐效果。

Method: 设计Change Extraction模块以捕捉图像对中的时间特征和空间语义变化，并引入Prompt Augmentation机制以增强模型对空间细节的关注。

Conclusion: BTCChat通过提出Change Extraction模块和Prompt Augmentation机制，显著提升了双时相卫星图像的理解能力，并在变化描述和视觉问答任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高机器人采集的海底视觉图像的高通量解释效率，以增强海洋监测和探索的效率。

Method: 评估了六种最先进的SSL框架，包括CNN和ViT模型，采用不同维度的潜在空间表示，并在三个不同的海底图像数据集上进行测试。

Result: 位置正则化显著提升了SSL的下游分类性能，CNN和ViT的平均F1分数分别提高了4.9±4.0%和6.3±8.9%。高维ViTs表现出强大的泛化能力，与最佳位置正则化SSL性能相当。

Conclusion: 研究发现位置元数据对于自监督学习（SSL）的正则化具有重要价值，尤其是在使用低维潜在表示时。同时，高维ViTs在海底图像分析中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂环境中因依赖单一数据类型而不可靠，亟需一种多模态框架来提升肌肉骨骼风险的早期评估能力。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块与轻量级Transformer块，并引入FGAM和MGCM模块，实现多模态数据的精细特征提取与对齐。

Result: ViSK-GAT在验证和测试集上分别达到93.55%和93.89%的准确率，多项指标优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型通过结合视觉和骨骼坐标数据，显著提升了肌肉骨骼风险的分类性能，为运动中的早期干预提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长续航和海底驻留AUV能力的提升，需要实时解释海底图像以支持自适应任务和优化通信效率，但现有离线方法无法满足实时需求。

Method: 引入了一种在线聚类框架（OCF），能够在实时数据流上无监督地分析海底图像，支持动态聚类合并与分割，且无需重新处理完整历史数据。

Result: OCF在三个海底图像数据集上平均F1得分为0.68，计算时间随数据量增加保持稳定且较低，优于其他在线聚类方法。

Conclusion: OCF框架在实时、无监督的海底图像分析中表现出色，具有较高的聚类准确性和计算效率，适用于长期自主海洋探索任务。

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴应用更注重语义保留而非像素级重建，且需在多样数据分布和下游任务中保持鲁棒性能，这要求先进的语义压缩范式。

Method: 基于对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）模型，提出了一种新颖的语义压缩方法，将CLIP特征嵌入压缩为最小比特。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在基准数据集上保持了语义完整性，平均比特率约为2-3*10(-3)比特/像素，低于主流图像压缩方法所需比特率的5%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过压缩CLIP特征嵌入而非像素级重建，在极低比特率下保持了语义完整性，并在多样数据分布和下游任务中表现出零样本鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Motivation: 当前深度文本提示方法存在两个关键限制：过度依赖对比学习目标忽视细粒度特征优化，以及静态提示无法适应不同输入类别。

Method: 提出AttriPrompt框架，包括属性检索模块、双流对比学习和自正则化机制，利用CLIP视觉编码器的中间层特征优化文本语义表示。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，AttriPrompt优于现有方法，基础到新类别设置下最高提升7.37%。

Conclusion: AttriPrompt通过引入属性检索模块和双流对比学习，显著提升了模型性能，并在跨领域知识转移中表现出色，使其成为更实用的视觉-语言预训练解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Conclusion: 该系统在实验室和真实雨林环境中均表现出色，为无人机在复杂自然环境中的轻量级、集成化和鲁棒性感知与数据收集铺平了道路。

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Conclusion: 通过提出的Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS)方法，成功解决了SDE采样过程中引入的噪声问题，从而提升了奖励建模的准确性，并促进了强化学习优化器的更快、更稳定收敛。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Conclusion: 提出的双交互融合模块（DIFM）和多尺度边界损失显著提高了医学图像分割的准确性，特别是在处理噪声、模糊和低对比度图像时。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Motivation: 高精度3D物体检测模型因计算和内存需求大而难以部署，需开发轻量高效的框架。

Method: 提出Strip Attention Block（SAB），通过分解标准2D卷积为非对称条带卷积，降低计算复杂度；设计硬件友好的分层主干网络，结合深度可分离卷积和简单多尺度融合策略。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，StripDet仅用0.65M参数即达到79.97% mAP，优于基线模型PointPillars（参数减少7倍），并超越其他轻量化和知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: StripDet通过新颖的Strip Attention Block（SAB）和硬件友好的分层主干网络，实现了高效的3D物体检测，在KITTI数据集上表现出色，参数仅为0.65M，mAP达到79.97%，优于现有轻量化和知识蒸馏方法。

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical
solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

Method: 提出了两种基于神经网络的绽放光照方法：Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) 和 Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL)，分别关注质量和性能。

Result: 测试表明，FastNBL比现有技术快28%，NBL快12%，同时保持高质量的光照效果。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的NBL和FastNBL方法在实时生成高质量绽放光照效果方面优于现有技术，显著提升了性能，为实时渲染领域带来了重要的技术进步。

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Motivation: 当前大多数方法受通用2D视觉领域设计的影响，缺乏对3D空间知识学习过程的直观展示，导致医学可解释性不足。自监督技术因其能够缓解医疗领域数据稀缺问题而日益普及。

Method: 提出了一种由三个子任务组成的方法，用于捕捉医学3D成像中的空间相关语义，设计遵循可观察原则以确保可解释性，并尽可能减少由此引起的性能损失。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持与现有方法相当性能的同时，提供了对自监督学习过程的直观理解，增强了医学3D成像的可解释性。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将艺术风格迁移重新定义为数据问题，通过去风格化从艺术作品中移除风格元素以恢复自然的无风格内容，从而生成大规模数据集DST-100K。

Method: 开发了DST（文本引导的去风格化模型）和DST-Filter（多阶段评估模型），通过Chain-of-Thought推理自动筛除低质量数据对，确保内容保真和风格准确性。基于FLUX.1-dev训练了简单的前馈模型OmniStyle2。

Conclusion: OmniStyle2通过去风格化方法生成的大规模数据集DST-100K，为艺术风格迁移提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了缺乏真实数据的根本挑战。

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ConstStyle方法，通过统一域映射减少域偏移影响，显著提升模型在未见域上的泛化能力，尤其在训练域有限时效果突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时性能下降。现有域泛化方法在处理有限训练域或已知域与未见域间差距较大时表现不佳。作者假设，模型需要在与未见测试域相似的域上训练，但由于缺乏未见域的先验知识，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种名为ConstStyle的新方法，通过将样本映射到一个统一的域来捕获域不变特征，并通过理论分析弥合域差距。训练时优化统一域以适应已知域，测试时将未见域样本类似投影后再进行预测。

Result: 大量实验表明，ConstStyle在多种场景下均优于现有方法。特别是在训练域有限的情况下，ConstStyle的准确率可比次优方法提升高达19.82%。

Conclusion: ConstStyle通过将训练和测试数据映射到一个统一的域中，有效减少了域偏移的影响，显著提升了模型在未见域上的性能，尤其在训练域有限的情况下表现尤为突出。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像处理任务中展现出强大的生成能力，但稀疏视图CT重建仍面临信息缺失和分布不一致的挑战，因此需要一种能够有效学习缺失投影视图完成和全局信息建模的方法。

Method: 设计了一种联合训练机制，由稀疏条件概率引导，结合时间变化的稀疏条件重新加权策略和线性回归校正分布偏移，构建了双网络并行架构进行全局校正和优化。

Result: 在公共和真实数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在PSNR上提升了2.58 dB，SSIM提高了2.37%，MSE降低了0.236，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的STRIDE模型在稀疏视图CT重建中表现出色，通过实验验证了其在PSNR、SSIM和MSE指标上的显著提升，重建图像在结构一致性、细节恢复和伪影抑制方面具有优异的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Motivation: 单目3D目标检测由于输入为单张2D图像，缺乏深度信息，导致深度估计问题病态。现有方法依赖卷积神经网络或Transformer架构进行特征提取，但缺乏对输入数据的深入理解。

Method: 采用解耦策略，将预计算的语义分割信息先验注入并直接融合到特征空间中，以指导检测，而不扩展检测模型或联合学习先验。

Result: 在KITTI 3D目标检测基准上，该方法优于仅依赖RGB图像特征的等效架构，尤其在小物体（行人和骑行者）上表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过引入预计算的语义分割信息先验并将其直接融合到特征空间中，该方法在不扩展检测模型或联合学习先验的情况下，显著提升了单目3D目标检测的性能，尤其是在小物体（如行人和骑行者）上。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Motivation: 现有姿态估计方法主要依赖静态单图像关键点定位，未能充分利用太空任务中的时空信息。

Method: 结合了Vision Transformer (ViT)编码器的图像特征与预训练光流模型的运动线索，通过运动感知热图和光流捕捉动态信息，再使用PnP求解器恢复6-DoF姿态。

Result: 在SPADES-RGB和SPARK-2024数据集上验证，该方法在2D关键点定位和6-DoF姿态估计上均优于单图像基线，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法在单目6-DoF姿态估计中表现出色，尤其在利用时空信息方面优于传统单图像方法，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中，BLaVe-CoT表现优于现有方法，对模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BLaVe-CoT框架通过多答案推理和链式思维模块，有效应对BLV用户视觉问答中的模糊性，提升了VQA系统在辅助场景中的鲁棒性和包容性。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Conclusion: 本研究通过提出UAV-Label引擎、构建大规模数据集UAVDE-2M和UAVCAP-15k，并结合新型CAGE模块，显著提升了无人机图像中的开放词汇目标检测性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV

engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

Motivation: 现有方法在微表情识别中存在手工特征依赖关键帧或深度学习数据不足的问题，需要一种更有效的动态信息捕捉方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的细粒度动态感知（FDP）框架，包括局部-全局特征感知变换器、排序评分器和动态表示共享模块。

Conclusion: FDP框架显著提升了微表情识别的性能，并在动态图像构建任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini
2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of
100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the
limited dataset size.

TL;DR: TinyDef-DETR通过细节保留下采样和双域注意力等方法，显著提升了无人机小缺陷检测的性能，计算开销适中且泛化能力强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机传输线路自动检测中，小且模糊的缺陷在复杂背景下难以检测，现有检测器存在细节丢失、边界敏感性不足和全局与局部信息整合不充分的问题。

Method: 提出了TinyDef-DETR框架，包括无步长的空间到深度模块、边缘增强卷积、跨阶段双域多尺度注意力模块和Focaler-Wise-SIoU回归损失。

Result: 在CSG-ADCD数据集上，TinyDef-DETR在精度和召回率上均有显著提升，特别是在小物体子集上表现突出，同时计算开销适中。VisDrone基准测试进一步验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 整合细节保留的下采样、边缘敏感表示、双域注意力和难度自适应回归，为基于无人机的小缺陷检测提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Conclusion: BranchGRPO通过引入分支采样策略、树型优势估计器和剪枝策略，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能，实验证明其在图像和视频偏好对齐任务中优于现有基线。

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Motivation: 高保真CFD建模依赖专家物理模型、精细网格和密集计算，限制了快速迭代。数据驱动模型（尤其是GNN）为直接从模拟数据中学习热流体行为提供了新途径，但传统GNN难以捕捉高分辨率图结构中的长程依赖关系。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新颖的多阶段GNN架构，用于在网格流体动力学模拟中建模复杂的热传递，相比现有技术展现出更高的预测准确性、训练效率和减少的长期误差积累。

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: We introduce Home-made Diffusion Model (HDM), an efficient yet powerful
text-to-image diffusion model optimized for training (and inferring) on
consumer-grade hardware. HDM achieves competitive 1024x1024 generation quality
while maintaining a remarkably low training cost of $535-620 using four RTX5090

Motivation: 提升投影式纳米和微米断层扫描中图像的重建质量，特别是针对由均匀材料相和锐利边缘组成的样本。

Method: 通过训练神经网络识别子图像中的边缘，并将其整合到数学优化模型中，以减少先前重建中的伪影。优化方法倾向于根据学习预测选择解决方案，但也可能根据原始数据强烈支持选择替代方案。

Result: 在实验数据集上，相比基准算法，该技术在界面锐度和材料均匀性方面显示出显著提升。

Conclusion: 该技术成功整合了样本的均匀性和锐利边缘知识，消除了模糊，显著提升了断层成像技术的重建质量。

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

TL;DR: MedSeqFT是一种顺序微调框架，通过MDS和K&G RFT组件提升医学图像分割性能，平均Dice提高3.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调策略在利用共享知识和增量任务集成方面存在局限，需要一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了MedSeqFT框架，包含两个核心组件：最大数据相似性（MDS）选择和基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案（K&G RFT）。

Result: 在十个3D分割任务上表现优于现有方法，平均Dice得分提高了3.0%，并在未见任务上验证了其迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedSeqFT作为一种有效的顺序微调框架，能够适应不断变化的临床任务，同时保留预训练知识，显著提高了分割任务的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Motivation: 病理图像分析的准确性对自动化肿瘤诊断至关重要，但由于组织图像的高结构相似性和细微形态变化，现有视觉语言模型难以捕捉所需的复杂推理。

Method: 引入PathoHR-Bench基准测试，并设计了一种病理特异性视觉语言训练方案，通过生成增强和扰动样本进行多模态对比学习。

Result: 实验结果揭示现有视觉语言模型无法有效建模复杂的跨模态关系，限制了其在临床环境中的适用性。

Conclusion: 提出的病理特异性视觉语言训练方案在PathoHR-Bench和六个额外病理数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在细粒度病理表示中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

Motivation: 自动图像聚类在图像增强中的应用受限，主要因难以定义对该任务有意义的聚类。

Method: 引入CARDIE无监督算法，基于颜色和亮度内容聚类图像，并提出量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE生成的聚类比基于语义图像属性的聚类更相关于图像增强，并能用于重采样图像增强数据集，提升色调映射和去噪算法性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE算法通过颜色和亮度内容聚类图像，为图像增强任务提供了更相关的聚类结果，并公开代码以促进采用和可重复性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测和城市规划中具有互补性，但现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D，一种基于3D shifted-window transformer的模型，利用级联训练策略和优化的波段序列设计，从5个多光谱波段重建224个高光谱波段。

Result: 模型PSNR达35.82 dB，SAM为2.40°，SSIM为0.96，优于基线MHF-Net（PSNR提升+5.6 dB，ERGAS减少一半以上），并在下游任务中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D 是一种基于Transformer的模型，能够从多光谱输入生成高光谱图像，同时保持空间和光谱质量。通过级联训练策略和优化的波段序列设计，显著提升了重建性能，并在下游任务中展示了实用价值。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI与医学图像结合提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）的能力增强，隐私风险随之上升。未经授权使用眼底图像可能导致生物信息泄露，侵犯个人隐私。因此，研究提出了RetinaGuard来解决这一隐私问题。

Method: RetinaGuard 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多样化的替代年龄编码器，实现对黑盒年龄预测模型的通用防御。

Result: 综合评估表明，RetinaGuard 成功混淆了视网膜年龄预测，同时对图像质量和病理特征表示的影响最小。

Conclusion: RetinaGuard 是一种有效的隐私增强框架，能够在保护视网膜年龄等敏感生物特征数据的同时，保持医学图像的视觉质量和疾病诊断效用。该框架具有通用性和可扩展性，适用于其他医学图像衍生的生物标志物。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

Conclusion: UniVerse-1模型通过结合预训练的视频和音乐生成专家模型，以及开发的在线标注流程，实现了音频和视频的协调生成，并公开了模型和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常针对粗粒度盒级或细粒度全景像素级VidSGG，需要特定任务架构和多阶段训练流程。UNO旨在通过单阶段统一框架解决这两个任务，最小化任务特定修改并最大化参数共享。

Method: UNO采用扩展的slot attention机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系slot，并引入对象时间一致性学习和动态三元组预测模块，以捕获时间上的交互变化。

Result: UNO在标准盒级和像素级VidSGG基准测试中实现了竞争性能，并通过统一设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO框架在标准盒级和像素级VidSGG基准测试中表现出色，不仅实现了跨任务的竞争性能，还通过统一的、以对象为中心的设计提高了效率。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Motivation: 骨折是全球性健康挑战，尤其在资源匮乏地区，传统成像方法成本高、有辐射且依赖专业解读。因此开发了基于AI的自动骨折检测方案。

Method: 使用自定义卷积神经网络(CNN)并与EfficientNetB0、MobileNetV2和ResNet50等迁移学习模型进行对比。训练基于公开的FracAtlas数据集，包含4,083张匿名肌肉骨骼X光片。

Result: 自定义CNN在FracAtlas数据集上达到95.96%准确率、0.94精确率、0.88召回率和0.91 F1分数。迁移学习模型在此特定设置中表现较差。

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

*Lucas Wojcik,Luiz Coelho,Roger Granada,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效文档检测流程，通过调整IWPOD-Net并在合成数据集上训练，实现了比现有解决方案更小、更高效的模型，同时保持竞争力的OCR质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时文档检测和矫正是文献中较少探索的领域，但这是从视觉文档中自动检索信息的关键步骤。我们致力于构建一个在OCR检索方面表现良好且比其他可用解决方案更高效的文档检测流程。

Method: 我们调整了IWPOD-Net（一个车牌检测网络），并在NBID（合成ID卡数据集）上训练它进行检测。通过数据增强和跨数据集验证（使用MIDV，另一个合成ID和护照文档数据集），寻找模型的最佳场景。

Result: 我们的模型在OCR质量指标上具有竞争力，同时比现有最优解决方案更小、更高效。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使文档矫正不完美，也能达到最优性能。我们的模型在保持竞争力的OCR质量指标的同时，比现有最优解决方案更小、更高效。

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Ego3D-Bench基准和Ego3D-VLM框架，显著提升VLMs在多视角环境中的3D空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在3D空间关系理解上存在局限，尤其是基于自我中心多视角观测的户外数据。

Method: 提出了Ego3D-VLM，一种基于估计全局3D坐标生成认知图的模块化后训练框架。

Result: Ego3D-VLM在多选题QA上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%。

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为提升VLMs在现实世界多视角环境中的空间理解能力提供了有价值的工具，展示了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

*Cecelia Soh,Rizhao Cai,Monalisha Paul,Dennis Sng,Alex Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过智能手机自拍图像远程估计皮肤水合度和经表皮水分流失，提出了一种新颖的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型，并解决了数据标注不平衡问题，为AI驱动的皮肤分析提供了新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤健康和疾病抵抗力与皮肤屏障功能密切相关，但测量皮肤屏障功能的关键指标（皮肤水合度和经表皮水分流失）通常需要专业仪器，普通用户难以便捷获取。本研究旨在通过智能手机自拍图像远程估计这些指标，解决这一可及性问题。

Method: 研究提出了一个系统性解决方案，包括SH/TEWL数据收集、数据预处理以及一个新颖的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型用于SH/TEWL回归。实验中发现SH/TEWL数据的标注不平衡问题，并提出了一种基于对称的对比正则化方法，有效减少了模型偏差。

Result: 研究提出了一个从自拍面部图像估计SH和TEWL的系统性解决方案，并通过实验验证了其有效性，特别是在处理数据标注不平衡问题上。

Conclusion: 本研究首次探索了通过自拍面部图像进行皮肤评估的方法，无需物理测量，为计算机视觉与皮肤护理研究的结合提供了桥梁，使AI驱动的皮肤分析更广泛地应用于现实世界。

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

*Jiangnan Xie,Xiaolong Zheng,Liang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAML是一种新型多模态学习框架，通过改进跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用，显著提升了开放词汇场景下的视觉定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在开放词汇场景中存在局限性，主要源于视觉与语言模态的不完美对齐、跨模态特征融合不足以及语义原型信息利用不充分。

Method: 利用ALBEF进行跨模态对齐，通过视觉判别特征编码器增强显著对象表示，引入原型发现和继承机制，最后通过多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验验证了PAML的竞争力，特别是在开放词汇场景中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PAML框架在标准场景中表现优异，在开放词汇场景中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

### [100] [Video-based Generalized Category Discovery via Memory-Guided Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06306)
*Zhang Jing,Pu Nan,Xie Yu Xiang,Guo Yanming,Lu Qianqi,Zou Shiwei,Yan Jie,Chen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出MCCL框架，通过整合时间和空间线索提升视频广义类别发现性能，实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要关注静态图像中的类别发现，但仅依赖静态视觉内容难以可靠发现新类别。因此，论文将GCD问题扩展到视频领域，提出了Video-GCD新设置，旨在有效整合跨时间的多视角信息。

Method: MCCL框架包含两个核心组件：一致性感知对比学习（CACL）和记忆引导表示增强（MGRE）。CACL利用多视角时间特征估计未标记实例间的一致性得分，用于加权对比损失；MGRE通过双级内存缓冲区维护特征级和逻辑级表示，增强类内紧凑性和类间分离性。

Result: 实验表明，MCCL框架在Video-GCD基准测试中显著优于基于图像设置的竞争方法，验证了时间信息对视频中新类别发现的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新颖的记忆引导一致性感知对比学习框架（MCCL），通过结合时间和空间线索，显著提升了视频广义类别发现（Video-GCD）的性能，并构建了一个新的基准数据集验证其有效性。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

*Jeongmin Yu,Susang Kim,Kisu Lee,Taekyoung Kwon,Won-Yong Shin,Ha Young Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP-FAS结合MVS和MTPA模块，通过多视角文本提升跨域泛化能力，实验表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP-based FAS模型未充分利用CLIP的patch embedding tokens，且依赖单一文本提示，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含Multi-View Slot attention (MVS)和Multi-Text Patch Alignment (MTPA)模块，利用多视角文本生成通用特征。

Result: MVP-FAS在跨域数据集上表现优异，超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过MVS和MTPA模块显著提升了跨域性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Result: Text4Seg++在自然和遥感数据集上的综合实验表明，其在多种基准测试中均优于现有最先进模型，且兼容现有的MLLM架构。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于文本驱动的图像分割方法，通过Text4Seg++模型展示了其有效性、可扩展性和通用性，无需任务特定微调即可在多种基准测试中超越现有最先进模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands

token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Motivation: 现有货币识别系统通常忽略可用性和真实性评估，尤其在资源匮乏环境中，视觉障碍用户和离线验证需求突出。

Method: 提出了一种统一的货币评估框架，包含三个模块：轻量级CNN模型用于面额分类，UCDI指标量化货币损坏，基于特征的模板匹配用于假币检测。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成轻量级CNN模型、新型UCDI指标和基于特征的模板匹配，实现了在资源受限环境中实时、设备上的货币评估，支持包容性货币验证。

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

Motivation: 现有方法通常需要额外训练或依赖外部工具，忽视了VLMs内在的注意力机制潜力。本文旨在利用VLMs自身注意力模式提升性能。

Method: 研究VLMs的注意力模式，提出基于注意力对比的像素级任务相关视觉信号提取方法CARVE。

Result: 实验表明CARVE显著提升性能，开源模型上最高达75%的改进。

Conclusion: CARVE提供了一种无需额外训练的方法，通过对比注意力机制有效提升视觉语言模型在复杂视觉环境中的性能，为视觉推理的改进提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Motivation: 研究FairCLIP（Luo等人，2024）的可复现性，以改善CLIP的群体公平性，并探索其设计选择和影响。

Method: 通过复制Luo等人（2024）的实验设置，研究了FairCLIP的研究发现，并提出了新的实现A-FairCLIP和扩展目标FairCLIP+。

Result: 在哈佛-FairVLMed数据集上的实验不支持FairCLIP能改善CLIP性能和公平性的说法。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，尽管FairCLIP的规范化目标减小了Sinkhorn距离，但官方实现和对齐实现A-FairCLIP在零样本青光眼分类中均未改善性能或公平性。

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Motivation: 假设时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧内接地对象中受益，并通过初步实验验证了这一假设。

Method: 提出GO-Tokenizer，一个轻量级的附加模块，利用现成的目标检测器动态编码紧凑的对象信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用GO-Tokenizer预训练的模型在多个任务和数据集上均优于基线模型及其文本描述增强版本。

Conclusion: 通过引入GO-Tokenizer模块，显著提升了视频大语言模型在时间敏感视频理解任务中的性能，且该方法具有轻量化和通用性。

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

TL;DR: 研究提出CNN-LSTM混合模型，利用多模态图像数据准确分类氮胁迫程度，准确率98%，优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物在自然环境中面临多种交互压力，氮胁迫与干旱和杂草竞争叠加时影响尤为复杂，早期检测对植物健康至关重要。

Method: 研究采用RGB、多光谱和两种红外波长的成像模态，结合CNN提取空间特征和LSTM捕捉时间依赖性，构建时空深度学习管道。

Result: CNN-LSTM模型的准确率达到98%，显著优于仅空间CNN模型的80.45%和其他机器学习方法的76%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的CNN-LSTM混合深度学习框架在复杂多压力环境下准确分类氮胁迫程度，为作物管理提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Method: 提出了一种轻量级语义分割框架 BioLite U-Net，利用深度可分离卷积大幅减少计算负担而不牺牲精度。

Result: BioLite U-Net 在 Raspberry Pi 4B 上实现了 92.85% 的 mIoU 和 96.17% 的 Dice 分数，每帧推理时间为 335 毫秒。

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net 提供了一种在分割精度、效率和可部署性之间更优的权衡，非常适合智能闭环生物打印系统。

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Motivation: 传统单图像超分辨率模型在跨尺度泛化能力上存在局限，限制了其实际应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SAAM通过轻量级的尺度自适应特征提取和上采样，结合SimAM注意力模块和梯度方差损失，增强了图像细节的清晰度。该方法可无缝集成到多种先进超分辨率骨干网络中。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的卷积架构（如U-Net）在全局上下文建模上受限，而集成Transformer的模型计算成本高，不适合实时应用。本研究旨在设计一种轻量级实时分割模型。

Method: 模型采用Swin Transformer类编码器与U-Net类解码器结合，通过Barlow Twins自监督学习方法预训练，再针对特定任务微调。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种轻量级的端到端架构，结合了Swin Transformer类编码器和U-Net类解码器，通过自监督学习预训练和微调，实现了实时医学图像分割的高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

TL;DR: 研究开发了自动化流程分析脑转移瘤的SRS治疗响应，通过聚类和机器学习预测生长轨迹，结果显示出高预测精度，为临床决策支持提供了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑转移瘤（BM）是癌症患者死亡的主要原因之一。由于纵向影像分析的工作量巨大，临床医生通常仅通过观察评估随访图像，缺乏系统的注释和分析。因此，研究旨在通过自动化方法更好地理解生长轨迹并早期预测治疗成功或毒性。

Method: 研究实现了一个自动化流程，用于整理大规模的SRS治疗纵向数据集，包括177名患者的896个BM。通过数据驱动的聚类识别特征性生长轨迹，并使用经典和图形机器学习（GML）方法预测12个月的病变级响应。

Result: 聚类揭示了5种主要生长轨迹，具有不同的最终响应类别。使用梯度提升法仅基于治疗前和首次随访MRI的响应预测AUC高达0.90（CI95%=0.88-0.92）。GML方法同样表现出色，AUC达0.88（CI95%=0.86-0.90），且在多个输入时间点配置中更具灵活性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的自动化流程不仅为脑转移瘤（BM）对立体定向放射外科（SRS）治疗的响应提供了更精确的评估和预测，还为临床决策支持系统奠定了基础，有助于优化个性化治疗。

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

TL;DR: 3DGS在大型场景中面临坐标量化问题，本文提出球坐标量化方案，实验验证其在Garden场景中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在大型场景中，输入视图通常来自有限的空间区域，导致重建仅适用于同一区域内的新视角（3DoF+）。因此，需要解决坐标量化问题以提高投影精度。

Method: 研究了坐标量化问题，分析了位置误差对投影误差（以像素为单位）的影响，并提出了一种基于球坐标的新量化方案。

Result: 实验表明，投影误差与投影点距离的平方成反比，提出的球坐标量化方案在Garden场景中表现出良好的率失真性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于球坐标的新量化方案，以解决3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在大型场景中的坐标量化问题，并通过实验展示了其在Garden场景中的率失真性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight 是一种基于 SAM 和 MLLM 的 VCOD 方法，通过时空特征融合和解耦学习策略，显著提升了伪装物体检测的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态环境中存在两个主要问题：SAM 模型无法分离伪装物体边缘，以及 MLLM 方法因合并前景和背景而导致物体可分性差。

Method: 基于 SAM 和 MLLM 的 Phantom-Insight 方法，通过时空线索表示视频序列，利用 LLM 进行特征融合，并通过动态前景视觉令牌评分模块和提示网络生成多线索，自适应地微调 SAM 模型。此外，采用解耦的前景-背景学习策略，分别生成前景和背景线索并进行解耦训练。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight 在 VCOD 任务中表现出色，不仅在 MoCA-Mask 数据集上达到了最先进的性能，还在 CAD2016 数据集上展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data

TL;DR: DINOv3在医学视觉任务中表现优异，但面对深度专业化领域时性能有限，且扩展性不一致。研究为其作为医学任务基线提供了支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨前沿视觉基础模型（如DINOv3）能否直接作为医学视觉任务的统一编码器，而无需领域特定的预训练。

Method: 报告通过将DINOv3应用于多种医学视觉任务（包括2D/3D分类和分割），并系统地分析其在不同模型规模和输入分辨率下的表现，来评估其作为通用编码器的能力。

Result: DINOv3在多个任务中表现出色，甚至优于某些医学专用基础模型（如BiomedCLIP和CT-Net），但在需要深度领域专业化的任务中性能下降，且其扩展性在医学领域表现不一致。

Conclusion: DINOv3虽然在某些医学视觉任务中表现出色，但面对需要深度领域专业化的场景（如WSIs、EM和PET）时，其性能有所下降。此外，DINOv3在医学领域的扩展性并不一致，性能并不总是随着模型规模或特征分辨率的增加而提升。尽管如此，DINOv3仍为医学视觉任务提供了一个强大的基线，其视觉特征可作为多任务的有力先验。

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过在频域和空间域的协同处理，有效解决了高分辨率遥感图像变化检测中的伪变化和语义鸿沟问题，在多个基准测试中达到了新的最优性能。

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究了场景级草图基于图像检索（SBIR）中真实草图固有的模糊性和噪声问题，提出了一个旨在应对草图变异性的训练目标。

Method: 采用预训练、特定编码器架构和定制的损失函数，设计了一个对草图变异性具有鲁棒性的训练目标。

Result: 在FS-COCO和SketchyCOCO数据集上的广泛实验证实了方法的有效性，并实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过适当的预训练、编码器架构和损失函数组合，无需引入额外复杂性即可实现最先进的性能。实验证实了方法的有效性，并强调了训练设计在跨模态检索任务中的关键作用，以及改进场景级SBIR评估场景的必要性。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出RARL方法解决增量开放集识别问题，通过VII策略和分层校正优化决策边界，实验证明其在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet上性能最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别（OSR）方法通常针对静态场景设计，无法适应连续数据流中新出现的未知类。在增量场景中，由于无法访问历史训练数据，决策边界的区分性难以维持，导致严重的类间混淆。

Method: 论文提出了保留角度表示学习（RARL）方法，包括虚拟-固有交互（VII）训练策略和分层校正策略。VII策略通过边界邻近虚拟类压缩已知表示，分层校正策略则优化决策边界以减少表示偏差和特征空间扭曲。

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上的实验表明，RARL方法在多种任务设置下均达到最先进的性能，并建立了IOSR的新基准。

Conclusion: 论文提出的RARL方法在增量开放集识别（IOSR）中表现出色，通过虚拟-固有交互（VII）训练策略和分层校正策略，有效解决了决策边界模糊和特征空间扭曲问题，在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 论文通过机器学习方法学习近似Condorcet排序的简化排序，为彩色图像定义向量值形态学算子，初步计算实验证实了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归多视角扩散模型解决了非自回归模型在3D新视角合成中的局限性，支持任意输入-输出视角配置，并实现了高质量的视觉输出。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

TL;DR: HSANet通过新颖的注意力机制和混合上采样，有效提升LDCT/PET图像质量，适合临床使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）和PET虽降低了辐射暴露，但增加了噪声和伪影，影响诊断准确性，因此需要有效的去噪方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet)，结合了Efficient Global Attention (EGA)模块和混合上采样模块，以增强空间和通道交互，并减少对噪声的过拟合。

Result: 实验证明HSANet在公开LDCT/PET数据集上优于现有方法，且模型轻量，适合标准内存配置的GPU部署。

Conclusion: HSANet在保持轻量级模型大小的同时，显著提升了LDCT/PET图像的去噪性能，适合实际临床应用。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: VIM-GS结合稀疏SfM深度和密集LFM深度，通过对象分割和动态细化模块，显著提升了大场景中单目图像的新视角合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯溅射（GS）通常依赖RGB-D/立体相机的精确深度信息，但在大场景中深度感知范围有限；单目图像缺乏深度引导，导致NVS效果不佳。LFM虽然可用于单目深度估计，但存在跨帧不一致、远距离场景不准确和纹理误导等问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于对象分割的深度传播算法和动态深度细化模块，结合稀疏SfM深度和密集LFM深度，生成高精度密集深度图。

Result: 实验证明，VIM-GS在公共和定制数据集上均表现出优越的大场景渲染质量。

Conclusion: VIM-GS通过结合视觉-惯性SfM的稀疏深度和大基础模型（LFM）的密集深度，成功解决了大场景中单目图像缺乏深度信息的问题，显著提升了新视角合成（NVS）的渲染质量。

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SIAS方法合成的异常缺乏精细纹理细节，且难以生成像素级异常，STAGE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: STAGE采用了一种新颖的异常推断策略，结合干净背景信息作为先验来引导去噪分布，并使用分级扩散框架和显式掩码对齐策略。

Result: 在MVTec和BTAD数据集上的广泛实验表明，STAGE在SIAS中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: STAGE在SIAS任务中表现出色，显著提升了下游异常分割的性能。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

TL;DR: Zo3T is a zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided I2V generation, improving 3D realism and motion accuracy with innovative techniques like 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection and dynamic LoRA adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for trajectory-guided I2V generation either rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning or yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating misalignment between manipulated latents and noise predictions.

Method: Zo3T introduces three core innovations: 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, and Guidance Field Rectification.

Result: Zo3T enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy, outperforming existing training-based and zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated

Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and

improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we
constructed a deep learning feature extraction network

exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of
model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by
comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other

analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision,
F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer
learning model proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that our model
exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy,
surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection
and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification

Motivation: 事件相机在挑战性光照条件下具有优势，但其高成本、低分辨率和缺乏自动对焦等功能限制了其广泛应用，尤其是在早期开发和原型设计阶段。

Method: 通过直接访问原始Bayer数据并绕过传统图像信号处理器（ISP），利用DVS-Voltmeter模型构建可配置的仿真框架，并在嵌入式平台上部署。

Result: 实验结果表明，Raw2Event生成的事件流与真实事件相机相似，同时具备更高分辨率和自动对焦能力。系统还支持用户直观的参数调整，适应多种应用需求。

Conclusion: Raw2Event提供了一种低成本、高分辨率且支持自动对焦的实时事件生成解决方案，为事件相机的研究和早期系统开发提供了可扩展且经济高效的方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决真实数据集样本量和场景多样性不足的问题，提供高保真合成数据集以增强模型训练效果。

Method: 使用数字孪生技术模拟真实场景的几何、道路对齐及车辆运动模式，生成包含10K标注帧的合成数据集，标注包括3D边界框、实例分割标签、跟踪ID等。

Result: 合成数据集与真实数据在统计和结构上高度相似，仅使用合成数据训练的模型在真实数据上表现优于使用真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: UrbanTwin数据集通过高保真数字孪生技术合成的激光雷达数据集，能够有效增强现有基准数据集，提升深度学习模型在3D物体检测、跟踪及语义和实例分割任务中的性能。

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the
way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

Motivation: 由于人类对脸部更为敏感，现有图像定制方法在保持身份一致性和避免多参考图像身份混淆方面存在挑战，限制了身份的可扩展性。

Method: UMO采用'多对多匹配'范式，将多元身份生成重新定义为全局分配优化问题，并通过在扩散模型上的强化学习来释放多元身份一致性。

Conclusion: UMO通过统一的多元身份优化框架，显著提升了身份一致性并减少了身份混淆，为图像定制方法在身份保持维度上设立了新的开源标准。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

TL;DR: 论文通过对比学习和混合架构（LRCN+注意力）提升视频年龄分类性能，准确率达88%，并部署为实时Web应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频分类方法在标注数据需求大、泛化能力差和特征学习效率低等方面存在不足，难以满足MPAA评级等年龄适宜性标准的自动化需求。

Method: 采用对比学习（实例判别、上下文对比学习和多视图对比学习）结合混合架构（LRCN+CNN+LSTM）和Bahdanau注意力机制，动态优化帧优先级。

Result: 在上下文对比学习框架下，模型达到88%的准确率和0.8815的F1分数，尤其在PG-13与R级内容的区分上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合对比学习和混合架构（LRCN与Bahdanau注意力机制）的方法，显著提升了视频年龄适宜性分类的准确性和适应性，尤其在区分PG-13和R级内容时表现优异。模型通过多种对比损失函数的验证，证明了其鲁棒性，并成功部署为实时分类的Web应用。

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一任务的 AI 辅助放射学解释模型无法覆盖广泛的成像模态、疾病和放射学发现，因此需要一种能够广泛泛化的基础模型。

Method: 研究人员训练了 Curia 基础模型，使用了来自一家大型医院多年的横断面成像数据（150,000 次检查，130 TB），并基于新构建的 19 任务外部验证基准进行评估。

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom
dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and
fine-tuned the open-sourced BiRefNet model on this dataset. This resulted in
marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images,
increasing from 95.3% to 99.5% for our newly introduced Pixel Accuracy metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于现实场景（如多视图重建）中常见的拓扑伪影问题，这些伪影会破坏现有方法（如Functional Maps和ARAP类方法）的假设。

Method: 论文提出了一种拓扑自适应变形模型，结合ARAP和双射关联约束，联合优化模板网格的拓扑结构及其与待匹配形状的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法适用于高度非等距形状和带拓扑伪影的形状，甚至在大规模数据集训练的3D对齐质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种拓扑自适应的变形模型，能够处理包含拓扑伪影的非刚性3D网格匹配问题，并在不依赖数据驱动先验的情况下，显著提高了3D对齐质量。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

### [161] [Intraoperative 2D/3D Registration via Spherical Similarity Learning and Inference-Time Differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06890)
*Minheng Chen,Youyong Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种非欧几里得球形特征空间中的相似性学习方法，通过SO(4)空间中的Riemannian距离近似测地距离，显著提升了2D/3D配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有欧几里得近似方法扭曲了流形结构并减缓了收敛速度，限制了2D/3D配准的准确性和效率。

Method: 采用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，将其投影到球形空间，并在SO(4)空间中使用Riemannian距离近似测地距离。此外，推理阶段使用完全可微的Levenberg-Marquardt优化替代梯度下降。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，该方法在患者特定和患者无关场景中均表现出更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种在非欧几里得球形特征空间中进行相似性学习的新方法，通过Riemannian距离在SO(4)空间中近似测地距离，显著提高了2D/3D配准的准确性和收敛速度。

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

TL;DR: BIR-Adapter是一种低复杂度盲图像修复适配器，利用预训练扩散模型先验，无需额外特征提取器，性能优于现有方法且可扩展应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决盲图像修复中需要训练辅助特征提取器的高复杂度问题，同时充分利用预训练模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用预训练大规模扩散模型的先验知识，通过模型自身提取退化图像的特征，并扩展自注意力机制以利用这些退化特征，同时引入采样引导机制以减少幻觉效应。

Result: 在合成和真实世界退化情况下，BIR-Adapter表现优于或与现有先进方法相当，且复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter通过其适配器设计，显著降低了复杂度，同时保持了与现有先进方法相当或更优的性能，并能够扩展到其他扩散模型中，拓宽了图像修复任务的应用范围。

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

Motivation: 解决通用领域预训练模型在精细、多变的冠层结构和波动田间条件下泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 通过自监督预训练在ImAg4Wheat数据集（包含250万张高分辨率小麦图像）上构建FoMo4Wheat模型。

Conclusion: FoMo4Wheat模型展示了作物特异性基础模型在田间感知中的可靠性，并为跨物种和跨任务的通用作物基础模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

TL;DR: 本文提出s-covers概念，设计线性时间算法测试及寻找最短s-cover，并给出最长s-primitive词长度的指数级上下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究s-covers的计算复杂度，发现其介于标准覆盖和洗牌幂之间，填补了相关领域的空白。

Method: 针对多项式有界整数字母表，设计了线性时间算法来测试候选词是否为s-cover，并寻找最短s-cover。对于常数大小字母表，算法同样保持线性时间复杂度。

Result: 证明了s-covers的计算复杂度较高，但算法上仍可实现线性时间处理。同时，给出了最长s-primitive词长度的指数级上下界。

Conclusion: 本文提出了s-covers和s-primitive的概念，并给出了线性时间算法来测试候选词是否为s-cover以及寻找最短s-cover的方法。此外，还提供了关于最长s-primitive词长度的显式上下界。

Abstract: We introduce subsequence covers (s-covers, in short), a new type of covers of
a word. A word $C$ is an s-cover of a word $S$ if the occurrences of $C$ in $S$
as subsequences cover all the positions in $S$.
  The s-covers seem to be computationally much harder than standard covers of
words (cf. Apostolico et al., Inf. Process. Lett. 1991), but, on the other
hand, much easier than the related shuffle powers (Warmuth and Haussler, J.
Comput. Syst. Sci. 1984).
  We give a linear-time algorithm for testing if a candidate word $C$ is an
s-cover of a word $S$ over a polynomially-bounded integer alphabet. We also
give an algorithm for finding a shortest s-cover of a word $S$, which in the
case of a constant-sized alphabet, also runs in linear time.
  The words without proper s-cover are called s-primitive. We complement our
algorithmic results with explicit lower and an upper bound on the length of a
longest s-primitive word. Both bounds are exponential in the size of the
alphabet. The upper bound presented here improves the bound given in the
conference version of this paper [SPIRE 2022].

*Barış Can Esmer,Dániel Marx*

TL;DR: 论文研究了有界树宽图上的$H$-Packing和$H$-Partition问题，给出了团和非团情况下的时间复杂度上下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究有界树宽图上的$H$-Packing和$H$-Partition问题，旨在理解这些问题的计算复杂性，特别是在不同约束条件下的最优时间复杂度。

Method: 论文采用树分解技术，结合强指数时间假设（SETH）和指数时间假设（ETH），推导了不同情况下$H$-Packing和$H$-Partition问题的时间复杂度上下界。

Result: 对于$H$为团的情况，时间复杂度为$(c+1)^{tw} \cdot n^{O(1)}$；对于$H$非团的情况，时间复杂度可能高达$2^{o(tw \log tw)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$。

Conclusion: 该论文通过研究有界树宽图上的$H$-Packing和$H$-Partition问题，展示了对于不同情况下的时间复杂度上下界，特别是当$H$不是团时，时间复杂度的依赖性可能不是单指数的。

Abstract: $H$-Packing is the problem of finding a maximum number of vertex-disjoint
copies of $H$ in a given graph $G$. $H$-Partition is the special case of
finding a set of vertex-disjoint copies that cover each vertex of $G$ exactly
once. Our goal is to study these problems and some generalizations on
bounded-treewidth graphs. The case of $H$ being a triangle is well understood:
given a tree decomposition of $G$ having treewidth $tw$, the $K_3$-Packing
problem can be solved in time $2^{tw} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, while Lokshtanov et
al.~[{\it ACM Transactions on Algorithms} 2018] showed, under the Strong
Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH), that there is no $(2-\epsilon)^{tw}\cdot
n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for any $\epsilon>0$ even for $K_3$-Partition. Similar
results can be obtained for any other clique $K_d$ for $d\ge 3$. We provide
generalizations in two directions:
  - We consider a generalization of the problem where every vertex can be used
at most $c$ times for some $c\ge 1$. When $H$ is any clique $K_d$ with $d\ge
3$, then we give upper and lower bounds showing that the optimal running time
increases to $(c+1)^{tw}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. We consider two variants depending on
whether a copy of $H$ can be used multiple times in the packing.
  - If $H$ is not a clique, then the dependence of the running time on
treewidth may not be even single exponential. Specifically, we show that if $H$
is any fixed graph where not every 2-connected component is a clique, then
there is no $2^{o({tw}\log {tw})}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for
\textsc{$H$-Partition}, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态规划技术在树分解上的应用是否能够扩展到多目标优化问题的Pareto集计算，以解决如多边形聚合等实际问题。

Method: 论文首先推导了多准则s-t割问题的Pareto集计算算法，并将其应用于多边形聚合问题。随后，扩展到多目标最小生成树问题和多目标TSP问题。算法的时间复杂度为$O(f(w)\cdot\mathrm{poly}(n,p_{\text{max}}))$。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过改进策略和启发式方法，算法能够在树宽度高达22的实例上高效运行，预处理研究还比较了不同树分解的预估总运行时间。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了如何将树分解上的动态规划技术应用于多目标优化问题的Pareto集计算，并通过实验验证了算法的实用性，特别是在多边形聚合问题上的高效表现。

Abstract: Dynamic programming over tree decompositions is a common technique in
parameterized algorithms. In this paper, we study whether this technique can
also be applied to compute Pareto sets of multiobjective optimization problems.
We first derive an algorithm to compute the Pareto set for the multicriteria
s-t cut problem and show how this result can be applied to a polygon
aggregation problem arising in cartography that has recently been introduced by
Rottmann et al. (GIScience 2021). We also show how to apply these techniques to
also compute the Pareto set of the multiobjective minimum spanning tree problem
and for the multiobjective TSP. The running time of our algorithms is
$O(f(w)\cdot\mathrm{poly}(n,p_{\text{max}}))$, where $f$ is some function in
the treewidth $w$, $n$ is the input size, and $p_{\text{max}}$ is an upper
bound on the size of the Pareto sets of the subproblems that occur in the
dynamic program. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of computing
Pareto sets on real-world instances of polygon aggregation problems. For this
matter we devised a task-specific data structure that allows for efficient
storage and modification of large sets of Pareto-optimal solutions. Throughout
the implementation process, we incorporated several improved strategies and
heuristics that significantly reduced both runtime and memory usage, enabling
us to solve instances with treewidth of up to 22 within reasonable amount of
time. Moreover, we conducted a preprocessing study to compare different tree
decompositions in terms of their estimated overall runtime.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种高效的催化对数空间算法，分别用于解决$s\to t$连通性和随机游走模拟问题，显著提升了时间效率和可实现性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图论中$s\to t$连通性和随机游走模拟问题的传统算法时间复杂度较高，且缺乏明确的时间界限。本文旨在提供更高效且易于实现的催化对数空间算法。

Method: 对于$s\to t$连通性问题，随机催化算法的时间复杂度为$\widetilde{O}(nm)$，确定性算法为$\widetilde{O}(n^3 m)$。随机游走模拟算法的时间复杂度为$\widetilde{O}( m T^2 / \varepsilon )$。两种算法均通过顶点寄存器实现。

Result: 随机催化算法首次在$\mathsf{CL}$中使用随机化技术，确定性算法则显著提升了时间效率。随机游走模拟算法能够在给定误差范围内高效估计终点概率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了两种高效的催化对数空间算法，分别用于解决图论中的两个基本问题：$s\to t$连通性和随机游走模拟。前者提供了随机和确定性两种算法，后者则提供了确定性的高效算法。

Abstract: We give fast, simple, and implementable catalytic logspace algorithms for two
fundamental graph problems.
  First, a randomized catalytic algorithm for $s\to t$ connectivity running in
$\widetilde{O}(nm)$ time, and a deterministic catalytic algorithm for the same
running in $\widetilde{O}(n^3 m)$ time. The former algorithm is the first
algorithmic use of randomization in $\mathsf{CL}$. The algorithm uses one
register per vertex and repeatedly ``pushes'' values along the edges in the
graph.
  Second, a deterministic catalytic algorithm for simulating random walks which
in $\widetilde{O}( m T^2 / \varepsilon )$ time estimates the probability a
$T$-step random walk ends at a given vertex within $\varepsilon$ additive
error. The algorithm uses one register for each vertex and increments it at
each visit to ensure repeated visits follow different outgoing edges.
  Prior catalytic algorithms for both problems did not have explicit runtime
bounds beyond being polynomial in $n$.

*Shuai Shao,Ke Shi*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个不依赖SSM的Weitz型FPTAS，用于铁磁Ising模型，通过近似边删除比率而非边际概率，并在一般图上首次证明了随机集群模型的SSM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文的动机是在不依赖强空间混合（SSM）属性的情况下，为铁磁Ising模型在整个Lee-Yang零自由区域提供一个Weitz型FPTAS。

Method: 论文的方法包括使用Weitz的自避游走树，并在对数深度截断以提供高效且良好的近似。关键区别在于近似精心设计的边删除比率，而不是顶点自旋的边际概率，从而确保算法不需要SSM。此外，通过建立局部依赖系数（LDC），证明了这些边删除比率的一种新颖形式的SSM。

Result: 论文的结果包括首次在一般图（非格子）上为随机集群模型建立了SSM结果，并通过新的除法关系证明了LDC的普遍适用性。此外，结合现有的零自由性结果，为多种模型推导了新的SSM结果。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论表明，Weitz型FPTAS和强空间混合（SSM）可以从零自由性中推导出来，而零自由性本身足以支持Weitz型FPTAS，但SSM还需要局部依赖系数（LDC）这一与零自由性无关的组合性质。

Abstract: We present a Weitz-type FPTAS for the ferromagnetic Ising model across the
entire Lee-Yang zero-free region, without relying on the strong spatial mixing
(SSM) property. Our algorithm is Weitz-type for two reasons. First, it
expresses the partition function as a telescoping product of ratios, with the
key being to approximate each ratio. Second, it uses Weitz's self-avoiding walk
tree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient
approximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we
approximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal
probability of a vertex's spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.
  Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we
indeed prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in
turn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model. This is the first
SSM result for the random cluster model on general graphs, beyond lattices. We
prove LDC using a new division relation, and remarkably, such relations hold
quite universally. As a result, we establish LDC for a variety of models.
Combined with existing zero-freeness results for these models, we derive new
SSM results for them. Our work suggests that both Weitz-type FPTASes and SSM
can be derived from zero-freeness, while zero-freeness alone suffices for
Weitz-type FPTASes, SSM additionally requires LDC, a combinatorial property
independent of zero-freeness.

Method: 通过引入最短路径子图的概念，论文展示了从SSPT到UVDST问题的近似保持归约，并利用已有的DST近似算法为SSPT提供了准多项式的polylog近似解。

Result: 研究结果表明SSPT问题是NP-hard的，并提出了一种针对受限图类的多项式polylog近似算法。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了SSPT问题的NP-hard性质，并提出了一种针对特定图类的多项式polylog近似算法。

Abstract: We introduce and study a novel problem of computing a shortest path tree with
a minimum number of non-terminals. It can be viewed as an (unweighted) Steiner
Shortest Path Tree (SSPT) that spans a given set of terminal vertices by
shortest paths from a given source while minimizing the number of nonterminal
vertices included in the tree. This problem is motivated by applications where
shortest-path connections from a source are essential, and where reducing the
number of intermediate vertices helps limit cost, complexity, or overhead. We
show that the SSPT problem is NP-hard. To approximate it, we introduce and
study the shortest path subgraph of a graph. Using it, we show an
approximation-preserving reduction of SSPT to the uniform vertex-weighted
variant of the Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem, termed UVDST. Consequently,
the algorithm of [Grandoni et al., 2023] approximating DST implies a
quasi-polynomial polylog-approximation algorithm for SSPT. We present a
polynomial polylog-approximation algorithm for UVDST, and thus for SSPT, for a
restricted class of graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合位向量实现仅支持秩查询，缺乏对选择查询的支持，这极大地限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出了一种方法，将选择查询支持添加到混合位向量中，并进行了广泛的实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，混合位向量在支持选择查询后，表现出色，速度和空间效率均达到最佳水平。

Conclusion: 混合位向量在支持选择查询后，不仅保持了原有的高效性能，还在速度和空间效率上与现有最快的位向量相媲美。

Abstract: One of the central problems in the design of compressed data structures is
the efficient support for rank and select queries on bitvectors. These two
operations form the backbone of more complex data structures (such as wavelet
trees) used for the compact representation of texts, trees, graphs, or grids.
Their efficient implementation is one of the most frequently studied problems
in compressed data structures.
  One effective solution is the so-called hybrid bitvector implementation,
which partitions the input bitvector into blocks and adaptively selects an
encoding method, such as run-length, plain, or minority encoding, based on
local redundancy. Experiments have shown that hybrid bitvectors achieve
excellent all-around performance on repetitive and non-repetitive inputs.
  However, current implementations support only rank queries (i.e., counting
the number of ones up to a given position) and lack support for select queries.
This limitation significantly restricts their applicability. In this paper, we
propose a method to add support for select queries to hybrid bitvectors, and we
conduct an extensive set of experiments. Our results show that hybrid
bitvectors offer excellent performance, matching the speed of the fastest and
the space efficiency of the most compact existing bitvectors.

Motivation: 密集连接的无线网络中，分布式链路调度算法产生的大量信令开销会加剧拥塞、能耗和无线电足迹扩展等问题，需找到一种减少调度开销的方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于图神经网络的分布式链路稀疏化方案能有效减少无线网络中的调度开销，同时保持网络容量，缓解了网络拥塞和无线电足迹扩展问题。

Abstract: In wireless networks characterized by dense connectivity, the significant
signaling overhead generated by distributed link scheduling algorithms can
exacerbate issues like congestion, energy consumption, and radio footprint
expansion. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a distributed link
sparsification scheme employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to reduce
scheduling overhead for delay-tolerant traffic while maintaining network
capacity. A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for
individual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling
links to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed.
Our approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised}
learning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing
scheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level.
In simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link
sparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces
radio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.

Abstract: As networks evolve towards 6G, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) must
accommodate diverse requirements and at the same time manage rising energy
consumption. Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) networks facilitate dense
cellular deployments with reduced infrastructure complexity. However, the
multi-hop wireless backhauling in IAB networks necessitates proper routing and
resource allocation decisions to meet the performance requirements. At the same
time, cell densification makes energy optimization crucial. This paper
addresses the joint optimization of routing and resource allocation in IAB
networks through two distinct objectives: energy minimization and throughput
maximization. We develop a novel capacity model that links power levels to
achievable data rates. We propose two practical large-scale approaches to solve
the optimization problems and leverage the closed-loop control framework
introduced by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to integrate
the solutions. The approaches are evaluated on diverse scenarios built upon
open data of two months of traffic collected by network operators in the city
of Milan, Italy. Results show that the proposed approaches effectively reduces
number of activated nodes to save energy and achieves approximately 100 Mbps of
minimum data rate per User Equipment (UE) during peak hours of the day using
spectrum within the Frequency Range (FR) 3, or upper midband. The results
validate the practical applicability of our framework for next-generation IAB
network deployment and optimization.

Method: Tiga 将并发控制和共识机制整合，通过同步时钟为事务分配未来时间戳以实现严格可序列化执行和一致复制。在大多数情况下，事务在到达服务器时已按时间戳排序，仅需1 WRTT即可提交；少数情况下通过慢速路径处理。

Result: 评估结果显示，Tiga的性能优于所有基线方法，吞吐量提高1.3-7.2倍，延迟降低1.4-4.6倍。

Conclusion: Tiga 是一种新型的地理复制和可扩展事务数据库设计，能够在大多数情况下以1次广域往返时间（1 WRTT）提交事务，同时在少数情况下通过慢速路径（1.5-2 WRTTs）保证事务完成。其性能优于现有解决方案，具有更高的吞吐量和更低的延迟。

Abstract: This paper presents Tiga, a new design for geo-replicated and scalable
transactional databases such as Google Spanner. Tiga aims to commit
transactions within 1 wide-area roundtrip time, or 1 WRTT, for a wide range of
scenarios, while maintaining high throughput with minimal computational
overhead. Tiga consolidates concurrency control and consensus, completing both
strictly serializable execution and consistent replication in a single round.
It uses synchronized clocks to proactively order transactions by assigning each
a future timestamp at submission. In most cases, transactions arrive at servers
before their future timestamps and are serialized according to the designated
timestamp, requiring 1 WRTT to commit. In rare cases, transactions are delayed
and proactive ordering fails, in which case Tiga falls back to a slow path,
committing in 1.5--2 WRTTs. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, Tiga can
commit more transactions at 1-WRTT latency, and incurs much less throughput
overhead. Evaluation results show that Tiga outperforms all baselines,
achieving 1.3--7.2$\times$ higher throughput and 1.4--4.6$\times$ lower
latency. Tiga is open-sourced at

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出On-Dyn-CDA算法，显著提升车载网络实时任务处理效率，降低延迟和任务丢失率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车载网络中实时任务处理的低延迟和低任务丢弃率是关键挑战，目标是最大化完成任务数量并最小化整体延迟。

Method: 研究比较了静态和动态版本的优化算法，包括在线与离线两种情况。提出了On-Dyn-CDA算法，该算法无需数据集或训练阶段，计算复杂度低。

Result: On-Dyn-CDA在最复杂场景下仅需0.05秒完成执行，而动态PSO需1330.05秒；任务丢失率降低3.42%，平均延迟减少29.22%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新型的在线动态成本驱动算法（On-Dyn-CDA），在实时任务处理中显著优于动态PSO算法，尤其在任务丢失率和平均延迟方面表现突出。

Abstract: Real-time task processing is a critical challenge in vehicular networks,
where achieving low latency and minimizing dropped task ratio depend on
efficient task execution. Our primary objective is to maximize the number of
completed tasks while minimizing overall latency, with a particular focus on
reducing number of dropped tasks. To this end, we investigate both static and
dynamic versions of an optimization algorithm. The static version assumes full
task availability, while the dynamic version manages tasks as they arrive. We
also distinguish between online and offline cases: the online version
incorporates execution time into the offloading decision process, whereas the
offline version excludes it, serving as a theoretical benchmark for optimal
performance. We evaluate our proposed Online Dynamic Cost-Driven Algorithm
(On-Dyn-CDA) against these baselines. Notably, the static Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) baseline assumes all tasks are transferred to the RSU and
processed by the MEC, and its offline version disregards execution time, making
it infeasible for real-time applications despite its optimal performance in
theory. Our novel On-Dyn-CDA completes execution in just 0.05 seconds under the
most complex scenario, compared to 1330.05 seconds required by Dynamic PSO. It
also outperforms Dynamic PSO by 3.42% in task loss and achieves a 29.22%
reduction in average latency in complex scenarios. Furthermore, it requires
neither a dataset nor a training phase, and its low computational complexity
ensures efficiency and scalability in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 传统日志分析方法依赖专家知识或完全监督学习模型，需要大量标记数据和人力。ALPHA旨在解决这些挑战，实现无需人工干预的自动化日志分析。

Result: 在真实世界日志数据集上的实验表明，ALPHA的检测准确性与完全监督方法相当，同时显著减少了人力投入。

Conclusion: ALPHA提出了一种可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，实现了真正自动化的基于日志的异常检测，并支持通过LLM驱动的根本原因解释进行可解释分析。

Abstract: Network log data analysis plays a critical role in detecting security threats
and operational anomalies. Traditional log analysis methods for anomaly
detection and root cause analysis rely heavily on expert knowledge or fully
supervised learning models, both of which require extensive labeled data and
significant human effort. To address these challenges, we propose ALPHA, the
first Active Learning Pipeline for Human-free log Analysis. ALPHA integrates
semantic embedding, clustering-based representative sampling, and large
language model (LLM)-assisted few-shot annotation to automate the anomaly
detection process. The LLM annotated labels are propagated across clusters,
enabling large-scale training of an anomaly detector with minimal supervision.
To enhance the annotation accuracy, we propose a two-step few-shot refinement
strategy that adaptively selects informative prompts based on the LLM's
observed error patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world log datasets
demonstrate that ALPHA achieves detection accuracy comparable to fully
supervised methods while mitigating human efforts in the loop. ALPHA also
supports interpretable analysis through LLM-driven root cause explanations in
the post-detection stage. These capabilities make ALPHA a scalable and
cost-efficient solution for truly automated log-based anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 论文通过公理化分析证明混合策略（如Epsilon-Greedy）在路径选择中平衡性能与稳定性，是下一代网络设计的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究路径感知网络架构与多路径传输协议结合时，个体性能优化与网络整体稳定性之间的权衡。

Method: 通过严格的公理化分析评估了多种算法（贪婪、合作及混合策略）在路径感知环境中的表现。

Result: 纯贪婪策略在低竞争下高效但导致灾难性数据包丢失；合作策略保证公平稳定但未充分利用高容量路径；混合策略（如Epsilon-Greedy）在高竞争场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 可调谐的混合算法（如Epsilon-Greedy）是设计下一代网络稳健高性能路径选择机制的关键。

Abstract: Path-aware networking architectures like SCION provide end-hosts with
explicit control over inter-domain routing, while multipath transport protocols
like MPTCP and MPQUIC enable the concurrent use of multiple paths. This
combination promises significant gains in performance and policy enforcement,
but it also creates a stark trade-off between individual performance
optimization and overall network stability. This paper quantifies this
trade-off through a rigorous axiomatic analysis. We evaluate a spectrum of
algorithms, from greedy (Min-RTT) and cooperative (Round-Robin) to hybrid
approaches (Epsilon-Greedy), against axioms of Efficiency, Loss Avoidance,
Stability, and Fairness in a simulated path-aware environment.
  Our simulations reveal that purely greedy strategies, while efficient under
low contention, induce catastrophic packet loss, increasing by over >18,000% as
the number of competing agents grow, due to herd effects that cause severe
network instability. Conversely, cooperative strategies ensure fairness and
stability but at the cost of underutilizing high-capacity paths. Crucially, we
demonstrate that hybrid strategies resolve this conflict. The Epsilon-Greedy
algorithm, for instance, achieves the highest efficiency of all tested
strategies in high-contention scenarios while mitigating the instability
inherent to the greedy approach. Our axiomatic analysis suggests that tunable,
hybrid algorithms are essential for designing robust and high-performance path
selection mechanisms for next-generation networks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement toward sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks has
significantly intensified the complexity and scale of optimization problems,
including resource allocation and trajectory design, often formulated as
combinatorial problems in large discrete decision spaces. However, traditional
optimization methods, such as heuristics and deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
struggle to meet the demanding requirements of real-time adaptability,
scalability, and dynamic handling of user intents in increasingly heterogeneous
and resource-constrained network environments. Large language models (LLMs)
present a transformative paradigm by enabling natural language-driven problem
formulation, context-aware reasoning, and adaptive solution refinement through
advanced semantic understanding and structured reasoning capabilities. This
paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of LLM-enabled
optimization frameworks tailored for wireless networks. We first introduce
foundational design concepts and distinguish LLM-enabled methods from
conventional optimization paradigms. Subsequently, we critically analyze key
enabling methodologies, including natural language modeling, solver
collaboration, and solution verification processes. Moreover, we explore
representative case studies to demonstrate LLMs' transformative potential in
practical scenarios such as optimization formulation, low-altitude economy
networking, and intent networking. Finally, we discuss current research
challenges, examine prominent open-source frameworks and datasets, and identify
promising future directions to facilitate robust, scalable, and trustworthy
LLM-enabled optimization solutions for next-generation wireless networks.

Motivation: 由于移动网络需要支持严格的服务要求以确保高质量用户体验，而UE资源有限，直接在UE上运行FFNN模型具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种优化框架，将FFNN模型分割为多个部分，由UE、边缘和核心节点执行，以减少UE的计算负担并控制推理时间。同时提供了一种高效的启发式策略来解决优化问题。

Result: 该框架在异构环境中有效，显著减少了UE的计算资源占用。

Conclusion: 该框架在异构环境中表现出鲁棒性，无需重新训练，并将UE的内存（CPU）占用减少了33.6%（60%）。

Abstract: With mobile networks expected to support services with stringent requirements
that ensure high-quality user experience, the ability to apply Feed-Forward
Neural Network (FFNN) models to User Equipment (UE) use cases has become
critical. Given that UEs have limited resources, running FFNNs directly on UEs
is an intrinsically challenging problem. This letter proposes an optimization
framework for split computing applications where an FFNN model is partitioned
into multiple sections, and executed by UEs, edge- and core-located nodes to
reduce the required UE computational footprint while containing the inference
time. An efficient heuristic strategy for solving the optimization problem is
also provided. The proposed framework is shown to be robust in heterogeneous
settings, eliminating the need for retraining and reducing the UE's memory
(CPU) footprint by over 33.6% (60%).

Motivation: 研究AGV在工业环境中的控制问题，尤其是通信网络问题（如延迟或错误）如何导致AGV偏离预定轨迹，从而需要联合通信与控制（JCC）的解决方案。

Method: 通过结合Gazebo和ROS 2构建仿真框架，明确纳入了通信指标（如延迟和丢包）和控制指标（如路径的均方误差）。

Result: 结果表明，网络性能（特别是包接收率PRR）与控制精度之间存在显著相关性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个基于Gazebo和ROS 2的仿真框架，用于模拟和可视化AGV控制与通信网络之间的复杂交互，揭示了网络性能与控制精度之间的相关性。

Abstract: Networked Control System (NCS) is a paradigm where sensors, controllers, and
actuators communicate over a shared network. One promising application of NCS
is the control of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in the industrial
environment, for example to transport goods efficiently and to autonomously
follow predefined paths or routes. In this context, communication and control
are tightly correlated, a paradigm referred to as Joint Communication and
Control (JCC), since network issues such as delays or errors can lead to
significant deviations of the AGVs from the planned trajectory. In this paper,
we present a simulation framework based on Gazebo and Robot Operating System 2
(ROS 2) to simulate and visualize, respectively, the complex interaction
between the control of AGVs and the underlying communication network. This
framework explicitly incorporates communication metrics, such as delay and
packet loss, and control metrics, especially the Mean Squared Error (MSE)
between the optimal/desired and actual path of the AGV in response to driving
commands. Our results shed light into the correlation between the network
performance, particularly Packet Reception Ratio (PRR), and accuracy of
control.

Motivation: 尽管3GPP TS 23.501定义了透明时钟（TC）作为5G同步模式之一，但尚未有在TSN-5G网络中的实证评估。

Method: 在商用TSN交换机上实现5G端到端TC，计算5G中的驻留时间并在从节点恢复时钟域。通过修改PTP消息传输速率在TSN-5G测试床上进行同步评估。

Result: 实验结果显示峰峰值同步为500纳秒，满足工业需求。

Conclusion: 透明时钟（TC）在TSN-5G网络中实现了500纳秒的峰峰值同步，满足工业需求（<1微秒），且对特定PTP消息传输速率具有最小同步偏移。

Abstract: Time synchronization is essential for industrial IoT and Industry 4.0/5.0
applications, but achieving high synchronization accuracy in Time-Sensitive
Networking (TSN)-5G networks is challenging due to jitter and asymmetric
delays. 3GPP TS 23.501 defines three 5G synchronization modes: time-aware
system, boundary clock (BC), and transparent clock (TC), where TC offers a
promising solution. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
empirical evaluation of TC in a TSN-5G network. This paper empirically
evaluates an 5G end-to-end TC in a TSN-5G network, implemented on commercial
TSN switches with a single clock. For TC development, we compute the residence
time in 5G and recover the clock domain at the slave node. We deploy a TSN-5G
testbed with commercial equipment for synchronization evaluation by modifying
the Precision Timing Protocol (PTP) message transmission rates. Experimental
results show a peak-to-peak synchronization of 500 ns, meeting the industrial
requirement of < 1 us, with minimal synchronization offsets for specific PTP
message transmission rates.

Abstract: The Internet, the world's largest and most pervasive network, lacks a
transparent, granular view of its traffic patterns, volumes, and growth trends,
hindering the networking community's understanding of its dynamics. This paper
leverages publicly available Internet Exchange Point traffic statistics to
address this gap, presenting a comprehensive two-year study (2023-2024) from
472 IXPs worldwide, capturing approximately 300 Tbps of peak daily aggregate
traffic by late 2024. Our analysis reveals a 49.2% global traffic increase
(24.5% annualized), uncovers regionally distinct diurnal patterns and
event-driven anomalies, and demonstrates stable utilization rates, reflecting
predictable infrastructure scaling. By analyzing biases and confirming high
self-similarity, we establish IXP traffic as a robust proxy for overall
Internet growth and usage behavior. With transparent, replicable data--covering
87% of the worldwide IXP port capacity--and plans to release our dataset, this
study offers a verifiable foundation for long-term Internet traffic monitoring.
In particular, our findings shed light on the interplay between network design
and function, providing an accessible framework for researchers and operators

Motivation: 隧道中车辆检测对交通监控和事故响应至关重要，但多径反射导致的鬼点问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出了一种多径射线追踪算法，结合地面平面约束和信号路径损耗，恢复复杂的3D反射路径；并引入曲线到平面分割方法简化隧道表面建模。

Conclusion: mmTunnel系统通过纠正多径反射导致的鬼点，显著提高了隧道中远距离车辆检测的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Vehicle detection in tunnels is crucial for traffic monitoring and accident
response, yet remains underexplored. In this paper, we develop mmTunnel, a
millimeter-wave radar system that achieves far-range vehicle detection in
tunnels. The main challenge here is coping with ghost points caused by
multi-path reflections, which lead to severe localization errors and false
alarms. Instead of merely removing ghost points, we propose correcting them to
true vehicle positions by recovering their signal reflection paths, thus
reserving more data points and improving detection performance, even in
occlusion scenarios. However, recovering complex 3D reflection paths from
limited 2D radar points is highly challenging. To address this problem, we
develop a multi-path ray tracing algorithm that leverages the ground plane
constraint and identifies the most probable reflection path based on signal
path loss and spatial distance. We also introduce a curve-to-plane segmentation
method to simplify tunnel surface modeling such that we can significantly
reduce the computational delay and achieve real-time processing.
  We have evaluated mmTunnel with comprehensive experiments. In two test
tunnels, we conducted controlled experiments in various scenarios with cars and
trucks. Our system achieves an average F1 score of 93.7% for vehicle detection
while maintaining real-time processing. Even in the challenging occlusion
scenarios, the F1 score remains above 91%. Moreover, we collected extensive
data from a public tunnel with heavy traffic at times and show our method could
achieve an F1 score of 91.5% in real-world traffic conditions.

Abstract: The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Large Language
Models (LLMs), and Large Telecom Models (LTM) significantly reshapes mobile
networks, especially as the telecom industry transitions from 5G's
cloud-centric to AI-native 6G architectures. This transition unlocks
unprecedented capabilities in real-time automation, semantic networking, and
autonomous service orchestration. However, it introduces critical risks related
to data sovereignty, security, explainability, and regulatory compliance
especially when AI models are trained, deployed, or governed externally. This
paper introduces the concept of `Sovereign AI' as a strategic imperative for
6G, proposing architectural, operational, and governance frameworks that enable
national or operator-level control over AI development, deployment, and
life-cycle management. Focusing on O-RAN architecture, we explore how sovereign
AI-based xApps and rApps can be deployed Near-RT and Non-RT RICs to ensure
policy-aligned control, secure model updates, and federated learning across
trusted infrastructure. We analyse global strategies, technical enablers, and
challenges across safety, talent, and model governance. Our findings underscore
that Sovereign AI is not just a regulatory necessity but a foundational pillar
for secure, resilient, and ethically-aligned 6G networks.

Method: 采用图神经网络（GNN）增强的深度强化学习框架（VariSAC），引入连续连接比（CCR）作为统一指标，并通过Soft Actor-Critic（SAC）代理联合优化信道分配、功率控制和RIS配置。

Result: 在真实城市数据集上的实验表明，VariSAC在持续V2I ISAC连接和V2V交付可靠性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: VariSAC框架通过结合GNN和深度强化学习，在RIS辅助的ISAC-enabled V2X系统中实现了持续的连接可靠性，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: The integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and Integrated
Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in vehicular networks enables dynamic spatial
resource management and real-time adaptation to environmental changes. However,
the coexistence of distinct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity requirements, together with highly
dynamic and heterogeneous network topologies, presents significant challenges
for unified reliability modeling and resource optimization. To address these
issues, we propose VariSAC, a graph neural network (GNN)-augmented deep
reinforcement learning framework for assured, time-continuous connectivity in
RIS-assisted, ISAC-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. Specifically,
we introduce the Continuous Connectivity Ratio (CCR), a unified metric that
characterizes the sustained temporal reliability of V2I connections and the
probabilistic delivery guarantees of V2V links, thus unifying their continuous
reliability semantics. Next, we employ a GNN with residual adapters to encode
complex, high-dimensional system states, capturing spatial dependencies among
vehicles, base stations (BS), and RIS nodes. These representations are then
processed by a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent, which jointly optimizes channel
allocation, power control, and RIS configurations to maximize CCR-driven
long-term rewards. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets
demonstrate that VariSAC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms
of continuous V2I ISAC connectivity and V2V delivery reliability, enabling
persistent connectivity in highly dynamic vehicular environments.

environments make satellites vulnerable to failures, leading to node removals
that disrupt inter-satellite networking. With the high risk of satellite node
failures, understanding their impact on end-to-end services is essential. This
study investigates the importance of individual nodes on inter-satellite
networking and the resilience of mega satellite constellations against node
failures. We represent the mega-satellite constellation as discrete temporal
graphs and model node failure events accordingly. To quantify node importance
for targeted services over time, we propose a service-aware temporal
betweenness metric. Leveraging this metric, we develop an analytical framework
to identify critical nodes and assess the impact of node failures. The
framework takes node failure events as input and efficiently evaluates their
impacts across current and subsequent time windows. Simulations on the Starlink
constellation setting reveal that satellite networks inherently exhibit
resilience to node failures, as their dynamic topology partially restore
connectivity and mitigate the long-term impact. Furthermore, we find that the
integration of rerouting mechanisms is crucial for unleashing the full
resilience potential to ensure rapid recovery of inter-satellite networking.

### [187] [BatStation: Toward In-Situ Radar Sensing on 5G Base Stations with Zero-Shot Template Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06898)
*Zhihui Gao,Zhecun Liu,Tingjun Chen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: BatStation 是一个集成到5G基站的轻量级雷达感知框架，通过合成数据训练的模型实现高效雷达信号处理，满足实时需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G信号与现有雷达信号的共存需要高效且自适应的频谱共享，利用密集部署的5G基站进行雷达感知具有广阔覆盖和即时反馈的优势，但实际部署需要轻量级、便携的雷达感知模型。

Method: BatStation 利用上行资源网格提取雷达信号，包括三个关键组件：(i) 雷达信号分离以消除并发的5G传输，(ii) 资源网格重塑以对齐时间-频率分辨率与雷达脉冲特性，(iii) 基于合成数据训练的零样本模板相关性支持雷达脉冲的检测、分类和定位。

Result: BatStation 在CBRS频段的真实5G流量中表现出色，检测概率达97.02%（PUCCH）和79.23%（PUSCH），分类准确率高达97.00%，频率和时间的中位定位误差分别为2.68-6.20 MHz和24.6-32.4微秒。

Conclusion: BatStation 是一个轻量级、即时的雷达感知框架，成功集成到5G基站中，通过合成数据训练的便携模型实现了雷达信号的检测、分类和定位，无需实验数据微调，且在GPU/CPU上运行时延仅为0.11/0.94 ms，满足5G网络的实时需求。

Abstract: The coexistence between incumbent radar signals and commercial 5G signals
necessitates a versatile and ubiquitous radar sensing for efficient and
adaptive spectrum sharing. In this context, leveraging the densely deployed 5G
base stations (BS) for radar sensing is particularly promising, offering both
wide coverage and immediate feedback to 5G scheduling. However, the targeting
radar signals are superimposed with concurrent 5G uplink transmissions received
by the BS, and practical deployment also demands a lightweight, portable radar
sensing model. This paper presents BatStation, a lightweight, in-situ radar
sensing framework seamlessly integrated into 5G BSs. BatStation leverages
uplink resource grids to extract radar signals through three key components:
(i) radar signal separation to cancel concurrent 5G transmissions and reveal
the radar signals, (ii) resource grid reshaping to align time-frequency
resolution with radar pulse characteristics, and (iii) zero-shot template
correlation based on a portable model trained purely on synthetic data that
supports detection, classification, and localization of radar pulses without
fine-tuning using experimental data. We implement BatStation on a
software-defined radio (SDR) testbed and evaluate its performance with real 5G
traffic in the CBRS band. Results show robust performance across diverse radar
types, achieving detection probabilities of 97.02% (PUCCH) and 79.23% (PUSCH),
classification accuracy up to 97.00%, and median localization errors of
2.68-6.20 MHz (frequency) and 24.6-32.4 microseconds (time). Notably,
BatStation achieves this performance with a runtime latency of only 0.11/0.94
ms on GPU/CPU, meeting the real-time requirement of 5G networks.

### [188] [Adversarial Bug Reports as a Security Risk in Language Model-Based Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05372)
*Piotr Przymus,Andreas Happe,Jürgen Cito*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现对抗性漏洞报告能有效误导APR系统生成不安全补丁，当前防御措施效果有限，需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对抗性漏洞报告对基于LLM的自动程序修复（APR）系统带来的安全风险，揭示当前防御措施的不足。

Method: 开发了一个全面的威胁模型，并进行了实证研究，评估了最先进的APR系统对此类攻击的脆弱性。测试了51个对抗性漏洞报告，涵盖了从手动策划到完全自动化管道的策略。

Result: 90%的精心设计的漏洞报告触发了攻击者期望的补丁。最佳预修复过滤器仅阻止了47%，而后修复分析在仅58%的情况下有效。

Conclusion: 当前防御措施不足以应对对抗性漏洞报告的攻击，文章提出了提高APR系统鲁棒性的实用建议，并指出了未来可信自动修复的研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) - based Automated Program Repair (APR) systems are
increasingly integrated into modern software development workflows, offering
automated patches in response to natural language bug reports. However, this
reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack
surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial
bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR
systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a
comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the
vulnerability of state-of-the-art APR systems to such attacks. Our
demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum
of strategies, from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these
against leading APR model and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard
variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and
post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current
defenses are insufficient: 90\% of crafted bug reports triggered
attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47\%, while
post-repair analysis-often requiring human oversight-was effective in just 58\%
of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype
framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our
analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is
inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone.
We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the robustness of APR
systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on
trustworthy automated repair.

Method: 创建大型数据集用于训练机器学习模型，评估现有图像质量评估算法，并引入新的多尺度指标。

Result: 训练出一个大型开放权重模型，显著提高了转换的保真度。

Conclusion: 使用向量图像作为输入并结合多尺度质量评估指标，显著提高了UI设计到代码转换的保真度。尽管模型存在局限性，但为未来研究提供了有价值的开放权重模型。

Abstract: Automating the conversion of user interface design into code (image-to-code
or image-to-UI) is an active area of software engineering research. However,
the state-of-the-art solutions do not achieve high fidelity to the original

differently: I use vector images instead of bitmaps as model input. I create
several large datasets for training machine learning models. I evaluate the
available array of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) algorithms and introduce a
new, multi-scale metric. I then train a large open-weights model and discuss
its limitations.

### [190] [Combining TSL and LLM to Automate REST API Testing: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05540)
*Thiago Barradas,Aline Paes,Vânia de Oliveira Neves*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RestTSLLM 结合 TSL 和 LLMs 自动生成 REST API 测试用例，Claude 3.5 Sonnet 表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 REST API 测试执行中的复杂性和时间限制问题，提高测试覆盖率和减少未检测到的故障。

Method: 结合测试规范语言（TSL）和大型语言模型（LLMs），通过提示工程技术与自动化流程评估不同 LLMs 的能力。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Deepseek R1、Qwen 2.5 32b 和 Sabia 3 能生成稳健且上下文连贯的测试用例，其中 Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在所有指标中表现最优。

Conclusion: Claude 3.5 Sonnet 在生成 REST API 测试用例方面表现最佳，凸显了 LLMs 在基于 API 规范自动化测试生成中的潜力。

Abstract: The effective execution of tests for REST APIs remains a considerable
challenge for development teams, driven by the inherent complexity of
distributed systems, the multitude of possible scenarios, and the limited time
available for test design. Exhaustive testing of all input combinations is
impractical, often resulting in undetected failures, high manual effort, and
limited test coverage. To address these issues, we introduce RestTSLLM, an
approach that uses Test Specification Language (TSL) in conjunction with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases for REST APIs.
The approach targets two core challenges: the creation of test scenarios and
the definition of appropriate input data. The proposed solution integrates
prompt engineering techniques with an automated pipeline to evaluate various
LLMs on their ability to generate tests from OpenAPI specifications. The
evaluation focused on metrics such as success rate, test coverage, and mutation
score, enabling a systematic comparison of model performance. The results
indicate that the best-performing LLMs - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic),
Deepseek R1 (Deepseek), Qwen 2.5 32b (Alibaba), and Sabia 3 (Maritaca) -
consistently produced robust and contextually coherent REST API tests. Among
them, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed all other models across every metric,
emerging in this study as the most suitable model for this task. These findings
highlight the potential of LLMs to automate the generation of tests based on
API specifications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多策略集成方法，显著提升了需求-代码TLR任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在NL-PL场景中，仅依赖文本相似性存在语义鸿沟的局限性，因此需要探索更有效的TLR方法。

Method: 提出了一种结合多种领域特定辅助策略的方法，包括通过边类型增强的Heterogeneous Graph Transformer（HGT）和通过额外输入信息增强的prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，多策略集成的HGT和Gemini 2.5 Pro模型在12个开源项目中的平均F1分数分别比HGNNLink提高了3.68%和8.84%。

Conclusion: 通过实证分析，本文提出的多策略集成方法显著提升了HGT和Gemini 2.5 Pro模型在需求-代码TLR任务中的性能，验证了多策略集成在NL-PL场景中的有效性。

Abstract: In the field of software traceability link recovery (TLR), textual similarity
has long been regarded as the core criterion. However, in tasks involving
natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on
textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted
a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing
the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific
auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models:
the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based
Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach
using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case
of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and
Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy
integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method
HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average
F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve
open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy
integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code
TLR task.

Motivation: 验证PLC软件升级后现有功能的正确性是一个重大挑战，需要一种有效的验证方法。

Method: 将新旧版本的顺序功能图（SFC）转换为两个Petri网模型，并基于符号路径等价的新颖包含检查算法验证一个模型是否包含在另一个模型中。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在80个真实世界的OSCAT库基准测试中表现出良好的可扩展性和有效性，性能比verifAPS提升了近4倍。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于Petri网的验证方法，用于确保PLC软件升级后的功能正确性，并通过实验验证了其方法的可扩展性和有效性，相比现有工具verifAPS有近4倍的性能提升。

Abstract: Upgradation of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software is quite common
to accommodate evolving industrial requirements. Verifying the correctness of
such upgrades remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a
verification-based approach to ensure the correctness of the existing
functionality in the upgraded version of a PLC software. The method converts
the older and the newer versions of the sequential function chart (SFC) into
two Petri net models. We then verify whether one model is contained within
another, based on a novel containment checking algorithm grounded in symbolic
path equivalence. For this purpose, we have developed a home-grown Petri
net-based containment checker. Experimental evaluation on 80 real-world
benchmarks from the OSCAT library highlights the scalability and effectiveness
of the framework. We have compared our approach with verifAPS, a popular tool
used for software upgradation, and observed nearly 4x performance improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业传感器数据缺乏结构化和语义化的问题，支持在标准事件日志不可用的环境中进行流程挖掘。

Method: 采用四阶段流程：数据预处理、无监督聚类、基于大型语言模型（LLM）的标签生成和事件日志构建。关键创新是利用LLM生成有意义的标签。

Result: 评估结果表明，更丰富的提示能生成更准确和一致的标签，并引入新指标Similarity-Weighted Accuracy来评估标签质量。

Conclusion: IoT Miner 提供了一种可扩展且可解释的方法，通过结合AI和领域感知数据处理，从IoT数据生成事件日志，支持在传统日志缺失的环境中进行流程挖掘。

Abstract: This paper presents IoT Miner, a novel framework for automatically creating
high-level event logs from raw industrial sensor data to support process
mining. In many real-world settings, such as mining or manufacturing, standard
event logs are unavailable, and sensor data lacks the structure and semantics
needed for analysis. IoT Miner addresses this gap using a four-stage pipeline:
data preprocessing, unsupervised clustering, large language model (LLM)-based
labeling, and event log construction. A key innovation is the use of LLMs to
generate meaningful activity labels from cluster statistics, guided by
domain-specific prompts. We evaluate the approach on sensor data from a
Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) mining machine and introduce a new metric,
Similarity-Weighted Accuracy, to assess labeling quality. Results show that
richer prompts lead to more accurate and consistent labels. By combining AI
with domain-aware data processing, IoT Miner offers a scalable and
interpretable method for generating event logs from IoT data, enabling process
mining in settings where traditional logs are missing.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在明确定义的地理处理任务上的实际能力，避免过早宣称实现GIS全自动化。

Method: 通过GeoAnalystBench（包含50个基于Python的任务）评估专有和开源模型，涵盖工作流有效性、结构对齐、语义相似性和代码质量（CodeBLEU）。

Result: 专有模型（如ChatGPT-4o-mini）表现优异（95%有效性，CodeBLEU 0.39），而开源模型（如DeepSeek-R1-7B）表现较差（48.5%有效性，CodeBLEU 0.272）。需要深层空间推理的任务对所有模型最具挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在地理空间分析自动化中的潜力与局限，并提出了一个可复现的框架以推动GeoAI研究的进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled growing interest
in automating geospatial analysis and GIS workflows, yet their actual
capabilities remain uncertain. In this work, we call for rigorous evaluation of
LLMs on well-defined geoprocessing tasks before making claims about full GIS
automation. To this end, we present GeoAnalystBench, a benchmark of 50
Python-based tasks derived from real-world geospatial problems and carefully
validated by GIS experts. Each task is paired with a minimum deliverable
product, and evaluation covers workflow validity, structural alignment,
semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Using this benchmark, we
assess both proprietary and open source models. Results reveal a clear gap:
proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o-mini achieve high validity 95% and
stronger code alignment (CodeBLEU 0.39), while smaller open source models like
DeepSeek-R1-7B often generate incomplete or inconsistent workflows (48.5%
validity, 0.272 CodeBLEU). Tasks requiring deeper spatial reasoning, such as
spatial relationship detection or optimal site selection, remain the most
challenging across all models. These findings demonstrate both the promise and
limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation and provide a reproducible
framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support.

Motivation: 解决LLM与工具集成中的$N \times M$问题，减少手动转换现有软件为MCP服务的开发开销，加速MCP生态的发展。

Method: 采用多阶段工作流，包括代码分析、环境配置、服务生成和部署，并引入LLM驱动的‘Run--Review--Fix’闭环循环来自主调试和修复生成的代码。

Result: Code2MCP能够将任何GitHub仓库高效转化为功能性的MCP服务，并生成全面的技术文档，显著提升了集成效率。

Conclusion: Code2MCP成功解决了LLM与工具集成中的$N \times M$问题，通过高度自动化的框架将GitHub仓库转化为MCP服务，显著降低了开发开销并促进了MCP生态的扩展。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant
integration challenge in the AI agent ecosystem, often called the "$N \times M$
problem," where N models require custom integrations for M tools. This
fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead.
While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve
this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the
vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is
especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the
world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP,
a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub
repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our
system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from
code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and
deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop
"Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and
repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services
but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to
accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest
open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool
integration. The code is open-sourced at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检索增强生成方法在代码库级任务中过度依赖文本相似性、忽略结构关系以及丢失关键结构信息的问题。

Method: GRACE构建了统一文件结构、抽象语法树、函数调用图、类层次结构和数据流图的多级代码图，采用混合图检索器结合图神经网络和文本检索，并通过图注意力网络重新排序子图。

Result: 在公共代码库级基准测试中，GRACE在所有指标上均显著优于现有方法，使用DeepSeek-V3作为基础LLM时，性能提升8.19% EM和7.51% ES。

Conclusion: GRACE通过构建多级、多语义的代码图，结合图神经网络和文本检索的混合检索方法，显著提升了代码库级任务的性能，优于现有最佳方法。

Abstract: LLMs excel in localized code completion but struggle with repository-level
tasks due to limited context windows and complex semantic and structural
dependencies across codebases. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
mitigates context scarcity by retrieving relevant code snippets, current
approaches face significant limitations. They overly rely on textual similarity
for retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and
inheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively
concatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address
these shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph
that unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs,
class hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code
semantics. For retrieval, GRACE employs a Hybrid Graph Retriever that
integrates graph neural network-based structural similarity with textual
retrieval, refined by a graph attention network-based re-ranker to prioritize
topologically relevant subgraphs. To enhance context, GRACE introduces a
structural fusion mechanism that merges retrieved subgraphs with the local code
context and preserves essential dependencies like function calls and
inheritance. Extensive experiments on public repository-level benchmarks
demonstrate that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across all metrics. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the backbone LLM, GRACE surpasses the
strongest graph-based RAG baselines by 8.19% EM and 7.51% ES points on every
dataset. The code is available at

Method: 通过收集两所大学179名学生在两种教学形式（个人作业与团队敏捷项目）中使用LLMs的问卷调查数据，评估LLMs对学生学习体验的影响。

Result: LLMs提高了学生对RE概念的理解，尤其在需求获取和文档任务中。然而，学生也提出了对学术诚信、过度依赖AI及整合AI生成内容的担忧。个人作业学生比团队作业学生感知到更多益处。

Conclusion: 本研究为RE教育中有效整合LLMs提供了建议，并提出了未来研究方向，以平衡AI辅助学习与批判性思维及协作实践。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Requirements Engineering
(RE) education is reshaping pedagogical approaches, seeking to enhance student
engagement and motivation while providing practical tools to support their
professional future. This study empirically evaluates the impact of integrating
LLMs in RE coursework. We examined how the guided use of LLMs influenced
students' learning experiences, and what benefits and challenges they perceived
in using LLMs in RE practices. The study collected survey data from 179
students across two RE courses in two universities. LLMs were integrated into
coursework through different instructional formats, i.e., individual
assignments versus a team-based Agile project. Our findings indicate that LLMs
improved students' comprehension of RE concepts, particularly in tasks like
requirements elicitation and documentation. However, students raised concerns
about LLMs in education, including academic integrity, overreliance on AI, and
challenges in integrating AI-generated content into assignments. Students who
worked on individual assignments perceived that they benefited more than those
who worked on team-based assignments, highlighting the importance of contextual
AI integration. This study offers recommendations for the effective integration
of LLMs in RE education. It proposes future research directions for balancing
AI-assisted learning with critical thinking and collaborative practices in RE
courses.

Method: 论文采用快速回顾的方法，分析了现有文献中关于法律要求（LRs）的概念、定义和操作化。

Result: 回顾结果表明，对法律要求（LRs）的规范性理解普遍存在，但缺乏正确定义和概念操作化。文献中法律要求常被视为模糊、复杂且变化频繁，实施时往往仅提供最低基线。

Conclusion: 该论文通过对法律要求（LRs）在需求工程（RE）研究中的概念进行快速回顾，揭示了现有文献中的知识空白和概念混淆，并提出了对这些问题的批判性讨论。

Abstract: Out of a personal puzzlement, recent peer review comments, and demonstrable
confusion in the existing literature, the paper presents a rapid review of the
concept of legal requirements (LRs) in requirements engineering (RE) research.
According to reviewing results, a normative understanding of LRs has often been
present, although proper definitions and conceptual operationalizations are
lacking. Some papers also see LRs as functional and others as non-functional
requirements. Legal requirements are often characterized as being vague and
complex, requiring a lot of effort to elicit, implement, and validate. These
characterizations supposedly correlate with knowledge gaps among requirements
engineers. LRs are also seen to often change and overlap. They may be also
prioritized. According to the literature, they seem to be also reluctantly
implemented, often providing only a minimal baseline for other requirements.
With these and other observations, the review raises critical arguments about
apparent knowledge gaps, including a lack of empirical evidence backing the
observations and enduring conceptual confusion.

Method: 构建了一个包含19,448个样本的大规模二进制补丁数据集，并系统评估了19种不同规模的代码LLMs，探索了两种表示级别（汇编代码和伪代码），并研究了微调策略以注入二进制SPD领域知识。

Result: 直接提示普通代码LLMs难以准确识别二进制补丁中的安全补丁，而微调后的LLMs在伪代码表示上表现优异。

Conclusion: 微调后的LLMs在伪代码表示上取得了最佳性能，展示了其在二进制安全补丁检测任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security,
as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent
years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising
results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied
to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a
significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with
binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive
performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and
binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their
potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a
significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code
understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this
gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448}
samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and
systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate
their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that
directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security
patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques
fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla
models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning
strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two
levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs
achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the
pseudo-code representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型的广泛使用引入了新型软件依赖（Software Dependencies 2.0），但其在项目中的集成方式尚不清晰，可能影响软件系统的可靠性和可维护性。

Method: 采用混合方法分析，从PeaTMOSS数据集中随机抽取401个GitHub仓库，定量识别PTM重用模式，并定性研究开发者如何实际集成和管理这些模型。

Result: 研究发现开源项目中PTM依赖的结构、文档化方式、重用管道的组织模式及其与其他学习组件的交互情况。

Conclusion: 预训练模型（PTMs）作为软件依赖项在现代开源软件项目中的集成和管理方式尚不明确，可能威胁系统的可维护性和可靠性。本研究通过定量和定性分析揭示了PTM重用的结构、文档化方式、组织模式及其与其他学习组件的交互。

Abstract: Pre-trained models (PTMs) are machine learning models that have been trained
in advance, often on large-scale data, and can be reused for new tasks, thereby
reducing the need for costly training from scratch. Their widespread adoption
introduces a new class of software dependency, which we term Software
Dependencies 2.0, extending beyond conventional libraries to learned behaviors
embodied in trained models and their associated artifacts. The integration of
PTMs as software dependencies in real projects remains unclear, potentially
threatening maintainability and reliability of modern software systems that
increasingly rely on them. Objective: In this study, we investigate Software
Dependencies 2.0 in open-source software (OSS) projects by examining the reuse
of PTMs, with a focus on how developers manage and integrate these models.
Specifically, we seek to understand: (1) how OSS projects structure and
document their PTM dependencies; (2) what stages and organizational patterns
emerge in the reuse pipelines of PTMs within these projects; and (3) the
interactions among PTMs and other learned components across pipeline stages. We
conduct a mixed-methods analysis of a statistically significant random sample
of 401 GitHub repositories from the PeaTMOSS dataset (28,575 repositories
reusing PTMs from Hugging Face and PyTorch Hub). We quantitatively examine PTM
reuse by identifying patterns and qualitatively investigate how developers
integrate and manage these models in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Agentic软件工程（SE 3.0）的新时代，强调人类与智能代理的双向合作，并提出了两个工作台（ACE和AEE）以支持这一愿景，旨在推动SE社区迈向结构化、可扩展且可信赖的Agentic未来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Agentic SE时代，需要重新构想软件工程的基础支柱，以应对智能代理在实现复杂、目标导向的SE目标时的新挑战。

Method: 论文提出了两个专门构建的工作台：Agent Command Environment (ACE)和Agent Execution Environment (AEE)，以支持人类与智能代理之间的双向合作关系。

Result: 论文提出了Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE)愿景，并概述了未来SE的几个基础支柱。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个概念性框架，旨在激发社区对Agentic软件工程（SE 3.0）的广泛讨论，推动SE社区超越传统的人类中心原则，迈向一个结构化、可扩展且可信赖的Agentic未来。

Abstract: Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent
agents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex,
goal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring
trustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in
the Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE
for Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational
pillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest
differently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to
support this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command
center where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such
as Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The
Agent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform
tasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex
trade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated
human callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering
activities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating
the practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This
paper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision,
outlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper
culminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and
opportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on
SE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a
conceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide
dialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric
tenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了软件工程师如何从失败中学习，发现当前实践多为非正式且缺乏系统性，提出了改进失败管理的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件失败可能带来严重后果，因此从失败中学习是软件工程的关键部分。然而，目前缺乏关于从失败中学习的实践和挑战的深入行业视角。

Method: 研究方法包括对一个国家空间研究中心的10名研究软件工程师进行深入访谈，并补充了来自其他高可靠性组织的5次访谈数据，以评估可转移性。

Result: 研究发现：(1)失败学习是非正式、临时性的，且未系统集成到软件开发生命周期中；(2)由于缺乏结构化流程，重复性失败持续存在；(3)时间限制、人员流动导致的知识流失、文档碎片化和流程执行不力等挑战阻碍了系统性学习。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，软件工程师从失败中学习的实践目前是非正式且不系统的，缺乏结构化流程导致了重复性失败。研究为改进失败管理实践提供了指导。

Abstract: Software failures can have significant consequences, making learning from
failures a critical aspect of software engineering. While software
organizations are recommended to conduct postmortems, the effectiveness and
adoption of these practices vary widely. Understanding how engineers gather,
document, share, and apply lessons from failures is essential for improving
reliability and preventing recurrence. High-reliability organizations (HROs)
often develop software systems where failures carry catastrophic risks,
requiring continuous learning to ensure reliability. These organizations
provide a valuable setting to examine practices and challenges for learning
from software failures. Such insight could help develop processes and tools to
improve reliability and prevent recurrence. However, we lack in-depth industry
perspectives on the practices and challenges of learning from failures.
  To address this gap, we conducted a case study through 10 in-depth interviews
with research software engineers at a national space research center. We
examine how they learn from failures: how they gather, document, share, and
apply lessons. To assess transferability, we include data from 5 additional
interviews at other HROs. Our findings provide insight into how engineers learn
from failures in practice. To summarize: (1) failure learning is informal, ad
hoc, and inconsistently integrated into SDLC; (2) recurring failures persist
due to absence of structured processes; and (3) key challenges, including time
constraints, knowledge loss from turnover and fragmented documentation, and
weak process enforcement, undermine systematic learning. Our findings deepen
understanding of how software engineers learn from failures and offer guidance
for improving failure management practices.

TL;DR: PyMOP是一个高效、通用的Python运行时验证系统，支持多种逻辑和监控算法，显著提升了性能并帮助发现和修复了大量错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python生态系统需要一种通用、可扩展且高效的运行时验证（RV）系统，以弥补当前Python RV系统的局限性（如领域或规范逻辑受限、速度慢）。

Method: PyMOP支持五种逻辑，实现了五种现有的监控算法，配备了73个Python及常用库的API规范，支持三种插桩策略，并且用户可以轻松扩展。

Result: 在1,463个GitHub项目的290,133个单元测试中，PyMOP表现优异：(i) Java的默认监控算法通常不是Python中最快的；(ii) PyMOP比两种最近的动态分析系统快达1,168.3倍；(iii) PyMOP帮助发现的121个错误中有44个已被开发者修复。

Conclusion: PyMOP的通用性和高效性使其成为Python运行时验证（RV）领域的优秀平台，为未来的进步奠定了基础。

Abstract: Runtime verification (RV) now scales for testing thousands of open-source
Java projects, helping find hundreds of bugs. The popular Python ecosystem
could use such benefits. But, today's Python RV systems are limited to a domain
or specification logic, or slow. We propose PyMOP, a generic, extensible, and
efficient RV system for Python. PyMOP supports five logics, implements five
existing monitoring algorithms, ships with 73 API specs of Python and
widely-used libraries, supports three instrumentation strategies, and users can
easily add more of these. On 290,133 unit tests in 1,463 GitHub projects, we
find mainly that (i) the default monitoring algorithm for Java is often not the
fastest for Python; (ii) PyMOP is up to 1,168.3x faster than two recent dynamic
analysis systems; and (iii) 44 of 121 bugs that PyMOP helped find so far were
fixed by developers. PyMOP's generality and efficiency position it well as an
excellent platform for the next advances on RV for Python.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在软件工程任务（如代码生成和错误修复）中的应用日益增长，但其输出在不同时间执行相同输入时的不稳定性尚未被充分评估。本研究旨在探究ChatGPT在代码错误修复任务中的不稳定性。

Method: 通过在不同温度设置（0、0.5和1）下生成多个修复建议，并使用语法相似性和输出等价率（OER）指标评估输出的结构和功能一致性。实验分析了20个问题的九种不同输出。

Result: 结果显示，随着温度升高，模型的输出变得更加不稳定和多样化，高温度下尤其表现出高功能失败率。语法相似性分析表明，高温度下的修复建议结构差异显著，而低温度下则较为相似。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了在软件工程任务中使用LLMs（如ChatGPT）进行代码错误修复时的不稳定性问题，特别是在高温度设置下，模型的输出表现出更高的功能失败率和结构差异。研究为基于LLM的错误修复系统在软件开发过程中的更一致应用提供了重要方法学见解。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering tasks is
growing, especially in the areas of bug fixing and code generation.
Nevertheless, these models often yield unstable results; when executed at
different times with the same input, they can generate radically different
code. The consistency of LLMs in bug-fixing tasks has not yet been thoroughly
assessed, despite the fact that this instability has typically been discussed
in the literature in relation to code generation. The purpose of this study is
to look into how unstable an LLM like ChatGPT is when it comes to fixing code
bugs. We examine the structural, syntactic, and functional variations among
several fix recommendations made in response to the same prompt using code
samples with various error types. Additionally, we assess how instability is
affected by the temperature settings (0, 0.5, and 1) used for the model's
deterministic operation. For a total of 20 problems in the experimental
analysis, the model produced three fix suggestions at each temperature value,
comparing nine distinct outputs for each problem. The Syntax Similarity and
Output Equivalence Rate (OER) metrics were used to assess the outputs'
structural and functional consistency. The results demonstrate that the model's
outputs become much more unstable and variable as the temperature rises, with
high temperatures showing especially high rates of functional failure.
According to syntax similarity analyses, the suggested fixes show notable
structural differences at high temperatures but are fairly similar at low
temperatures. The purpose of this study is to provide important methodological
insights into how LLM-based error correction systems can be applied more
consistently in software development processes while also casting doubt on
their dependability.

Motivation: 现实设计过程中常涉及多路径演化，现有建模空间无法直接管理这种时空变异性，需依赖外部工具。

Method: 引入Design Multiverse概念，通过模型联邦范式实现设计状态快照的集成与管理。

Result: 支持设计决策追踪、系统变体分析及互依赖性管理，适用于模型产品线和模型/元模型协同演化场景。

Conclusion: Design Multiverse为复杂系统设计提供了一种内建模空间的管理方案，提升了多团队协作效率。

Abstract: Real-world design processes often involve the evolution and divergence of
design paths (by branching, revising, merging, etc.), especially when multiple
stakeholders or teams operate concurrently and/or explore different
alternatives for complex and heterogeneous systems. Unfortunately, this
variability in time and space can not be directly managed in current modeling
spaces but requires resorting to external tools and methodologies.
  In order to tackle this problem, we introduce the Design Multiverse. The
Design Multiverse aims to integrate in the modeling space a selection of
revisions and variants, representing snapshots of a design state composed of
multiple artifacts. This enables stakeholders to seamlessly trace, analyze, and
manage design decisions, system variants, and their interdependencies.
Concretely, in this paper we present a conceptual definition of the Design
Multiverse, discuss usage scenarios such as model product lines and
model/metamodel co-evolution, and propose an implementation leveraging the
model federation paradigm.

paper, a DSL namely, Bmod is introduced, which can be used to model evacuation
scenarios. The language is built using Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF) and
Eclipse Graphical Modelling Framework (GMF). Furthermore, a comparison is also
shown between Eclipse EMF/GMF and other modelling tools such as AToMPM,
metaDepth, Sirius etc with respect to expressiveness, learning curve and
performance.

Motivation: 基准测试在软件工程中用于评估软件变体的质量和性能，但执行完整基准测试的计算资源和时间成本极高。

Method: BISS（BISection Sampling）采用分治策略，战略性保留关键测试并高效采样剩余相关测试。

Result: 在LLM排行榜、SAT竞赛和可配置系统的性能建模数据集上，BISS方法优于基线，计算成本平均降至44%，部分基准测试成本降低高达99%。

Conclusion: BISS方法通过战略性保留关键测试并应用分治方法，显著降低了基准测试的计算成本（平均降至44%），同时保持了排名的稳定性。

Abstract: Benchmarking is a common practice in software engineering to assess the
qualities and performance of software variants, coming from multiple competing
systems or from configurations of the same system. Benchmarks are used notably
to compare and understand variant performance, fine-tune software, detect
regressions, or design new software systems. The execution of benchmarks to get
a complete picture of software variants is highly costly in terms of
computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
for reducing benchmarks while maintaining stable rankings, using test suite
optimization techniques. That is, we remove instances from the benchmarks while
trying to keep the same rankings of the variants on all tests. Our method,
BISection Sampling, BISS, strategically retains the most critical tests and
applies a novel divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sample among
relevant remaining tests. We experiment with datasets and use cases from LLM
leaderboards, SAT competitions, and configurable systems for performance
modeling. Our results show that our method outperforms baselines even when
operating on a subset of variants. Using BISS, we reduce the computational cost
of the benchmarks on average to 44% and on more than half the benchmarks by up
to 99% without loss in ranking stability.

Abstract: Organizations and educational institutions use time-bound assessment tasks to
evaluate coding and problem-solving skills. These assessments measure not only
the correctness of the solutions, but also their efficiency. Problem setters
(educator/interviewer) are responsible for crafting these challenges, carefully
balancing difficulty and relevance to create meaningful evaluation experiences.
Conversely, problem solvers (student/interviewee) apply coding efficiency and
logical thinking to arrive at correct solutions. In the era of Large Language
Models (LLMs), LLMs assist problem setters in generating diverse and
challenging questions, but they can undermine assessment integrity for problem
solvers by providing easy access to solutions. This paper introduces
OpenCoderRank, an easy-to-use platform designed to simulate technical
assessments. It acts as a bridge between problem setters and problem solvers,
helping solvers prepare for time constraints and unfamiliar problems while
allowing setters to self-host assessments, offering a no-cost and customizable
solution for technical assessments in resource-constrained environments.

<details>

Motivation: 针对静态系统中事件数据的异常检测需求，HyGLAD旨在提供一种直接可解释的模型，以避免深度学习方法的黑箱问题。

Method: HyGLAD通过推断具有相似行为的实体等价类，并构建正则表达式来捕获这些实体的值，从而建模事件数据。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，HyGLAD平均表现优于所有7种无监督异常检测方法，训练和推理效率提升一个数量级（单CPU vs GPU），精确度和召回率分别提高1.2倍和1.3倍。

Conclusion: HyGLAD算法在保持高效性和可解释性的同时，显著优于现有的深度学习方法，尤其在精确度和召回率上表现优异。

Abstract: We propose HyGLAD, a novel algorithm that automatically builds a set of
interpretable patterns that model event data. These patterns can then be used
to detect event-based anomalies in a stationary system, where any deviation
from past behavior may indicate malicious activity. The algorithm infers
equivalence classes of entities with similar behavior observed from the events,
and then builds regular expressions that capture the values of those entities.
As opposed to deep-learning approaches, the regular expressions are directly
interpretable, which also translates to interpretable anomalies. We evaluate
HyGLAD against all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five
datasets from real-world systems. The experimental results show that on average
HyGLAD outperforms existing deep-learning methods while being an order of
magnitude more efficient in training and inference (single CPU vs GPU).
Precision improved by 1.2x and recall by 1.3x compared to the second-best
baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同云服务提供商使用不同的IaC格式，缺乏标准化增加了云部署的复杂性，而现有LLM在IaC生成和维护方面的研究缺乏跨格式的全面基准。

Method: 通过合成数据生成管道创建包含初始IaC模板、自然语言修改请求和更新后模板的三元组数据集，并对多个先进LLM进行评估。

Result: 现代LLM在生成语法有效的IaC方面成功率较高（>95%），但在语义对齐和处理复杂基础设施模式方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了Multi-IaC-Bench基准数据集，用于评估LLM在跨多种IaC格式中的生成和修改能力，并强调了提示工程和重试机制的重要性。

Abstract: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is fundamental to modern cloud computing,
enabling teams to define and manage infrastructure through machine-readable
configuration files. However, different cloud service providers utilize diverse
IaC formats. The lack of a standardized format requires cloud architects to be
proficient in multiple IaC languages, adding complexity to cloud deployment.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating IaC creation and
maintenance, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks
across multiple IaC formats. We present Multi-IaC-Bench, a novel benchmark
dataset for evaluating LLM-based IaC generation and mutation across AWS
CloudFormation, Terraform, and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) formats. The dataset
consists of triplets containing initial IaC templates, natural language
modification requests, and corresponding updated templates, created through a
synthetic data generation pipeline with rigorous validation. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IaC-Bench, demonstrating that while
modern LLMs can achieve high success rates (>95%) in generating syntactically
valid IaC across formats, significant challenges remain in semantic alignment
and handling complex infrastructure patterns. Our ablation studies highlight
the importance of prompt engineering and retry mechanisms in successful IaC
generation. We release Multi-IaC-Bench to facilitate further research in
AI-assisted infrastructure management and establish standardized evaluation
metrics for this crucial domain.

TL;DR: 本文证明Huang等人（2012）的分布式计数协议在适应性设置下不稳健，并提出了一种新的简单协议，首次在适应性设置下达到最优通信复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式计数问题在服务器需要持续近似多个站点事件总数时尤为重要。尽管已有研究在确定性协议和随机化协议上取得进展，但现有协议要么假设事件流与协议输出无关（非适应性假设），要么通信复杂度次优且复杂度高。本文旨在解决这些局限。

Method: 本文首先通过构造一个明确的适应性攻击，证明了Huang等人（2012）的协议在非适应性假设下不稳健。随后，提出了一种新的分布式计数协议，该协议在复杂度上更低，并在适应性设置下实现了最优通信复杂度。

Result: 本文证明了Huang等人（2012）的协议在适应性设置下不稳健，并提出了一种新的协议，该协议在适应性设置下实现了最优通信复杂度（O(√k/ε log N)），且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: 本文通过证明Huang等人（2012）的协议在非适应性假设下不稳健，并提出了一种新的简单且稳健的分布式计数协议，填补了现有研究的空白。新协议不仅复杂度更低，而且在适应性设置下首次达到了最优通信复杂度。

Abstract: We revisit the distributed counting problem, where a server must continuously
approximate the total number of events occurring across $k$ sites while
minimizing communication. The communication complexity of this problem is known
to be $\Theta(\frac{k}{\epsilon}\log N)$ for deterministic protocols. Huang,
Yi, and Zhang (2012) showed that randomization can reduce this to
$\Theta(\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\epsilon}\log N)$, but their analysis is restricted to
the {\em oblivious setting}, where the stream of events is independent of the
protocol's outputs.
  Xiong, Zhu, and Huang (2023) presented a robust protocol for distributed
counting that removes the oblivious assumption. However, their communication
complexity is suboptimal by a $polylog(k)$ factor and their protocol is
substantially more complex than the oblivious protocol of Huang et al. (2012).
This left open a natural question: could it be that the simple protocol of
Huang et al. (2012) is already robust?
  We resolve this question with two main contributions. First, we show that the
protocol of Huang et al. (2012) is itself not robust by constructing an
explicit adaptive attack that forces it to lose its accuracy. Second, we
present a new, surprisingly simple, robust protocol for distributed counting
that achieves the optimal communication complexity of
$O(\frac{\sqrt{k}}{\epsilon} \log N)$. Our protocol is simpler than that of
Xiong et al. (2023), perhaps even simpler than that of Huang et al. (2012), and
is the first to match the optimal oblivious complexity in the adaptive setting.

Motivation: 现有的分区和路由策略在扩展向量搜索系统中效率不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: DISTRIBUTEDANN 结合了分布式键值存储和内存中的近似最近邻（ANN）索引，实现了跨上千台机器的 500 亿向量图索引搜索。

Result: DISTRIBUTEDANN 实现了 26 毫秒的中位数查询延迟，每秒处理超过 10 万次查询，效率比现有方案高 6 倍。

Conclusion: DISTRIBUTEDANN 成功替代了传统的扩展架构，为 Bing 搜索引擎提供服务，并展示了其高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: We present DISTRIBUTEDANN, a distributed vector search service that makes it
possible to search over a single 50 billion vector graph index spread across
over a thousand machines that offers 26ms median query latency and processes
over 100,000 queries per second. This is 6x more efficient than existing
partitioning and routing strategies that route the vector query to a subset of
partitions in a scale out vector search system. DISTRIBUTEDANN is built using
two well-understood components: a distributed key-value store and an in-memory
ANN index. DISTRIBUTEDANN has replaced conventional scale-out architectures for
serving the Bing search engine, and we share our experience from making this
transition.

TL;DR: 论文解决了非顶点传递图上机器人聚集问题，提出了一种分布式算法，处理了多重性且无法检测的情况，并分析了时间复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在`敌对`环境下（即初始配置可能包含多重性且机器人无法检测多重性）的机器人聚集问题，特别是在非顶点传递图上的应用。

Method: 采用分布式算法，考虑机器人沿图的边移动，处理初始配置中的多重性（multiplicities）且无法检测多重性的情况。调度器采用轮询（round-robin）激活方式。

Result: 提出了一个适用于任何机器人配置的解决算法，并分析了其时间复杂性。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一个解决非顶点传递图上机器人聚集问题的算法，并证明了其正确性和时间复杂性。

Abstract: The Gathering problem for a swarm of robots asks for a distributed algorithm
that brings such entities to a common place, not known in advance. We consider
the well-known OBLOT model with robots constrained to move along the edges of a
graph, hence gathering in one vertex, eventually. Despite the classical setting
under which the problem has been usually approached, we consider the `hostile'
case where: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more
than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect
multiplicities. As a scheduler for robot activation, we consider the
"favorable" round-robin case, where robots are activated one at a time.
  Our objective is to achieve a complete characterization of the problem in the
broad context of non-vertex-transitive graphs, i.e., graphs where the vertices
are partitioned into at least two different classes of equivalence. We provide
a resolution algorithm for any configuration of robots moving on such graphs,
along with its correctness. Furthermore, we analyze its time complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工业建筑和家庭自动化行业未能全面解决硬件故障、供应商淘汰和不断演变的安全威胁，限制了大规模智能自动化部署的可行性。

Method: 利用容器化技术和管理资源访问，构建了一个基于经济实惠的现成IoT硬件的分布式控制平台。

Conclusion: KaOS通过分布式控制平台解决了智能建筑自动化系统中的硬件故障、供应商淘汰和安全威胁等问题，展示了其在实际应用中的可行性和长期维护潜力。

Abstract: Operating an intelligent smart building automation system in 2025 is met with
many challenges: hardware failures, vendor obsolescence, evolving security
threats and more. None of these have been comprehensibly addressed by the
industrial building nor home automation industries, limiting feasibility of
operating large, truly smart automation deployments. This paper introduces
KaOS, a distributed control platform for constructing robust and evolvable
smart building automation systems using affordable, off-the-shelf IoT hardware.
Supporting control applications and distributed system operations by leveraging
containerisation and managed resource access, KaOS seeks to achieve
flexibility, security, and fault tolerance without sacrificing
cost-effectiveness. Initial evaluation confirms the practical feasibility of
our approach, highlighting its potential to sustainably maintain and
incrementally evolve building control functionalities over extended timeframes.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FineServe是一个针对混合精度LLM的推理服务框架，通过动态内存管理和两级调度优化，显著提升了服务效率和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化模型虽然减少了内存占用，但因其KV块大小较小导致内存碎片化，且与非量化模型的资源使用模式不同，需要高效调度以最大化吞吐量。

Method: FineServe采用KV Slab技术动态分配KV缓存，并设计了两级调度框架（全局调度器和本地调度器）来优化模型放置和批处理大小调整。

Result: 实验表明，FineServe比现有GPU共享系统在SLO达成率和令牌生成吞吐量上分别提高了2.2倍和1.8倍。

Conclusion: FineServe通过其KV Slab内存管理技术和两级调度框架，显著提高了混合精度LLM的推理服务效率，实现了更高的SLO达成率和吞吐量。

Abstract: Recent advances in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have
significantly increased demand for serving quantized large language models
(LLMs), enabling higher throughput and substantially reduced memory usage with
minimal accuracy loss. Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and
enhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However,
quantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing
limited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource
usage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient
scheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose
FineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's
key contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory
management technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model
quantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation,
and (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that
places models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory
constraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch
sizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results
demonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x
higher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing
systems.

### [217] [MaaSO: SLO-aware Orchestration of Heterogeneous Model Instances for MaaS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06362)
*Mo Xuan,Zhang yue,Wu Weigang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MaaSO是首个MaaS编排器，通过异构实例配置和SLO感知请求分发，显著提升LLM推理性能，实验效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM推理系统通常采用相同配置的模型实例，无法利用异构性满足多样化的SLO需求。MaaSO旨在填补这一研究空白，通过动态配置和优化提升服务性能。

Method: MaaSO包含三个模块：性能分析器（profiler）、配置优化器（placer）和请求分发器（distributor）。性能分析器评估不同并行策略和推理批次大小下的实例性能；配置优化器优化异构实例配置；请求分发器实现SLO感知的请求分发并防止级联超时。

Result: 实验表明，MaaSO将SLO满足率提高了15%至30%，响应延迟降低了40%至60%，并显著降低了整体编排开销。

Conclusion: MaaSO作为一种新型的MaaS编排器，通过异构实例配置和SLO感知请求分发，显著提升了SLO满足率和响应延迟，同时降低了编排开销。

Abstract: Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms face diverse Service Level Objective
(SLO) requirements stemming from various large language model (LLM)
applications, manifested in contextual complexity, first-token latency, and
between-token latency. On the other hand, an LLM instance, when configured with
different parallelism strategies and inference batch sizes, exhibits distinct
performance characteristics and can thus be used to serve different SLO
requirements. However, current LLM inference systems typically deploy instances
of the same model with identical configurations, lacking mechanisms to leverage
such heterogeneity. To fill this research gap, we propose MaaSO, the first MaaS
Orchestrator, which comprises three modules: (1) a profiler characterizing
instance performance under diverse parallelism strategies and inference batch
sizes; (2) a placer optimizing heterogeneous instance configurations; (3) a
distributor enabling SLO-aware request distribution and preventing cascaded
timeouts in continuous batching. Experiments show that MaaSO improves the SLO
satisfaction ratio by 15 to 30% and reduces response latency by 40 to 60%
compared to existing approaches, and significantly lowers overall orchestration
overhead.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 首个基于PIM的多服务器PIR架构IM-PIR，通过高并行性和高内存带宽，将查询吞吐量提升3.7倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PIR构造计算成本高，且受限于传统处理器中心架构的内存带宽瓶颈。PIM作为一种新兴计算范式，有望解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了首个基于PIM的多服务器PIR架构，讨论了其算法基础，并展示了其操作如何与PIM架构的核心优势（高并行性和高内存带宽）对齐。在UPMEM PIM上设计并实现了IM-PIR。

Result: 基于PIM的多服务器PIR实现显著提升了查询吞吐量，比标准CPU方法快3.7倍。

Conclusion: IM-PIR，一种基于PIM的多服务器PIR实现，相比传统的基于CPU的PIR方法，查询吞吐量提高了3.7倍以上。

Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic primitive that allows
a client to securely query one or multiple servers without revealing their
specific interests. In spite of their strong security guarantees, current PIR
constructions are computationally costly. Specifically, most PIR
implementations are memory-bound due to the need to scan extensive databases
(in the order of GB), making them inherently constrained by the limited memory
bandwidth in traditional processor-centric computing
architectures.Processing-in-memory (PIM) is an emerging computing paradigm that
augments memory with compute capabilities, addressing the memory bandwidth
bottleneck while simultaneously providing extensive parallelism.Recent research
has demonstrated PIM's potential to significantly improve performance across a
range of data-intensive workloads, including graph processing, genome analysis,
and machine learning.
  In this work, we propose the first PIM-based architecture for multi-server
PIR. We discuss the algorithmic foundations of the latter and show how its
operations align with the core strengths of PIM architectures: extensive
parallelism and high memory bandwidth. Based on this observation, we design and
implement IM-PIR, a PIM-based multi-server PIR approach on top of UPMEM PIM,
the first openly commercialized PIM architecture. Our evaluation demonstrates
that a PIM-based multi-server PIR implementation significantly improves query
throughput by more than 3.7x when compared to a standard CPU-based PIR
approach.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Mangrove是一种支持并行智能合约的区块链扩展方法，通过独立共识实例和Parallel Optimistic Agreement机制，在乐观条件下实现低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单体区块链的单一共识机制限制了交易处理的并行性，Mangrove旨在通过并行化提升区块链的可扩展性和性能。

Method: Mangrove采用每个智能合约独立的共识实例，避免全局排序，并提出了Parallel Optimistic Agreement机制确保无冲突交易提交，同时利用Byzantine Reliable Broadcast减少简单交易的延迟。

Result: 在无恶意行为且网络同步的乐观条件下，Mangrove协议实现了交易创建与执行间仅需2次通信步骤的低延迟。

Conclusion: Mangrove提出了一种新颖的区块链扩展方法，通过并行智能合约支持，优化了性能，在乐观条件下实现了低延迟。

Abstract: Mangrove is a novel scaling approach to building blockchains with parallel
smart contract support. Unlike in monolithic blockchains, where a single
consensus mechanism determines a strict total order over all transactions,
Mangrove uses separate consensus instances per smart contract, without a global
order. To allow multiple instances to run in parallel while ensuring that no
conflicting transactions are committed, we propose a mechanism called Parallel
Optimistic Agreement. Additionally, for simple transactions, we leverage a
lightweight Byzantine Reliable Broadcast primitive to reduce latency. Mangrove
is optimized for performance under optimistic conditions, where there is no
misbehavior and the network is synchronous. Under these conditions, our
protocol can achieve a latency of 2 communication steps between creating and
executing a transaction.

Conclusion: 论文提出了Perception Graph模型，旨在通过量化感知扭曲分数来检测和分析认知攻击的影响，为AR系统在战术环境中的安全性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical
environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes
them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and
severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human
perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the
human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then
representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We
demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the
level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for
detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management, yet
progress in predictive tasks -- such as delivery delay prediction -- remains
constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, openly available datasets.
Existing datasets are often proprietary, small, or inconsistently maintained,
hindering reproducibility and benchmarking. We present SynDelay, a synthetic
dataset designed for delivery delay prediction. Generated using an advanced
generative model trained on real-world data, SynDelay preserves realistic
delivery patterns while ensuring privacy. Although not entirely free of noise
or inconsistencies, it provides a challenging and practical testbed for
advancing predictive modelling. To support adoption, we provide baseline
results and evaluation metrics as initial benchmarks, serving as reference
points rather than state-of-the-art claims. SynDelay is publicly available
through the Supply Chain Data Hub, an open initiative promoting dataset sharing
and benchmarking in supply chain AI. We encourage the community to contribute
datasets, models, and evaluation practices to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Automatic emotion recognition has become increasingly important with the rise
of AI, especially in fields like healthcare, education, and automotive systems.
However, there is a lack of multimodal datasets, particularly involving body
motion and physiological signals, which limits progress in the field. To
address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings
from 13 participants aged 12 to 60 exposed to VR based emotional stimuli
(relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Data were collected using eye
tracking (via webcam in a VR headset), body motion (Kinect v2), and EMG and GSR
signals (Arduino UNO), all timestamp aligned. Participants followed a unified
protocol with consent and questionnaires. Features from each modality were
extracted, fused using early and late fusion techniques, and evaluated with
classifiers to confirm the datasets quality and emotion separability, making
MVRS a valuable contribution to multimodal affective computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs被日益视为个性化学习的智能助手，但在真实学习场景中的系统性对比评估仍显不足。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过实证比较评估LLMs在辅导任务中的表现。

Method: 研究采用实证比较方法，在模拟真实学习场景的辅导任务中评估三种先进LLMs（GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3、GLM-4.5）。通过学生答题数据集，要求LLMs分析知识成分、推断学生掌握情况并生成针对性指导。使用Gemini作为虚拟评委进行多维度（准确性、清晰度、可操作性、适当性）的成对比较，并通过Bradley-Terry模型分析结果。

Result: GPT-4o在反馈的信息量和结构上普遍优于DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5，后两者虽在某些方面表现突出但一致性较低。Gemini的虚拟评委机制有效减少了评估主观性。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在提供个性化学习反馈方面表现最佳，DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5虽有间歇性优势但一致性较低。研究证实了LLMs作为高级教学助理的可行性，并为未来LLM驱动的个性化学习研究提供了方法论指导。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These
tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived
from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface
enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate
SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然提示工程已成为优化大型语言模型性能的关键技术，但其底层优化景观仍未被充分理解。

Method: 采用自相关分析方法，在语义嵌入空间中对两种提示生成策略（系统枚举和新颖驱动多样化）进行了实验。

Result: 实验发现，系统提示生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，而多样化生成则显示非单调模式，表明景观具有崎岖和层次化结构。

Conclusion: 本研究通过自相关分析揭示了提示工程中优化景观的拓扑结构差异，为理解提示优化的复杂性提供了实证基础。

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个名为‘Code Like Humans’的新框架，用于医疗编码领域，该框架能够支持完整的ICD-10编码系统（超过7万个标签），并在罕见诊断代码上取得了最佳性能。同时，文章还分析了系统性能并识别了其‘盲点’（系统性编码不足的代码）。

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric
codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new
agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements
official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that
can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best
performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative
classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are
limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system
performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically
undercoded).

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

TL;DR: 提出一种多智能体系统，直接在街景图像上生成自行车设施设计，适应多种场景，为交通规划提供快速、真实的视觉渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的街景设计渲染方法劳动密集，阻碍了集体审议和协作决策。AI辅助生成设计虽有潜力，但现有方法需要大量领域特定训练数据，且难以在复杂街景中实现精确的空间变化。

Method: 引入了一个多智能体系统，直接在真实世界街景图像上编辑和重新设计自行车设施。该框架集成了车道定位、提示优化、设计生成和自动化评估，以合成真实且符合上下文的设计。

Result: 实验表明，该系统能适应不同的道路几何形状和环境条件，持续产生视觉连贯且符合指令的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为应用多智能体管道于交通基础设施规划和设施设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TreeGPT提出了一种结合Transformer和树结构聚合的新架构，显著提升了程序合成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在AST处理上依赖序列处理或图神经网络，无法充分捕捉树结构的层次特性，因此需要一种更有效的架构。

Method: 采用混合设计，结合自注意力机制捕捉局部依赖和TreeFFN建模层次树结构，通过全局父子聚合机制迭代传递信息。

Result: 在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于基线和其他方法，且参数仅1.5M。

Conclusion: TreeGPT通过结合Transformer注意力机制和全局父子聚合机制，在神经程序合成任务中实现了显著性能提升，特别是在处理AST时表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在3D空间理解方面存在不足，主要由于缺乏有效的3D表示和大规模3D视觉语言预训练。OccVLA旨在解决这些挑战，提供可扩展且完全基于视觉的自动驾驶解决方案。

Method: 该方法采用3D占用表示作为预测输出和监督信号，直接从2D视觉输入中学习细粒度空间结构，无需显式3D输入或额外计算开销。

Result: OccVLA在nuScenes基准测试中实现了最先进的轨迹规划性能，并在3D视觉问答任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: OccVLA提出了一种新颖的框架，通过将3D占用表示整合到多模态推理过程中，显著提升了自动驾驶中的3D空间理解能力，且在nuScenes基准测试中实现了最先进的轨迹规划性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

TL;DR: MSRFormer 是一种新型道路网络表示学习框架，通过多尺度空间交互和对比学习，显著提升了复杂道路网络结构的分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市道路网络的异质性和层次性对准确表示学习提出了挑战，而现有的图神经网络由于同质性假设和单一结构尺度的限制，难以有效应对。

Method: MSRFormer 集成了多尺度空间交互，通过空间流卷积从大型轨迹数据集中提取小尺度特征，并使用图变换器捕捉跨多尺度的复杂空间依赖关系。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的验证表明，MSRFormer 在两项道路网络分析任务中优于基线方法，性能提升高达16%。

Conclusion: MSRFormer 提供了一个实用的框架，用于开发任务无关的道路网络表示模型，并揭示了空间交互的尺度效应与流动异质性之间独特的关联模式。

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

Method: 提出了MIND框架，包括构建元知识记忆库以实现自我意识、利用博弈论交互监控知识激活，以及通过标签细化实现噪声鲁棒更新。

Result: MIND在传统和元认知知识编辑基准上表现优异，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: MIND框架在传统和元认知知识编辑基准上表现出色，显著优于现有认知编辑方法。

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 本文总结了双曲几何在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的应用，并提出了未来研究方向，强调了其在增强语义表示学习和多尺度推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,
datasets, and code implementations is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测-优化（PTO）方法因预测与优化分离导致决策次优，而DFL方法虽能克服此限制，但在实际应用中的可行性尚未充分验证。

Method: 提出了AFE-DFL框架，结合自动特征工程和决策聚焦学习，用于预测电价和需求并优化BESS操作。

Result: 实验表明，DFL比PTO平均降低了运营成本，且AFE进一步提升了DFL性能22.9-56.5%。

Conclusion: 研究通过结合自动特征工程（AFE）和决策聚焦学习（DFL），提出了AFE-DFL框架，显著提升了BESS操作的性能，并验证了DFL在现实场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

Motivation: 提升患者对医疗护理的主动参与和理解能力。

Method: 使用两阶段训练：初始监督微调于合成生成的医疗对话数据，随后通过基于患者理解评估的强化学习（PPO）。

Result: NoteAid-Chatbot在模拟医院出院场景中表现出关键的患者教育行为，如清晰度、相关性和结构化对话，且在非专家人类测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

Conclusion: MapAgent在四个不同的地理空间基准测试中表现出色，显著优于现有工具增强和代理基线，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at

Motivation: 现有的基于规则的奖励函数仅评估答案格式和正确性，无法反映Chain-of-Thought (CoT)对答案的实际提升，且缺乏对逻辑深度的控制。

Method: 提出了Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER)框架，包括Reasoning Quality Reward和Dynamic Length Advantage两部分，用于优化RL奖励信号。

Result: 7B模型在Logictree上达到GPT-o3-mini水平，CoT增强答案的平均置信度提升30%，并在其他逻辑推理数据集和AIME24数学基准上表现良好。

Conclusion: DRER框架有效提升了大型语言模型的推理能力，并在Logictree数据集上实现了高性能，同时展示了跨数据集的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Conclusion: EDIT方法通过动态推理修剪显著提高了大型推理模型的效率，生成简洁且正确的推理路径，改善了可读性和用户体验。

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user

Abstract: LLM-based agents have shown promise in various cooperative and strategic
reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in competitive multi-agent
environments remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
PillagerBench, a novel framework for evaluating multi-agent systems in
real-time competitive team-vs-team scenarios in Minecraft. It provides an
extensible API, multi-round testing, and rule-based built-in opponents for
fair, reproducible comparisons. We also propose TactiCrafter, an LLM-based
multi-agent system that facilitates teamwork through human-readable tactics,
learns causal dependencies, and adapts to opponent strategies. Our evaluation
demonstrates that TactiCrafter outperforms baseline approaches and showcases
adaptive learning through self-play. Additionally, we analyze its learning
process and strategic evolution over multiple game episodes. To encourage
further research, we have open-sourced PillagerBench, fostering advancements in
multi-agent AI for competitive environments.

*Manvi Jha,Jiaxin Wan,Deming Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proof2Silicon是一个端到端合成框架，通过RL优化提示生成和自动代码转换，成功将自然语言规范转化为形式验证的硬件设计，验证成功率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在自动代码生成方面表现出色，但其生成的代码常无法通过形式验证，这在硬件和安全关键领域是基本要求。

Method: 1. 利用PREFACE的验证驱动RL代理迭代优化提示生成，确保Dafny代码正确性；2. 自动将验证后的Dafny程序转换为可合成的高级C代码；3. 使用Vivado HLS生成RTL实现。

Result: 在100个任务的基准测试中，PREFACE的RL引导提示优化将Dafny验证成功率提高了21%，Proof2Silicon的端到端硬件合成成功率高达72%。

Conclusion: Proof2Silicon成功构建了一个从自然语言规范到硅实现的自动化、可扩展且稳健的管道，显著提高了硬件合成的成功率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language
specification and silicon realization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化AI助手难以整合复杂的个人数据和因果知识，导致建议缺乏解释性和个性化。

Method: REMI架构整合了个人因果知识图谱、因果推理引擎和基于模式的规划模块，利用大型语言模型协调这些组件，生成具有透明因果解释的答案。

Result: 基于CSM的代理能够提供比基线LLM代理更具上下文感知和用户对齐的推荐，通过新的评估指标（如个性化显著性分数和因果推理准确性）验证了其性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新颖的个性化AI助手架构REMI，通过结合因果知识图谱和规划模块，能够提供更具解释性和个性化的建议。实验证明，基于CSM的代理在上下文感知和用户对齐方面优于基线LLM代理，推动了透明可信赖AI生活方式助手的发展。

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal
data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice that lacks explanatory
power. We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal
lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal
reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver
explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in
personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy
AI lifestyle assistants.

TL;DR: TableMind是一个LLM驱动的表格推理代理，通过自主多轮工具调用、代码执行及策略自适应，显著提升了表格推理的准确性和计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纯文本方法在复杂数值计算和细粒度操作上的不足，以及现有工具集成系统缺乏真正自主适应性的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段微调范式：首先在高质量推理轨迹上进行监督微调，建立有效的工具使用模式；随后通过强化微调优化多目标策略，特别是提出了Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO)方法。

Result: TableMind在多个主流基准测试中表现优于竞争基线，显著提升了推理准确性和计算精度。

Conclusion: TableMind通过在多个主流基准测试中的优异表现，证明了其在表格推理任务中的优越性能，显著提升了推理准确性和计算精度。

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

*Jiaxiang Chen,Zhuo Wang,Mingxi Zou,Zhucong Li,Zhijian Zhou,Song Wang,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结构化推理框架，通过指导和细化提升LLM推理稳定性与泛化能力，实验证明在多任务中优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖隐式探索，导致推理路径不稳定、缺乏错误纠正和从过去经验中学习有限。为了解决这些问题，提出了结构化推理框架。

Method: 提出了一种框架，从隐式探索转向结构化推理，通过指导和细化来实现。首先从成功轨迹中提取结构化推理模式，并从失败中获取反思信号。在推理过程中，模型逐步遵循这些指导，并在每一步后应用细化以纠正错误并稳定推理过程。

Result: 在BBH和其他四个基准测试（GSM8K、MATH-500、MBPP、HumanEval）上，该方法始终优于强基线，展示了稳定性和泛化能力的提升。

Conclusion: 结构化推理通过逐步执行和细化提高了稳定性和泛化能力，指导在不同领域间转移良好，灵活支持跨模型协作，在效果和可扩展性上匹配或超越监督微调。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

### [248] [Can AI Make Energy Retrofit Decisions? An Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06307)
*Lei Shu,Dong Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM在能源改造决策中表现良好，技术目标优于社会技术目标，但需改进一致性和上下文处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统能源改造决策方法通用性低且解释性差，阻碍了在多样化住宅环境中的应用。生成式AI（如LLM）可能通过处理上下文信息并提供可读建议来解决这一问题。

Method: 评估了七种LLM（如ChatGPT、DeepSeek等）在住宅改造决策中的表现，基于准确性、一致性、敏感性和推理四个维度，使用美国49个州的400个住宅数据集。

Result: LLM在许多情况下能生成有效建议，技术目标表现更佳（最高54.5%的Top 1匹配率），但社会技术决策受经济权衡和本地环境影响。模型间一致性低，高表现模型倾向于与其他模型不同。

Conclusion: LLMs在能源改造决策中展现出潜力，但在准确性、一致性和上下文处理方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

Conclusion: 本研究为基于LLM的问卷调查模拟建立了严谨的基础，为社会学研究和政策评估提供了可扩展且经济高效的工具。

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个多轮评估框架，用于衡量电子商务对话中卖家代理的议价能力，强调LLMs作为卖家代理在长期谈判中跟踪和准确解读买家意图的重要性。

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated
pipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original
game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool
for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior
generation.

DiagCoT combines contrastive image-report tuning for domain alignment,
chain-of-thought supervision to capture inferential logic, and reinforcement
tuning with clinical reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and fluency. On

Motivation: 解决长上下文任务中信息利用不足（如中间信息丢失）的问题，避免现有方法的输入缩减或注意力分散缺陷。

Method: 提出Tree of Agents（TOA）框架，将输入分块并由独立智能体处理，结合前缀哈希缓存和自适应剪枝策略提升效率。

Result: 实验表明TOA在多项长上下文任务中优于基线模型，性能接近大型商业模型如Gemini1.5-pro。

Conclusion: TOA框架通过多智能体协作和树状信息交换，有效解决了长上下文任务中的信息利用问题，性能显著优于现有基线，并与大型商业模型相媲美。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式RAG管道在处理异构和隐私敏感数据（尤其是分布式医疗保健环境中跨越SQL、知识图谱和临床笔记的患者数据）时遇到困难，传统云基RAG系统在处理多样格式和边缘设备时存在局限性。

Method: 设计了一个基于Flower的边缘-云协作RAG框架，支持查询结构化SQL数据、半结构化知识图谱和非结构化文档。边缘侧LLM将多样数据转换为标准化的隐私保护表示，服务器侧LLM整合它们进行全局推理和生成。

Result: 在PMC-Patients上的实验结果表明，HyFedRAG在检索质量、生成一致性和系统效率方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: HyFedRAG提供了一个可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案，适用于结构异构数据的RAG，释放了LLM在敏感和多样化数据环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

Result: 实验结果表明，相比现有基线方法，该方法能够以更快的速度持续提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的指令数据选择方法，通过最大化指令深度和语义覆盖来持续提升模型性能，实现了“加速扩展”。

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高GUI代理在不同平台（如智能手机和计算机）上的效率，结合灵活GUI操作和高效快捷方式（如API、深层链接）的混合范式是一个有前景的方向，但目前缺乏系统评估这类混合代理的框架。

Method: 引入MAS-Bench，一个专注于移动领域的基准测试，评估GUI-快捷方式混合代理的能力，包括自主生成快捷方式的能力。

Result: 实验表明，混合代理比纯GUI代理具有显著更高的成功率和效率，验证了评估代理快捷方式生成能力的有效性。

Conclusion: MAS-Bench填补了GUI-快捷方式混合代理评估的关键空白，为未来创建更高效、更稳健的智能代理提供了基础平台。

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理中需要平衡多个冲突目标（如成本降低、服务水平提升和环境可持续性），传统多目标优化方法难以适应供应链的动态性。

Method: 结合强化学习（RL）和多目标进化算法（MOEAs），利用MOEAs搜索策略神经网络的参数空间，生成帕累托前沿策略。引入条件风险价值（CVaR）以增强风险敏感决策。

Result: 通过案例研究展示了方法的有效性，在库存管理案例中优于现有方法，能够动态响应供应链变化。

Conclusion: 提出的策略不仅提高了决策效率，还为供应链中的不确定性管理和性能优化提供了更稳健的框架。

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

TL;DR: 本文提出	exttt{BFS-Prover-V2}系统，通过多轮RL框架和多智能体搜索架构，解决了LLM在自动定理证明中的扩展问题，在形式数学基准测试中取得最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动定理证明中的集成显示出巨大潜力，但受限于训练时强化学习（RL）和推理时计算的扩展问题。本文旨在解决这一双重扩展问题。

Method: 本文介绍了两个主要创新：1. 一种新颖的多轮离策略RL框架，用于持续提升训练时LLM步骤证明器的性能，该框架采用多阶段专家迭代流程，结合自适应战术级数据过滤和周期性重训练；2. 一个规划器增强的多智能体搜索架构，用于在推理时扩展推理能力，该架构利用通用推理模型作为高级规划器，迭代将复杂定理分解为更简单的子目标。

Result: 	exttt{BFS-Prover-V2}在MiniF2F和ProofNet测试集上分别达到了95.08%和41.4%的准确率，展现了其在形式数学领域的领先性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的	exttt{BFS-Prover-V2}系统在形式数学领域取得了最先进的结果，证明了其在自动定理证明中的有效性。虽然应用于形式数学领域，但其RL和推理技术具有广泛适用性，可推广至其他需要长序列多轮推理和复杂搜索的领域。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed

Motivation: 针对多模态大模型中复杂跨模态推理的“捷径”问题和上下文理解不足的问题，该论文旨在通过模拟人类认知策略的“意图草图”来提升推理效果。

Method: 论文提出了一种由意图感知器、策略生成器和策略选择器组成的三模块管道，明确构建了“理解-计划-选择”的认知过程，通过生成和过滤“意图草图”策略来指导最终推理。

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 本文系统总结了深度研究系统中强化学习的基础，提供了训练稳健、透明深度研究代理的实用指南，并指出了基础设施瓶颈。

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

Motivation: 传统FC方法在智能车辆座舱环境中效率低下且错误恢复能力有限，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了State-based Function Call（SFC）方法，通过显式系统状态感知和直接状态转换实现目标条件。

Result: 实验证明SFC在多种挑战性场景中表现优于传统FC，并公开了所有实现代码。

Conclusion: SFC（基于状态的函数调用）在汽车智能座舱环境中显著优于传统FC方法，提供了更高的执行准确性和更低的延迟。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估框架，通过多轮对话和针对性指标，量化分析迭代在不同任务中的效果，发现领域依赖性明显，并明确了何时使用何种策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在多轮工作流中的应用日益广泛，但目前缺乏明确的方法来衡量迭代何时有效、何时有害。

Method: 通过控制12轮对话任务，使用不同类型的提示（从模糊反馈到针对性引导），并记录每轮输出。采用领域适当的检查（如代码的单元测试、数学的答案等价性和推理合理性、创意的原创性和可行性）和三类指标（语义变化、轮间变化、输出大小增长）来评估迭代效果。

Result: 迭代效果因领域而异：创意和代码早期见效，数学则需要后期引导；模糊反馈常导致效果停滞或倒退，而针对性提示能稳定提升质量。不同领域也呈现一致模式：创意的语义变化大，代码输出大小增长但语义变化小，数学初期固定但后期可通过详细迭代突破。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个可衡量和比较不同模型迭代效果的框架和指标，帮助决定何时引导、停止或切换策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

Motivation: 当前的长周期、多组件 LLM 代理系统开发面临评估能力不足的问题，现有方法局限于单一指标或端到端结果，缺乏对复杂逻辑的长期推理能力。

Method: RAFFLES 是一个迭代的多组件评估架构，通过中央法官系统调查故障，并利用一组专门的评估器不仅评估系统组件，还评估法官自身的推理质量。

Result: RAFFLES 在 Who&When 数据集上的表现优于基线，算法生成数据集上的代理-步骤故障对准确率达到 43%以上（较之前最佳 16.6%有显著提升），手工制作数据集上的准确率超过 20%（超越之前最佳 8.8%）。

Conclusion: RAFFLES 架构在自动化故障检测方面取得了显著进展，超越了现有基线，为减少人工审查的劳动强度提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

Motivation: 测试时间扩展在许多领域表现出色，但在知识密集型任务中效果不佳，需要高事实准确性和低幻觉率。

Method: 对12种推理模型在两个知识密集型基准上进行全面评估，分析扩展推理如何影响幻觉行为。

Result: 增加测试时间计算并不一致提高准确性，甚至可能导致更多幻觉。减少的幻觉通常是因为模型选择放弃回答，而非事实回忆的改进。

Conclusion: 尽管测试时间扩展在某些情况下会增加幻觉率，但相比不进行思考，启用思考仍然是有益的。

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Conclusion: Paper2Agent通过将静态研究论文转化为动态、交互式的AI代理，为知识传播引入了新范式，并为AI协作生态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

Conclusion: 通过引入Direct-Align和SRPO方法，论文显著提升了扩散模型在人类偏好对齐上的效率和效果，减少了计算成本和对离线奖励调整的依赖。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

TL;DR: ManipDreamer3D是一个新颖框架，通过3D轨迹规划和扩散模型生成逼真的3D感知机器人操作视频，减少人工干预并提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺是机器人操作领域的主要挑战，现有方法依赖2D轨迹，存在3D空间模糊性问题。

Method: 结合3D轨迹规划与从第三人称视角重建的3D占用地图，以及新型轨迹到视频的扩散模型，首先生成3D占用表示，再计算优化的3D末端执行器轨迹，最后通过潜在编辑技术生成视频序列。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ManipDreamer3D成功生成具有自主规划的3D轨迹的机器人操作视频，显著减少了人工干预需求，并在视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生物与人工系统通过LLM介导的无缝交互，构建具有自主响应能力的混合生命体。

Method: 利用LLM模块（感知、视觉、对话、行动）通过自然语言异步通信，将多模态数据转换为语言消息，协调系统行为。

Result: Plantbot作为具身自适应代理，能自主响应环境条件，展示了生物与人工系统交互的潜力。

Conclusion: Plantbot展示了通过LLM模块协调生物与人工系统交互的新模型，为人工生命研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce Plantbot, a hybrid lifeform that connects a living plant with a
mobile robot through a network of large language model (LLM) modules. Each
module - responsible for sensing, vision, dialogue, or action - operates
asynchronously and communicates via natural language, enabling seamless
interaction across biological and artificial domains. This architecture
leverages the capacity of LLMs to serve as hybrid interfaces, where natural
language functions as a universal protocol, translating multimodal data (soil
moisture, temperature, visual context) into linguistic messages that coordinate
system behaviors. The integrated network transforms plant states into robotic
actions, installing normativity essential for agency within the sensor-motor
loop. By combining biological and robotic elements through LLM-mediated
communication, Plantbot behaves as an embodied, adaptive agent capable of
responding autonomously to environmental conditions. This approach suggests
possibilities for a new model of artificial life, where decentralized, LLM
modules coordination enable novel interactions between biological and
artificial systems.

Abstract: We introduce a general, scalable computational framework for multi-axis 3D
printing based on implicit neural fields (INFs) that unifies all stages of
toolpath generation and global collision-free motion planning. In our pipeline,
input models are represented as signed distance fields, with fabrication
objectives such as support-free printing, surface finish quality, and extrusion
control being directly encoded in the optimization of an implicit guidance
field. This unified approach enables toolpath optimization across both surface
and interior domains, allowing shell and infill paths to be generated via
implicit field interpolation. The printing sequence and multi-axis motion are
then jointly optimized over a continuous quaternion field. Our continuous
formulation constructs the evolving printing object as a time-varying SDF,
supporting differentiable global collision handling throughout INF-based motion
planning. Compared to explicit-representation-based methods, INF-3DP achieves
up to two orders of magnitude speedup and significantly reduces
waypoint-to-surface error. We validate our framework on diverse, complex models
and demonstrate its efficiency with physical fabrication experiments using a
robot-assisted multi-axis system.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous drone swarms in disaster response missions
necessitates the development of flexible, scalable, and robust coordination
systems. Traditional fixed architectures struggle to cope with dynamic and
unpredictable environments, leading to inefficiencies in energy consumption and
connectivity. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an adaptive
architecture for drone swarms, leveraging a Large Language Model to dynamically
select the optimal architecture as centralized, hierarchical, or holonic based
on real time mission parameters such as task complexity, swarm size, and
communication stability. Our system addresses the challenges of scalability,
adaptability, and robustness,ensuring efficient energy consumption and
maintaining connectivity under varying conditions. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our adaptive architecture outperforms traditional static
models in terms of scalability, energy efficiency, and connectivity. These
results highlight the potential of our approach to provide a scalable,
adaptable, and resilient solution for real world disaster response scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管在训练尖峰神经网络（SNNs）进行分类方面取得了进展，但它们在连续运动控制中的应用仍然有限。

Method: 结合Leaky Integrate-and-Fire动态和替代梯度的预测控制框架，联合优化用于动态预测的前向模型和用于目标导向动作的策略网络。

Result: SNNs可以实现稳定训练和精确扭矩控制，证明了它们在高维运动任务中的可行性。

Conclusion: 尽管可以稳定有效地实现控制，但循环尖峰网络对超参数设置仍然高度敏感，强调了原则性设计选择的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited.
Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end
to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous
environments. Our predictive-control framework combines Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients, jointly optimizing a
forward model for dynamics prediction and a policy network for goal-directed
action. We evaluate this approach on both a planar 2D reaching task and a
simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that SNNs can achieve
stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for
high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role
of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping
training dynamics. We conclude that while stable and effective control can be
achieved, recurrent spiking networks remain highly sensitive to hyperparameter
settings, underscoring the importance of principled design choices.

Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences
presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in
understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships
between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that
incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code
generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence,
which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal
coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code
generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code
reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness
and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly
enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and
code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and
spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce
LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action
sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial
complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that
existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework
establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.

Conclusion: 该研究通过强化学习和图神经网络，成功实现了多机器人任务分配、调度和运动规划的自动化，展示了其在复杂环境中的高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple
robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although
individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation,
scheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain
computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales.
Existing multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and
experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive
process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an
obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a
shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our
approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on
procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot
configurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of
scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning
to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems
of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly
generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen
settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We
further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its
use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and
scalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as
fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid
adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.

Conclusion: HapMorph通过拮抗织物气动执行器（AFPAs）实现了多维度触觉反馈，为下一代触觉交互设备提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Haptic interfaces that can simultaneously modulate multiple physical
properties remain a fundamental challenge in human-robot interaction. Existing
systems typically allow the rendering of either geometric features or
mechanical properties, but rarely both, within wearable form factors. Here, we
introduce HapMorph, a pneumatic framework that enables continuous, simultaneous
modulation of object size and stiffness through antagonistic fabric-based
pneumatic actuators (AFPAs). We implemented a HapMorph protoytpe designed for
hands interaction achieving size variation from 50 to 104 mm, stiffness
modulation up to 4.7 N/mm and mass of the wearable parts of just 21 g. Through
systematic characterization, we demonstrate decoupled control of size and
stiffness properties via dual-chamber pressure regulation. Human perception
studies with 10 participants reveal that users can distinguish nine discrete
states across three size categories and three stiffness levels with 89.4%
accuracy and 6.7 s average response time. We further demonstrate extended
architectures that combine AFPAs with complementary pneumatic structures to
enable shape or geometry morphing with concurrent stiffness control. Our
results establish antagonistic pneumatic principle as a pathway toward
next-generation haptic interfaces, capable of multi-dimensiona rendering
properties within practical wearable constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous regolith excavation is a cornerstone of in-situ resource
utilization for a sustained human presence beyond Earth. However, this task is
fundamentally hindered by the complex interaction dynamics of granular media
and the operational need for robots to use diverse tools. To address these
challenges, this work introduces a framework where a model-based reinforcement
learning agent learns within a parallelized simulation. This environment
leverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a
vast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To
master this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by
dynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step
through operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training
with a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and
enables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Furthermore, we
show that augmenting the agent with visual feedback significantly improves task
success. These results represent a validated methodology for developing the
robust and versatile autonomous systems required for the foundational tasks of
future space missions.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合全局规划器和局部控制器，成功实现了在血管环境中实时避障和目标到达，为自主微型机器人导航和靶向药物输送提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Autonomous microrobots in blood vessels could enable minimally invasive
therapies, but navigation is challenged by dense, moving obstacles. We propose
a real-time path planning framework that couples an analytic geometry global
planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers, one based on rules
and one based on reinforcement learning, to handle sudden moving obstacles.
Using real-time imaging, the system estimates the positions of the microrobot,
obstacles, and targets and computes collision-free motions. In simulation, AGP
yields shorter paths and faster planning than weighted A* (WA*), particle swarm
optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), while maintaining
feasibility and determinism. We extend AGP from 2D to 3D without loss of speed.
In both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local
controllers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. The average
planning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps image acquisition and
real-time closed-loop control. These results advance autonomous microrobot
navigation and targeted drug delivery in vascular environments.

Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to enable the robot to learn natural-looking
movements while maintaining physical stability. We develop tailored domain
randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to ensure safe
sim-to-real, protecting valuable hardware components during deployment. Our

Abstract: Detecting and localizing glass in 3D environments poses significant
challenges for visual perception systems, as the optical properties of glass
often hinder conventional sensors from accurately distinguishing glass
surfaces. The lack of real-world datasets focused on glass objects further
impedes progress in this field. To address this issue, we introduce a new
dataset featuring a wide range of glass configurations with precise 3D
annotations, collected from distinct real-world scenarios. On the basis of this
dataset, we propose MonoGlass3D, a novel approach tailored for monocular 3D
glass detection across diverse environments. To overcome the challenges posed
by the ambiguous appearance and context diversity of glass, we propose an
adaptive feature fusion module that empowers the network to effectively capture
contextual information in varying conditions. Additionally, to exploit the
distinct planar geometry of glass surfaces, we present a plane regression

Motivation: 提高远程环境中与遥操作机器人交互的效率和直观性。

Method: 开发并评估了一种共享控制方法，机器人自主导航的同时允许用户影响路径生成。并与控制切换方法（用户在直接和自动控制之间切换）进行了比较。

Result: 共享控制不会降低导航效率，但相比控制切换未能显著减少任务负荷。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究探索影响用户偏好和性能的潜在因素。

Abstract: Telepresence robots enable users to interact with remote environments, but
efficient and intuitive navigation remains a challenge. In this work, we
developed and evaluated a shared control method, in which the robot navigates
autonomously while allowing users to affect the path generation to better suit
their needs. We compared this with control switching, where users toggle
between direct and automated control. We hypothesized that shared control would
maintain efficiency comparable to control switching while potentially reducing
user workload. The results of two consecutive user studies (each with final
sample of n=20) showed that shared control does not degrade navigation
efficiency, but did not show a significant reduction in task load compared to
control switching. Further research is needed to explore the underlying factors
that influence user preference and performance in these control systems.

Motivation: 提升自主导航系统的环境适应性，解决机器人路径规划中的基本挑战。

Method: 结合A-star算法的曼哈顿距离启发式与PRM的随机采样过程，采用分层采样策略和动态连接机制。

Result: 在基准配置下，A-star PRM的路径长度比PRM缩短42.3%，计算时间增加仅为PRM的71%。高密度采样时路径长度进一步减少0.94%，计算时间增加显著降低。

Conclusion: A-star PRM算法在路径质量、稳定性和计算效率方面展现出全面优势，尤其在狭窄通道和动态障碍物场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Robot path planning is a fundamental challenge in enhancing the environmental
adaptability of autonomous navigation systems. This paper presents a hybrid
path planning algorithm, A-star PRM, which incorporates dynamic weights. By
embedding the Manhattan distance heuristic of the A-star algorithm into the
random sampling process of PRM, the algorithm achieves a balanced optimization
of path quality and computational efficiency. The approach uses a hierarchical
sampling strategy and a dynamic connection mechanism, greatly improving
adaptability to complex obstacle distributions. Experiments show that under a
baseline configuration with one thousand sampled vertices, the path length of
A-star PRM is 1073.23 plus or minus 14.8 meters and is 42.3 percent shorter
than that of PRM with p value less than 0.01. With high-density sampling using
three thousand vertices, the path length is reduced by 0.94 percent, 1036.61
meters compared with 1046.42 meters, while the increase in computational time
is cut to about one tenth of the PRM increase, 71 percent compared with 785
percent. These results confirm the comprehensive advantages of A-star PRM in
path quality, stability, and computational efficiency. Compared with existing
hybrid algorithms, the proposed method shows clear benefits, especially in
narrow channels and scenarios with dynamic obstacles.

Abstract: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is a foundational technique for autonomous
systems, yet its deployment on resource-constrained platforms remains
challenging due to computational and memory limitations. We propose Super-LIO,
a robust LIO system that demands both high performance and accuracy, ideal for
applications such as aerial robots and mobile autonomous systems. At the core
of Super-LIO is a compact octo-voxel-based map structure, termed OctVox, that
limits each voxel to eight fused subvoxels, enabling strict point density
control and incremental denoising during map updates. This design enables a
simple yet efficient and accurate map structure, which can be easily integrated
into existing LIO frameworks. Additionally, Super-LIO designs a
heuristic-guided KNN strategy (HKNN) that accelerates the correspondence search
by leveraging spatial locality, further reducing runtime overhead. We evaluated
the proposed system using four publicly available datasets and several
self-collected datasets, totaling more than 30 sequences. Extensive testing on
both X86 and ARM platforms confirms that Super-LIO offers superior efficiency
and robustness, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Super-LIO processes
each frame approximately 73% faster than SOTA, while consuming less CPU
resources. The system is fully open-source and plug-and-play compatible with a
wide range of LiDAR sensors and platforms. The implementation is available at:

Abstract: Game-based interactive driving simulations have emerged as versatile
platforms for advancing decision-making algorithms in road transport mobility.
While these environments offer safe, scalable, and engaging settings for
testing driving strategies, ensuring both realism and robust performance amid
dynamic and diverse scenarios remains a significant challenge. Recently, the
integration of game-based techniques with advanced learning frameworks has
enabled the development of adaptive decision-making models that effectively
manage the complexities inherent in varied driving conditions. These models
outperform traditional simulation methods, especially when addressing
scenario-specific challenges, ranging from obstacle avoidance on highways and
precise maneuvering during on-ramp merging to navigation in roundabouts,
unsignalized intersections, and even the high-speed demands of autonomous
racing. Despite numerous innovations in game-based interactive driving, a
systematic review comparing these approaches across different scenarios is
still missing. This survey provides a comprehensive evaluation of game-based
interactive driving methods by summarizing recent advancements and inherent
roadway features in each scenario. Furthermore, the reviewed algorithms are
critically assessed based on their adaptation of the standard game model and an

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at

Abstract: With the rapid development of the warehousing and logistics industries, the
packing of goods has gradually attracted the attention of academia and
industry. The packing of footwear products is a typical representative
paired-item packing task involving irregular shapes and deformable objects.
Although studies on shoe packing have been conducted, different initial states
due to the irregular shapes of shoes and standard packing placement poses have
not been considered. This study proposes a robotic manipulation framework,
including a perception module, reorientation planners, and a packing planner,
that can complete the packing of pairs of shoes in any initial state. First, to
adapt to the large intraclass variations due to the state, shape, and
deformation of the shoe, we propose a vision module based on semantic
keypoints, which can also infer more information such as size, state, pose, and
manipulation points by combining geometric features. Subsequently, we not only
proposed primitive-based reorientation methods for different states of a single
deformable shoe but also proposed a fast reorientation method for the top state
using box edge contact and gravity, which further improved the efficiency of
reorientation. Finally, based on the perception module and reorientation
methods, we propose a task planner for shoe pair packing in any initial state
to provide an optimal packing strategy. Real-world experiments were conducted
to verify the robustness of the reorientation methods and the effectiveness of
the packing strategy for various types of shoes. In this study, we highlight
the potential of semantic keypoint representation methods, introduce new
perspectives on the reorientation of 3D deformable objects and multi-object
manipulation, and provide a reference for paired object packing.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种解决OMEPP问题的高效算法，通过并发PCPD搜索显著提高了计算效率，同时保持了接近最优的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operate on battery power, making energy
efficiency a critical consideration, particularly in outdoor environments where
terrain variations affect energy consumption. While prior research has
primarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a
destination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot
needs to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact
energy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the
Object-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses
energy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one
of many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,
we first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a
variant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit
each pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from
high computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To
mitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages
multiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to
our solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of
the Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints. We
demonstrate that PCPD significantly reduces branching factors during search,
improving overall performance. Although the concurrent PCPD search may produce
slightly suboptimal solutions, extensive experiments on real-world datasets
show it achieves near-optimal performance while being one to two orders of
magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm.

Result: 实验结果表明，该规划器在复杂环境中显著提升了4WIS机器人的规划性能。

Conclusion: 提出的扩展Hybrid A*框架成功整合了多种运动模式，显著提升了4WIS机器人在复杂环境中的路径规划性能和适应性。

Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a
rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and
parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained
environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single
kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of
4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A*
framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both
spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal
Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each
motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for
mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with
intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different
steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of
multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving
flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate
significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex
environments.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种兼容IEEE 802.11的混合TDMA/CSMA协议，有效解决了高负载机器人通信中CSMA导致的延迟和碰撞问题，显著提升了关键任务的实时性和控制稳定性。

Abstract: Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control
in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems,
where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous
robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these
scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained
communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines,
otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In
this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted
in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic
loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time
arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an
IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's
deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot
traffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical
command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic
integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for
establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic
TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV
protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from
interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot
Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces
missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed
robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS)
trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while
maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

Abstract: Grasping of diverse objects in unstructured environments remains a
significant challenge. Open-loop grasping methods, effective in controlled
settings, struggle in cluttered environments. Grasp prediction errors and
object pose changes during grasping are the main causes of failure. In
contrast, closed-loop methods address these challenges in simplified settings
(e.g., single object on a table) on a limited set of objects, with no path to
generalization. We propose Grasp-MPC, a closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping
policy designed for robust and reactive grasping of novel objects in cluttered
environments. Grasp-MPC incorporates a value function, trained on visual
observations from a large-scale synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp
trajectories that include successful and failed attempts. We deploy this
learned value function in an MPC framework in combination with other cost terms
that encourage collision avoidance and smooth execution. We evaluate Grasp-MPC
on FetchBench and real-world settings across diverse environments. Grasp-MPC
improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in
real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy,
transformer policy, and IQL approaches. Videos and more at

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

Conclusion: DCReg通过其创新的检测、表征和缓解策略，显著提高了LiDAR点云配准在几何退化或狭窄环境中的准确性和稳定性，实现了至少20%-50%的精度提升和5-100倍的速度提升。

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud registration is fundamental to robotic perception and
navigation. However, in geometrically degenerate or narrow environments,
registration problems become ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions and
degraded accuracy. While existing approaches attempt to handle these issues,
they fail to address the core challenge: accurately detection, interpret, and
resolve this ill-conditioning, leading to missed detections or corrupted
solutions. In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that
systematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through
three integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning
detection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix.
This technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and
translational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy
patterns in conventional analyses. Second, within these cleanly subspaces, we
develop quantitative characterization techniques that establish explicit
mappings between mathematical eigenspaces and physical motion directions,
providing actionable insights about which specific motions lack constraints.
Finally, leveraging this clean subspace, we design a targeted mitigation
strategy: a novel preconditioner that selectively stabilizes only the
identified ill-conditioned directions while preserving all well-constrained
information in observable space. This enables efficient and robust optimization
via the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with a single physical
interpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at
least 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup
over state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments. Our implementation
will be available at https://github.com/JokerJohn/DCReg.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种MBRL框架，通过合成数据提高四足机器人步态控制的样本效率，实验验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于强化学习的步态控制器数据效率低，需要大量交互才能达到鲁棒性能，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用基于模型的强化学习（MBRL）框架，结合Dyna-Style范式，通过预测模型生成短时程合成数据，并逐步整合到PPO控制器的标准rollouts中。

Result: 实验表明，用合成数据替代部分模拟步骤不仅模拟了更长的rollouts，还提高了策略回报并降低了方差，同时减少了跟踪多种步态命令所需的模拟步骤。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的基于模型的强化学习框架通过合成数据提高了四足机器人步态控制的样本效率，并在仿真和实际机器人上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data
efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We
present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves
sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the
end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style
paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates
short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a
scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation
study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout
length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach
in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the
simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also
improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this
improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion
commands using fewer simulated steps.

Motivation: 解决腿式机器人在实际环境中需要鲁棒性和能效的需求，以及现有方法在仿真到现实转移中不可靠和忽视特定能耗的问题。

Method: 提出了一种整合仿真到现实强化学习与永磁同步电机物理基础能源模型的框架，采用四术语奖励和基于第一原理的能耗公式。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合仿真到现实的强化学习和基于物理的能源模型，显著提高了腿式机器人的能效和鲁棒性，且在多个平台上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Legged robots must achieve both robust locomotion and energy efficiency to be
practical in real-world environments. Yet controllers trained in simulation
often fail to transfer reliably, and most existing approaches neglect
actuator-specific energy losses or depend on complex, hand-tuned reward
formulations. We propose a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement
learning with a physics-grounded energy model for permanent magnet synchronous
motors. The framework requires a minimal parameter set to capture the
simulation-to-reality gap and employs a compact four-term reward with a
first-principle-based energetic loss formulation that balances electrical and
mechanical dissipation. We evaluate and validate the approach through a
bottom-up dynamic parameter identification study, spanning actuators,
full-robot in-air trajectories and on-ground locomotion. The framework is
tested on three primary platforms and deployed on ten additional robots,
demonstrating reliable policy transfer without randomization of dynamic
parameters. Our method improves energetic efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 32 percent reduction in the full Cost of Transport of
ANYmal (value 1.27). All code, models, and datasets will be released.

TL;DR: 提出ERPF-MPC方法，结合动态风险评估和MPC，优于传统方法，适用于复杂交互驾驶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型方法过于保守或计算密集，而学习型方法需要大量数据且泛化性差，RPF方法虽轻量但静态难以适应动态交通。

Method: 提出了一种进化风险势场（ERPF）方法，结合风险椭圆构造和自适应进化因子度量，动态更新风险评估，并集成到模型预测控制（MPC）框架中。

Result: ERPF-MPC方法在实验中表现出平滑轨迹、高平均速度和无碰撞导航。

Conclusion: ERPF-MPC方法在复杂交互驾驶环境中表现出色，提供了平滑的轨迹、更高的平均速度和无碰撞导航，是一种稳健且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort in interactive
autonomous driving has become a critical challenge. Traditional model-based
techniques, such as game-theoretic methods and robust control, are often overly
conservative or computationally intensive. Conversely, learning-based
approaches typically require extensive training data and frequently exhibit
limited interpretability and generalizability. Simpler strategies, such as Risk
Potential Fields (RPF), provide lightweight alternatives with minimal data
demands but are inherently static and struggle to adapt effectively to dynamic
traffic conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Evolutionary
Risk Potential Field (ERPF), a novel approach that dynamically updates risk
assessments in dynamical scenarios based on historical obstacle proximity data.
We introduce a Risk-Ellipse construct that combines longitudinal reach and
lateral uncertainty into a unified spatial temporal collision envelope.
Additionally, we define an adaptive Evolution Factor metric, computed through
sigmoid normalization of Time to Collision (TTC) and Time-Window-of-Hazard
(TWH), which dynamically adjusts the dimensions of the ellipse axes in real
time. This adaptive risk metric is integrated seamlessly into a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively
address complex interactive driving scenarios in terms of uncertain driving of
surrounding vehicles. Comprehensive comparative experiments demonstrate that
our ERPF-MPC approach consistently achieves smoother trajectories, higher
average speeds, and collision-free navigation, offering a robust and adaptive
solution suitable for complex interactive driving environments.

Motivation: 解决传统 MPC 实时执行时计算预算超限的问题，同时保持其安全约束处理能力。

Method: 提出了 Barrier-integrated Adaptive Neural Model Predictive Control (BAN-MPC) 框架，用 Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) 替代传统欧几里得距离以确保严格安全性，并集成离线学习的神经价值函数以降低在线计算复杂度。

Result: 硬件在环实验显示，BAN-MPC 比传统 MPC 快 200 倍，控制误差低于 5%，且在模型参数变化 15% 内无需重新训练。

Conclusion: BAN-MPC 框架通过结合神经网络的快速计算和 MPC 的约束处理能力，显著降低了实时计算复杂度，并在硬件在环实验中验证了其高效性和安全性。

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) enforces safety via constraints, its
real-time execution can exceed embedded compute budgets. We propose a
Barrier-integrated Adaptive Neural Model Predictive Control (BAN-MPC) framework
that synergizes neural networks' fast computation with MPC's
constraint-handling capability. To ensure strict safety, we replace traditional
Euclidean distance with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for collision
avoidance. We integrate an offline-learned neural value function into the
optimization objective of a Short-horizon MPC, substantially reducing online
computational complexity. Additionally, we use a second neural network to learn
the sensitivity of the value function to system parameters, and adaptively
adjust the neural value function based on this neural sensitivity when model
parameters change, eliminating the need for retraining and reducing offline
computation costs. The hardware in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on Jetson Nano
show that BAN-MPC solves 200 times faster than traditional MPC, enabling
collision-free navigation with control error below 5\% under model parameter
variations within 15\%, making it an effective embedded MPC alternative.

Abstract: Achieving efficient remote teleoperation is particularly challenging in
unknown environments, as the teleoperator must rapidly build an understanding
of the site's layout. Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this
challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site
from multiple perspectives. However, traditional online map-based teleoperation
systems struggle to generate visually accurate 3D maps in real-time due to the
high computational cost involved, leading to poor teleoperation performances.
In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in
unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient
GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and
existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed
solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its
performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The
results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more
accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation
efficiency. In doing so, our system enhances remote teleoperation by seamlessly
integrating photorealistic mapping generation with real-time performances,
enabling effective teleoperation in unfamiliar environments.

Abstract: Autonomous manipulation of granular media, such as sand, is crucial for
applications in construction, excavation, and additive manufacturing. However,
shaping granular materials presents unique challenges due to their
high-dimensional configuration space and complex dynamics, where traditional
rule-based approaches struggle without extensive engineering efforts.
Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling agents
to learn adaptive manipulation strategies through trial and error. In this
work, we present an RL framework that enables a robotic arm with a cubic
end-effector and a stereo camera to shape granular media into desired target
structures. We show the importance of compact observations and concise reward
formulations for the large configuration space, validating our design choices
with an ablation study. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach for the training of visual policies that manipulate granular
media including their real-world deployment, outperforming two baseline
approaches.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的ED-CBBA算法通过事件驱动通信机制有效减少了52%的消息传输，同时保持了CBBA的收敛性和性能界限，适用于多机器人任务分配场景。

Abstract: In various scenarios such as multi-drone surveillance and search-and-rescue
operations, deploying multiple robots is essential to accomplish multiple tasks
at once. Due to the limited communication range of these vehicles, a
decentralised task allocation algorithm is crucial for effective task
distribution among robots. The consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) has been
promising for multi-robot operation, offering theoretical guarantees. However,
CBBA demands continuous communication, leading to potential congestion and
packet loss that can hinder performance. In this study, we introduce an
event-driven communication mechanism designed to address these communication
challenges while maintaining the convergence and performance bounds of CBBA. We
demonstrate theoretically that the solution quality matches that of CBBA and
validate the approach with Monte-Carlo simulations across varying targets,
agents, and bundles. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm (ED-CBBA) can
reduce message transmissions by up to 52%.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合运动捕捉系统和SLAM内部跟踪，实现了多用户VR共位的高空间精度、舒适性、可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce a multi-user VR co-location framework that synchronizes users
within a shared virtual environment aligned to physical space. Our approach
combines a motion capture system with SLAM-based inside-out tracking to deliver
smooth, high-framerate, low-latency performance. Previous methods either rely
on continuous external tracking, which introduces latency and jitter, or on
one-time calibration, which cannot correct drift over time. In contrast, our
approach combines the responsiveness of local HMD SLAM tracking with the
flexibility to realign to an external source when needed. It also supports
real-time pose sharing across devices, ensuring consistent spatial alignment
and engagement between users. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework
achieves the spatial accuracy required for natural multi-user interaction while
offering improved comfort, scalability, and robustness over existing co-located
VR solutions.

Abstract: Accurate odometry is a critical component in a robotic navigation stack, and
subsequent modules such as planning and control often rely on an estimate of
the robot's motion. Sensor-based odometry approaches should be robust across
sensor types and deployable in different target domains, from solid-state
LiDARs mounted on cars in urban-driving scenarios to spinning LiDARs on
handheld packages used in unstructured natural environments. In this paper, we
propose a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system that does not rely on
sensor-specific modeling. Sensor fusion techniques for LiDAR and inertial
measurement unit (IMU) data typically integrate IMU data iteratively in a
Kalman filter or use pre-integration in a factor graph framework, combined with
LiDAR scan matching often exploiting some form of feature extraction. We
propose an alternative strategy that only requires a simplified motion model
for IMU integration and directly registers LiDAR scans in a scan-to-map
approach. Our approach allows us to impose a novel regularization on the LiDAR
registration, improving the overall odometry performance. We detail extensive
experiments on a number of datasets covering a wide array of commonly used
robotic sensors and platforms. We show that our approach works with the exact
same configuration in all these scenarios, demonstrating its robustness. We
have open-sourced our implementation so that the community can build further on
our work and use it in their navigation stacks.

Abstract: We present LiHRA, a novel dataset designed to facilitate the development of
automated, learning-based, or classical risk monitoring (RM) methods for
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios. The growing prevalence of
collaborative robots in industrial environments has increased the need for
reliable safety systems. However, the lack of high-quality datasets that
capture realistic human-robot interactions, including potentially dangerous
events, slows development. LiHRA addresses this challenge by providing a
comprehensive, multi-modal dataset combining 3D LiDAR point clouds, human body
keypoints, and robot joint states, capturing the complete spatial and dynamic
context of human-robot collaboration. This combination of modalities allows for
precise tracking of human movement, robot actions, and environmental
conditions, enabling accurate RM during collaborative tasks. The LiHRA dataset
covers six representative HRI scenarios involving collaborative and coexistent
tasks, object handovers, and surface polishing, with safe and hazardous
versions of each scenario. In total, the data set includes 4,431 labeled point
clouds recorded at 10 Hz, providing a rich resource for training and
benchmarking classical and AI-driven RM algorithms. Finally, to demonstrate
LiHRA's utility, we introduce an RM method that quantifies the risk level in
each scenario over time. This method leverages contextual information,
including robot states and the dynamic model of the robot. With its combination
of high-resolution LiDAR data, precise human tracking, robot state data, and
realistic collision events, LiHRA offers an essential foundation for future
research into real-time RM and adaptive safety strategies in human-robot
workspaces.

Abstract: Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide
range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual
operation or untransportable railway for movement. The AgriVLN method and the
A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the

Translator module translates the original instruction to be both refined and
precise. Being evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive coverage control method for a fleet of
off-road and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating in dynamic
(time-varying) agricultural environments. Traditional coverage control
approaches often assume static conditions, making them unsuitable for
real-world farming scenarios where obstacles, such as moving machinery and
uneven terrains, create continuous challenges. To address this, we propose a
real-time path planning framework that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) for obstacle detection and terrain assessment, allowing UGVs to
dynamically adjust their coverage paths. The environment is modeled as a
weighted directed graph, where the edge weights are continuously updated based
on the UAV observations to reflect obstacle motion and terrain variations. The
proposed approach incorporates Voronoi-based partitioning, adaptive edge weight
assignment, and cost-based path optimization to enhance navigation efficiency.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
improving path planning, reducing traversal costs, and maintaining robust
coverage in the presence of dynamic obstacles and muddy terrains.

Abstract: Deploying self-navigating surface vessels in inland waterways offers a
sustainable alternative to reduce road traffic congestion and emissions.
However, navigating confined waterways presents unique challenges, including

Existing methods for autonomous vessel navigation often lack the robustness or

incorporating channel borders and obstacles as safety constraints within the

Abstract: Micro Autonomous Surface Vehicles (MicroASVs) offer significant potential for
operations in confined or shallow waters and swarm robotics applications.
However, achieving precise and robust control at such small scales remains
highly challenging, mainly due to the complexity of modeling nonlinear
hydrodynamic forces and the increased sensitivity to self-motion effects and
environmental disturbances, including waves and boundary effects in confined
spaces. This paper presents a physics-driven dynamics model for an
over-actuated MicroASV and introduces a data-driven optimal control framework
that leverages a weak formulation-based online model learning method. Our
approach continuously refines the physics-driven model in real time, enabling
adaptive control that adjusts to changing system parameters. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances trajectory tracking
accuracy and robustness, even under unknown payloads and external disturbances.
These findings highlight the potential of data-driven online learning-based
optimal control to improve MicroASV performance, paving the way for more
reliable and precise autonomous surface vehicle operations.

Conclusion: LLaDA-VLA通过两种关键设计（局部特殊令牌分类策略和分层动作结构解码策略）成功将预训练的d-VLMs应用于机器人操作领域，显著优于现有VLA模型。

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

Motivation: 解决动态、部分可观测环境中机器人操纵器生成无碰撞运动的挑战，克服传统运动规划器需要全局环境知识和神经网络策略在复杂动态环境中泛化能力不足的问题。

Conclusion: DRP（Deep Reactive Policy）在动态、部分可观测环境中表现出色，成功率高，优于现有的经典和神经网络方法。

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

Motivation: 为了解决现有方法在长序列建模、长距离依赖捕捉和训练效率方面的不足，提出LocoMamba框架，旨在实现高效的跨模态深度强化学习。

Method: 1. 使用多层感知器嵌入本体感受状态，并通过轻量级卷积神经网络对深度图像进行分块处理，生成紧凑的令牌以改进状态表示。2. 通过堆叠的Mamba层进行近线性时间选择性扫描，融合令牌，降低延迟和内存占用，保持对令牌长度和图像分辨率的鲁棒性，并提供减轻过拟合的归纳偏置。3. 使用近端策略优化（PPO）在随机地形和外观以及障碍密度课程下进行端到端策略训练，采用紧凑的状态中心奖励平衡进度、平滑性和安全性。

Conclusion: LocoMamba框架在模拟环境中表现出色，相比现有基线方法，实现了更高的回报和成功率，减少了碰撞，并在未见过的地形和障碍密度上展现出更强的泛化能力，同时提高了训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

Abstract: Reducing the triangle count in complex 3D models is a basic geometry
preprocessing step in graphics pipelines such as efficient rendering and
interactive editing. However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit
a few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation,
a major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation.
Second, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need
to perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of
sharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can
take minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in
practice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh
optimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel
re-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and
intersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles;
(2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free
guarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the
simplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by
re-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm
demonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k
triangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090. We evaluated the approach on the Thingi10K
dataset and showcased its exceptional performance in geometry preservation and
speed.

Abstract: Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity,
architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension
level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance.
These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because
flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative
inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes
this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of
such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the
spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and
prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts
the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex
locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into
arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into
printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D
networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)
automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening
process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of
viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an
average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective
for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3
MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three
complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The
programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact,
integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting
structures in medical braces and splints.

Motivation: 手绘角色动画在保持几何一致性的同时表达生动的动态是一项挑战。传统骨骼动画方法难以处理复杂的非刚性元素，而视频扩散模型则容易在风格化绘图中产生几何失真。因此，需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的混合动画系统结合了骨骼动画和视频扩散模型，显著提升了手绘角色动画的几何一致性和动态表现力，尤其在处理复杂非刚性元素（如头发和裙子）时表现优异。

Abstract: Hand-drawn character animation is a vibrant field in computer graphics,
presenting challenges in achieving geometric consistency while conveying
expressive motion. Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric
consistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and
skirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models
synthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in
stylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation
system that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse
images are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for
geometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary
dynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an
inpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions
needing improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion
realism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in
the denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion
model enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural
deformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair
Layering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair
from the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters.
Extensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:
