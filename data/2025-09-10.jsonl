Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend\nto be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an\nalternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A\ngenerator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,\nand a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the\nplanner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started\nwith the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing\nlower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple\ntrajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the\nthreshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a\nsuccessful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success\nlikelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a\nsuccessful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a\nframework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in\nparallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting\ntrajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To\nplan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a\nvectorized motion planner. Our experiments show our approach improves over the\ntraditional generator-evaluator-planner framework across different objects,\ngenerators, and motion planners, and successfully generalizes to novel\nenvironments in the real world, including different shelves and table heights.\nProject website https://sites.google.com/view/fpte"}

First, polar\nregions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are\nestimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.\nThen, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap\npropagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.\nLastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories\nthat are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally,\nobstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps\nexist to robustify the overall planning framework.

To address this gap, we introduce PatchSeeker, a\nnovel method that leverages large language models to create rich semantic links\nbetween vulnerability descriptions and their VFCs. PatchSeeker generates\nembeddings from NVD descriptions and enhances commit messages by synthesizing\ndetailed summaries for those that are short or uninformative. These generated\nmessages act as a semantic bridge, effectively closing the information gap\nbetween natural language reports and low-level code changes. Our approach\nPatchSeeker achieves 59.3% higher MRR and 27.9% higher Recall@10 than the\nbest-performing baseline, Prospector, on the benchmark dataset. The extended\nevaluation on recent CVEs further confirms PatchSeeker's effectiveness.\nAblation study shows that both the commit message generation method and the\nselection of backbone LLMs make a positive contribution to PatchSeeker. We also\ndiscuss limitations and open challenges to guide future work."}

To capture\nfine-grained texture, each motion Gaussian anchors and dynamically activates a\nset of local appearance Gaussians, which are non-rigidly warped to the current\nframe to provide strong initialization and significantly reduce training time.\nThis activation mechanism enables efficient modeling of detailed textures and\nmaintains temporal coherence, allowing high-fidelity rendering even under\nchallenging scenarios such as changing clothes. To enable seamless integration\ninto codec-based volumetric formats, we introduce a global Gaussian Lookup\nTable that records the lifespan of each Gaussian and organizes attributes into\na lifespan-aware 2D layout.

Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable\ncost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding\nwhy developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may\nsupport wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We\nperformed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring\nactivity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying\nmotivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous\nmotivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in\n80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%.

Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only\ncamera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB\nimages from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative\nadversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic\nviews are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality\nAdaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on\nambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,\nsuch as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of\ndownstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and\nsimulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention\nto safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves\nperformance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only\nbaselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights\nthe potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot\noperation in real-world environments."}

We test 13 commercially available\nLMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people\nin stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical\nprofessions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965\nresulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for\nall): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify\noccupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating\nmen in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for\nfemale-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,\ngenerating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The\nextent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male\nrepresentation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%.

To ensure permutation invariance, the\nlosses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing\nGaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some\ncorrespond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous\ncovariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher\ntime complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the\napplication of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward\nalignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and\ntext alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity\nregularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates\nconvergence."}

Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only\ncamera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB\nimages from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative\nadversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic\nviews are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality\nAdaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on\nambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,\nsuch as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of\ndownstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and\nsimulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention\nto safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves\nperformance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only\nbaselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights\nthe potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot\noperation in real-world environments."}

In this work, we propose a novel deep learning\nframework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely\non target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in\ncomplex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and\nbackground discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video\nbackgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable\npriors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and\nsparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the\nbackground, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on\nthese insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires\nminimal assumptions about target characteristics.

This mechanism captures both local\nand non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying\non explicit iterative optimization.

Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and\n25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high\n(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address\nthis issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage\nin order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D\nintracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age\nand the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and\nmultimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection\n(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a\nsubsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse\npatients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:\n0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal\nXSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to\nmodality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the\nmultimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,\ndeeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both\nheart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of\nrelapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we\nstrive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining."}

However, this paradigm is hindered by representation\nmisalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds\nconvey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits\nboth input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy\npre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar\ndistractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features\nwithout explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general\nframework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point\nclouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or\n3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative\nRepresentation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target\nsemantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.\nThis mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances\nresilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within\nLLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation\nDecoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying\nLLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving\ncomprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline.

Targeting vision-related domains,\nthis paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a\ndecoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match\na user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past\nstudies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an\nimage are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose\nfeatures are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a\nguided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a\npre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the\nfeature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.\nOne practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of\ndifferent DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The\nexperimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision\ntransformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features\nremarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into\nthese DNNs' feature spaces."}

In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking\npaths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems."}

We\npropose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key\ncomponents. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and\npose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare\nrefinement.

This letter introduces\nDepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address\nthis problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only\ncamera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB\nimages from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative\nadversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic\nviews are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality\nAdaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on\nambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,\nsuch as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of\ndownstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and\nsimulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention\nto safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves\nperformance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only\nbaselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights\nthe potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot\noperation in real-world environments."}

Such\ndistributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly\nsensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity\nmethods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable\nlimitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance\ndistributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by\nreflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,\nnamed neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered\nmulti-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,\nembedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding\nprocess through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only\nsignificantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection\ndistributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of\nglossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our\nmethod reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,\nallowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently\nproduces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various\nglossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to\nbaseline approaches."}

Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations\n(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked\nSSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range\ndependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic\nself-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable\ntraining under limited compute.
