### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是一种无需微调即可泛化的Transformer模型，显著提升了跨数据集细胞形态分析的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合异构数据集，但批次效应和缺乏通用模型是主要障碍。

Method: CellPainTR是一种基于Transformer的架构，通过源特定的上下文令牌设计，实现了无需微调即可对新数据集的泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上，CellPainTR在批次整合和生物信号保留方面优于ComBat和Harmony；在未见的Bray等数据集上，即使存在显著域和特征变化，仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的CellPainTR模型在跨数据集生物形态学分析中表现出色，为基于图像的生物分析提供了更可靠和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合YOLOv8n和ViT的多模态融合方法，通过整合视觉和音频信息，显著提升了铁路缺陷检测的精度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一模态方法（如YOLO系列检测器）在检测类似正常结构元素的缺陷时存在过度检测问题，需要结合音频信息提升检测精度。

Method: 提出了一种基于领域规则的多模态融合架构，结合YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测和Vision Transformer（ViT）整合多层级特征图（7、16、19层）及合成的音频表示，用于两类缺陷检测：铁路断裂和表面缺陷。

Result: 在真实世界铁路数据集上的实验表明，多模态融合相比纯视觉方法提高了0.2点的精确度和总体准确性，且统计显著性得到验证。

Conclusion: 多模态融合架构通过结合视觉和音频信息，显著提高了铁路缺陷检测的精确度和总体准确性，证明了其相对于单一模态方法的优越性。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过子空间投影和特征重构误差实现高效检测，在多个基准测试中表现领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于特征的后处理方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景中可能不适用，因此需要一种无需训练数据的高效OOD检测方法。

Method: 通过分类器权重的正交分解提取类已知子空间，将原始数据特征映射到该子空间以获得新表示，然后计算子空间内的特征重构误差确定OOD分数。

Result: ClaFR在多个OOD基准测试中表现优异，且无需访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR方法在不需访问训练数据的情况下，在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，为数据隐私保护场景下的OOD检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种适用于小规模数据集的持续预训练策略，简单高效，无需额外超参数或标签，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业领域的数据集通常规模较小，限制了SSL方法的适用性，且预训练模型常缺乏关键信息，DIET-CP旨在填补这一空白。

Method: DIET-CP采用简单的目标函数，无需标签，且不引入额外的超参数，仅需1000张图像即可实现性能提升。

Result: DIET-CP在不同数据模态和骨干网络选择中表现稳定，显著提升了如DINOv3等先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: DIET-CP是一种简单有效的持续预训练策略，能够显著提升模型性能，尤其在数据量有限的专业领域中表现优异。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT通过类感知提示生成器和跨层共享策略，提升了FPT的对抗鲁棒性，实验证明其有效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPT在跨客户端协作微调大规模视觉语言模型时容易受到对抗攻击，导致下游任务分类错误。FedAPT旨在解决非独立同分布设置下的类信息差距问题。

Method: 提出了一种类感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导，生成更全局对齐的视觉提示，并采用跨层生成器共享策略增强模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT显著提升了对抗鲁棒性，大幅优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: FedAPT通过引入类感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，显著提升了FPT在非独立同分布设置下的对抗鲁棒性，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [7] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架通过真实业务任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，评估开源视觉语言模型在企业环境中的表现，填补了学术评估与企业需求之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要依赖多项选择题和合成数据，无法满足企业实际应用需求，如社交媒体内容分析。ViLD旨在填补这一差距，评估VLMs在真实业务场景中的表现。

Method: 引入ViLD框架和创新的BlockWeaver算法，通过构建包含7,500个多样化样本的基准数据集，结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法评估VLMs的性能。

Result: ViLD框架成功评估了领先的开源VLMs（如Qwen、MIMO和InternVL），并提供了针对企业需求的全面任务驱动评估。

Conclusion: ViLD框架通过结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法，为开源视觉语言模型（VLMs）在企业环境中的部署提供了实用的评估和见解，展示了其在复杂业务任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [8] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome通过自监督学习DICOM头部信息，显著提升了医学影像任务的性能和校准性，适用于跨模态和跨厂商场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床成像中，程序选择（如扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在干扰因素阻碍了仅基于图像的网络的跨站点泛化能力。

Method: 1. 协议-图像对比学习；2. 掩码协议预测；3. 协议-协议翻译。

Result: 在三个任务（PE、胶质瘤分级、心胸比检测）中，Protocol Genome相对于基线（SimCLR、MAE）和ImageNet迁移学习，AUROC提高了0.046至0.058，校准性提升了25-37%。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome 通过自监督学习从DICOM头部信息中学习相关性，显著提高了外部验证的AUROC和ECE，同时增强了校准性和跨模态、跨厂商的鲁棒性。该方法在临床成像中减少了假阳性，并适用于PACS系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在字符分割和组合任务上表现不佳，揭示了其结构性限制，并提出了未来改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高级视觉语言模型是否具备人类在识别字符时的韧性，尤其是在字符被分割、融合或部分遮挡的情况下。

Method: 通过构建两个受心理物理学启发的基准测试，分别针对中文象形文字和英文字母单词，通过拼接、重组和叠加字形来生成对模型'可见但不可读'的刺激，但对人类仍可辨识。

Result: 尽管在干净文本上表现强劲，当代VLM在这些扰动下表现严重下降，常产生无关或不连贯的输出。这表明模型过度依赖通用视觉不变性，而忽视了组合先验的重要性。

Conclusion: 当代视觉语言模型（VLM）在处理字符分割、组合和绑定时存在结构性限制，这限制了它们在教育、无障碍访问、文化遗产和安全等领域的实际应用。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种频率域特征级学习方法，结合时间融合策略，有效解决了动态心脏MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态心脏MRI成像的复杂性和动态性导致高质量且多样化的k空间数据稀缺，限制了MRI重建的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，在频率域进行特征级建模，并结合多种时间融合策略优化生成轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低数据量情况下仍具备强大的生成能力，有望缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种在频率域进行特征级学习的方法，结合时间融合策略合成k空间数据，有效解决了动态心脏MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了模型在语义和感知差异较大的类别间泛化属性知识的能力，发现性能随相关性降低而下降，聚类方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型能否在语义和感知差异较大的类别间泛化属性知识，例如识别‘四条腿’这一属性在‘狗’和‘椅子’中的共同性。

Method: 引入了四种训练-测试分割策略：基于LLM的语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、基于嵌入的聚类以及使用真实标签的超类别分割。

Result: 随着训练和测试类别相关性的降低，模型性能急剧下降。聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性同时保持可学习性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 当前模型在属性预测任务中表现出对训练和测试集相关性的强烈敏感性，尤其是在语义和感知差异较大的类别间。通过不同的分割策略，研究发现基于聚类的方法在减少隐藏相关性同时保持可学习性方面最为有效。

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种人机交互框架，用于定量评估LLM生成的3D模型，并通过案例研究展示了代码级提示在提高生成保真度方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽能解释多模态输入生成复杂3D形状，但评估其几何和结构保真度的稳健方法仍不完善。

Method: 提出了一套全面的相似性和复杂性指标，包括体积精度、表面对齐、尺寸保真度和拓扑复杂性，用于将生成模型与真实CAD参考进行基准测试。

Result: 研究发现，随着语义丰富度的增加，生成保真度有所提升，代码级提示在所有指标上实现了完美重建。

Conclusion: 本文不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还为验证和优化CAD应用中的生成模型提供了可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

*Jiarui Chen,Yikeng Chen,Yingshuang Zou,Ye Huang,Peng Wang,Yuan Liu,Yujing Sun,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS$^{2}$通过联合优化原始数量和参数，显著降低3DGS内存消耗，适用于边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）作为主流新视图合成技术，其高内存消耗限制了在边缘设备上的应用。现有压缩方法大多仅关注存储压缩，未解决渲染内存的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种统一软剪枝框架，将原始数量和球面高斯瓣数量剪枝建模为单一约束优化问题，并使用轻量级任意方向球面高斯瓣替代内存密集型球面谐波作为颜色表示。

Result: 实验表明，MEGS$^{2}$相比现有方法实现了50%的静态VRAM减少和40%的渲染VRAM减少，同时保持可比的渲染质量。

Conclusion: MEGS$^{2}$通过联合优化原始数量和各原始参数，实现了前所未有的内存压缩，显著降低了静态和渲染VRAM需求，同时保持可比的渲染质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化损失函数，通过强制样本符合标准高斯分布特性，优化了文本到图像模型的潜在空间性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在文本到图像模型的潜在空间中实现更高效的优化，并防止奖励黑客行为，需要一种能够强制样本符合标准高斯分布特性的正则化方法。

Method: 提出了一种复合损失函数，结合了空间域中的矩正则化和谱域中的功率谱正则化，确保样本符合标准高斯分布的特性。

Result: 实验表明，该正则化方法在生成建模中优于现有方法，有效防止了奖励黑客行为并加速了收敛。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的正则化损失函数，通过强制样本符合标准高斯分布的特性，有效提升了文本到图像模型在潜在空间中的优化性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究引入了一个评估AI生成图像中社会偏见的基准，发现大型多模态模型不仅复制还放大了职业性别刻板印象，且不同模型的偏见程度差异显著，强调了标准化评估工具的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在文本到图像生成方面取得了革命性进展，但它们可能会延续训练数据中的有害社会偏见。先前的研究已发现这些模型中的性别偏见，但方法上的局限性阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。

Method: 研究引入了Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation基准，测试了13种商业可用的LMMs，使用75个程序生成的性别中立提示，生成刻板印象中男性、女性和非刻板印象职业的人物图像，并通过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 结果显示：1) LMMs不仅复制而且放大了职业性别刻板印象，男性在男性刻板印象职业中占93.0%，而在女性刻板印象职业中仅占22.5%；2) 模型表现出强烈的默认男性偏见，在非刻板印象职业中生成男性的比例为68.3%；3) 不同模型的偏见程度差异显著，整体男性代表性从46.7%到73.3%不等。表现最佳的模型减少了性别刻板印象并接近性别平等，获得了最高的公平性分数。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调了标准化、自动化评估工具在促进AI开发中的责任和公平性的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于块稀疏核的注意力操作替代方案，显著加速了多视图重建模型的推理速度，无需重新训练主干网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到现有基于Transformer的模型（如VGGT和$\pi^3$）由于全局注意力层的二次复杂度而面临运行时瓶颈，限制了其在大规模图像集上的扩展性。

Method: 提出了一种基于高度优化的块稀疏核的注意力操作替代方案，适用于VGGT和$\pi^3$模型，支持大规模图像集合。

Result: 在全面的多视图基准测试中证明了方法的有效性，实现了高达4倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: 通过替换密集全局注意力操作为基于高度优化的块稀疏核，我们的方法在保持任务性能的同时，实现了高达4倍的推理加速，且无需重新训练主干网络。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文研究VIO系统在边缘服务器上的潜在威胁，提出无监督检测与恢复机制，实验证明其有效减少误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势可能导致服务器端威胁，其中细微的姿态欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时逃避启发式检查。

Method: 通过攻击无关的训练会话来学习运动的时序规律，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复以保持姿态一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试平台上，实验结果表明，相比无防御基线，该方法在轨迹和姿态误差方面有显著减少。

Conclusion: 本文提出的无监督、无标签检测与恢复机制显著减少了轨迹和姿态误差，验证了其在抵御VIO系统潜在威胁中的有效性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Motivation: 人脸增强技术虽能提升感知质量，但可能降低深度伪造检测器的准确性，本研究旨在探讨这些技术是否可作为反取证工具。

Method: 本研究系统地评估了传统图像处理方法和先进的基于GAN的增强方法对深度伪造检测器的影响，并进行了对抗训练实验以评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，即使是基本的增强滤镜也能显著降低检测准确率（ASR高达64.63%），而基于GAN的技术进一步利用这些漏洞（ASR高达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 人脸增强技术可以有效作为反取证工具，强调了需要开发更具韧性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Motivation: 在开放世界场景中，已有标签数据无法覆盖未来可能出现的新类别，因此需要无监督方法来发现新类别。

Method: 利用Vision Transformers生成向量嵌入，并通过流形学习技术优化这些嵌入，以提升图像聚类性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上，无论聚类数量是否已知，均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种完全无监督的方法，用于确定数据集中新类别，通过结合Vision Transformers和流形学习技术，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的聚类和新类发现性能。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet通过结合全局语义与局部精度的双分支设计，显著提升了乳腺超声分割的准确性，尤其对小、低对比度病变效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的乳腺超声分割对可靠测量、定量分析和下游分类至关重要，但对于小或低对比度病变仍具挑战性。文本提示可增加临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位的文本-图像线索易产生粗糙、模糊的边界。

Method: 提出了XBusNet，一种新颖的双提示、双分支多模态模型，结合图像特征与临床文本。全局路径基于CLIP Vision Transformer编码整图语义，局部U-Net路径强调精确边界，并通过描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语的提示进行调制。提示自动从结构化元数据组装，无需手动点击。

Result: XBusNet在BLU数据集上实现了最先进的性能，平均Dice为0.8765，IoU为0.8149，优于六个强基线。小病变的提升最大，漏检和虚假激活减少。消融研究显示全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的互补作用。

Conclusion: 双提示、双分支的多模态设计通过结合全局语义与局部精度，实现了精确的乳腺超声分割，尤其提升了小、低对比度病变的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Motivation: 数据稀缺限制了医学影像深度学习的应用，需要一种有效的数据增强方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散概率模型（DPM）的数据增强框架，用于乳腺热图分类。该框架结合了预训练ResNet-50的深度特征和从U-Net分割肿瘤中提取的手工非线性特征（如分形维度），并训练XGBoost分类器。

Result: 使用DPM增强和非线性特征融合的框架在乳腺热图分类中达到了98.0%的准确率和98.1%的灵敏度。消融研究和统计测试证实了这两者的关键作用。

Conclusion: 本研究验证了先进生成模型与可解释特征之间的协同作用，为创建高精度的医学诊断工具提供了支持。

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

TL;DR: RecA是一种高效的后训练方法，通过视觉理解嵌入作为密集提示，显著提升多模态模型的生成和编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练依赖的图像-文本对通常描述稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，限制了UMMs的性能。

Method: 通过重构对齐（RecA）方法，利用视觉理解编码器的嵌入作为密集的“文本提示”，并通过自监督的重构损失优化模型以重构输入图像。

Result: RecA在仅使用27 GPU小时的情况下，显著提升了图像生成（GenEval 0.73→0.90，DPGBench 80.93→88.15）和编辑（ImgEdit 3.38→3.75，GEdit 6.94→7.25）的性能，超越了更大的开源模型。

Conclusion: RecA作为一种高效且通用的后训练对齐策略，显著提升了统一多模态模型（UMMs）在生成和编辑任务中的表现，且适用于多种UMM架构。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Method: 提出了DEPF方法，包含双域增强模块（DDE）和优先级引导的Mamba融合模块（PGMF），分别用于增强低光图像和优化目标建模。

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上，DEPF在目标检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DEPF在无人机多光谱目标检测中表现出色，优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Motivation: 尽管图卷积网络（GCNs）在骨架动作识别中表现出色，但在区分模糊动作时存在局限性，需要改进拓扑和空间特征的表示。

Method: 提出了一种名为G$^{3}$CN的新方法，结合高斯滤波器精炼骨架拓扑图，并集成门控循环单元（GRU）以增强骨架点间的信息传播。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA等基准数据集上的实验表明，G$^{3}$CN显著提升了模糊动作的识别效果。

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN通过高斯拓扑精炼和门控机制，有效提升了骨架动作识别中模糊动作的区分能力，并在多个基准数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有方法多关注单模态建模，忽视了多模态融合的潜力；语言提供的空间关系先验能增强遮挡场景的响应，但全局特征融合会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐失败。

Method: 提出了基于解析图的视觉-语言交互模型（PGVL），包含引导模块（GM）实现高低层节点的特征更新，采用自上而下分解与自下而上组合的两阶段方法，结合递归双向交叉注意力。

Conclusion: PGVL通过新颖的引导模块（GM）有效融合视觉与语言模态，显著提升了遮挡场景下的姿态估计性能，并在多个主流数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Result: LGAA在定量和定性实验中表现出色，支持文本和图像条件，且仅需69k多视角实例即可高效收敛。

Conclusion: LGAA框架通过模块化设计和知识保留方案，实现了高效的端到端PBR-ready 3D资产生成，并在少量多视角数据上表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了EgoGazeVQA基准，利用视线信息改进MLLMs在自我中心视频中的意图理解，实验证明视线引导方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了视线作为用户意图指示器的关键作用，因此引入视线引导的视频问答基准以填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准，利用视线信息生成问答对，并通过空间、时间和意图相关线索的整合来改进模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，现有MLLMs难以准确理解用户意图，而视线引导的提示方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果强调了视线信息在提升自我中心场景下AI助手的个性化和有效性方面的重要价值。

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CVGL方法通常局限于单一视角或模态，且直接视觉匹配策略缺乏可解释性，仅预测两张图像是否对应，而不解释匹配背后的原理。

Method: 通过优化的实现提升训练效率，采用两阶段训练策略实现与先前模态特定CVGL模型相当的准确性。利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力，提出新任务GLEAM-X，结合跨视角对应预测与可解释推理。

Conclusion: GLEAM-C和GLEAM-X共同构成了一个全面的CVGL流程，整合了多模态、多视角对齐与可解释的对应分析，统一了准确的跨视角匹配与可解释的推理，推动了地理定位技术的发展。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合，解决了OCTA图像获取和血管细节重建的难题，提升了诊断可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量OCTA图像获取困难，现有深度学习方法忽视视网膜层间血管差异且难以重建复杂血管细节，限制了诊断可靠性。

Method: 提出XOCT框架，结合跨维度监督（CDS）和多尺度特征融合（MSFF）网络，利用2D层间投影作为监督信号，并通过多尺度特征提取和通道重加权策略增强血管细节。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上的实验表明，XOCT显著提升了en-face投影的质量，增强了OCTA的可访问性和诊断价值。

Conclusion: XOCT框架通过整合跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合网络，显著提升了OCTA图像的质量和诊断价值，特别是在视网膜层感知血管重建方面。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Abstract: Forests function as crucial carbon reservoirs on land, and their carbon sinks
can efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate
change. Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon
stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote

However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and
Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in
China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练数据中依赖虚假相关性，导致在安全关键领域（如医学和自动驾驶）中出现有偏见或不公平的预测。

Method: 基于隐私保护的遗忘技术，评估了梯度上升、LoRA和教师-学生蒸馏等策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（CUB-200-2011、CIFAR-10和CelebA）上，后处理遗忘显著减少了子组差异，分别提高了94.86%、30.28%和97.37%的公平性。

Conclusion: 机器学习遗忘技术作为一种后处理方法，可以有效减少视觉模型中的偏见，提高公平性，且无需完全重新训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合隐式神经表示和文本到视频扩散模型，成功实现了矢量图形的自动化动画生成，显著提升了动画质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural

Motivation: 3DGS在渲染方面表现优异，但由于其非结构化表示和缺乏显式几何监督，准确且完整的表面重建仍具挑战性。

Method: DiGS框架将可学习的SDF值与每个高斯分布关联，设计了基于几何指导的网格增长策略，以多尺度层次自适应分布高斯。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS一致性地提升了重建准确性和完整性。

Conclusion: DiGS通过将SDF学习嵌入3DGS流程，显著提升了3D场景的重建准确性和完整性，同时保持了高渲染保真度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种通过局部混合和逻辑优化来增强对抗样本可转移性的新框架，有效解决了现有方法破坏全局语义特征和梯度消失的问题。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Conclusion: MVAT框架通过利用时序多视图数据和教师-学生蒸馏范式，显著提升了弱监督3D目标检测的性能，接近全监督方法的水平，且无需3D标注。

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a

TL;DR: UFC是一种通用少样本控制适配器，能高效适应新空间控制任务，显著降低训练成本并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制适配器对新空间控制条件的适应能力有限且训练成本高，需改进以支持更广泛的任务。

Method: 提出UFC适配器，利用查询与支持条件之间的类比构建任务特定控制特征，包括匹配机制和少量任务特定参数的更新。

Result: 在六个新空间控制任务上，仅用30个标注样本微调即可实现精细控制，且仅需0.1%全训练数据即可达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: UFC（通用少样本控制适配器）通过少量样本微调即可在新颖的空间控制任务上实现精细控制，且性能与完全监督基线相当。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于HU的前景掩码策略，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能，实验证明其在多个数据集上均有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MIM在3D医学图像计算中因随机掩码忽略了解剖对象的密度而受限，需要一种更有效的掩码策略。

Method: 提出了一种简单而有效的HU-based Foreground Masking策略，利用HU测量值来关注内脏器官的强度分布，排除空气和液体等非组织区域。

Result: 在五个公开的3D医学影像数据集上（BTCV、Flare22、MM-WHS、Amos22、BraTS）的实验表明，该掩码策略在分割质量和Dice分数上均有所提升（BTCV:~84.64%、Flare22:~92.43%、MM-WHS:~90.67%、Amos22:~88.64%、BraTS:~78.55%）。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入基于Hounsfield Unit（HU）的前景掩码策略，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能，强调了领域特定掩码图像建模（MIM）的重要性，并为医学图像表示学习提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Conclusion: TextlessRAG 是一个端到端的框架，用于基于语音的文档图像问答，无需 ASR、TTS 和 OCR，直接处理语音、检索视觉知识并生成答案，显著提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有方法依赖耗时的GAN反转和测试时优化的问题，以及缺乏大规模3D头部资产的问题。

Method: 提出了一种从粗糙到精细的高斯头部生成流程，结合了FLAME模型的稀疏点与图像特征，通过transformer块进行特征提取和粗糙形状重建，随后进行细化以实现高保真重建。此外，还引入了一个双分支框架，有效聚合了结构化球形三平面特征和非结构化点基特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在重建效率和保真度上优于现有工作。

Conclusion: 该框架通过前馈方式实现了从单张无姿势图像快速合成高斯全头模型，显著提升了重建和渲染效率。

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

TL;DR: CGAT架构通过图注意力机制和可视化解释，提升了3D形状识别任务的可信度和性能，适用于高风险应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学和法医学等领域的识别任务中具有潜力，但其黑盒特性阻碍了在高风险应用中的采用，因为这些应用需要信任和可解释性。针对3D形状识别任务，本文旨在解决这一需求。

Method: 本文提出了Class Node Graph Attention Network（CGAT）架构，利用图注意力卷积和固有的注意力机制（通过注意力展开可视化）来解释其决策过程。评估了局部平均曲率和到质心节点的距离作为节点特征（单独及组合使用）以及模型深度的影响。

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和到质心距离作为节点特征，模型性能略有提升（加权F1得分为0.76），并生成了更全面的注意力可视化。包含指向全局CLS节点的有向边的模型产生了更直观的注意力图，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强了信任并促进了专家对模型决策的验证。尽管在牙科数据上进行了演示，但CGAT广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务，推动了透明且具有竞争力的深度学习模型在高风险环境中的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前性别偏见评估方法受非性别特征干扰严重，建议结合特征敏感性测量以提高评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究性别偏见评估中非性别特征（如物体和背景）的干扰问题，以确定当前评估方法是否真实反映了性别偏见。

Method: 通过系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP和PHASE）中的非性别特征，并量化这些扰动对偏见评估的影响。

Result: 研究发现，即使是对非性别特征的最小扰动（如遮挡10%的物体或轻微模糊背景），也会显著改变偏见得分，生成型VLMs的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体的变化达43%。

Conclusion: 当前的性别偏见评估方法由于存在非性别特征的干扰，导致评估结果不可靠。建议在报告偏见指标时同时提供特征敏感性测量，以提高评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VLM模型未充分利用患者元数据和临床诊断知识，且在3D医学影像上效果有限。

Method: 通过将结构化元数据转换为合成报告以丰富文本输入，并添加辅助标记预测MMSE分数，结合轻量级提示调整技术。

Result: 在两个AD数据集上达到最先进性能，优于需10000张图像微调的现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的数据高效微调管道在3D MRI上表现出色，尤其在阿尔茨海默病诊断中，仅需1500张训练图像即可超越现有方法。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Result: 在ADNI数据集上表现出优越的分类准确性和可解释性，同时在OASIS和PPMI数据集上展示了零样本和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 论文提出的自监督交叉编码器框架在神经退行性疾病的MRI诊断中表现出色，不仅提高了分类准确性和可解释性，还展示了强大的零样本和跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 提出的SFW框架在平衡鲁棒性和图像保真度方面表现出色，有效解决了语义水印中的固有权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Result: EDFFDNet减少了70.5%的参数、32.6%的内存和33.7%的总运行时间，PSNR提升了0.5 dB；EDFFDNet-2进一步提升了1.06 dB PSNR。

Conclusion: EDFFDNet通过引入指数衰减基函数的自由形变网络和自适应稀疏运动聚合器，显著提升了深度差异场景下的图像配准效率与准确性，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Conclusion: 该论文的结论强调了明确解决类间特征接近问题对于增强深度神经网络（DNN）对抗鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Conclusion: 结合代理和批评家的方法在复杂视频推理任务上表现出色，验证了利用现有感知能力进行更复杂推理的可行性。

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC利用语义分割指导多熵模型选择，针对不同语义区域优化概率分布估计，显著提升无损图像压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单熵模型方法无法充分捕捉图像不同语义区域的多样统计特性，限制了压缩性能。

Method: SEEC首先提取图像特征，然后应用语义分割识别不同区域，并为每个区域分配专门的熵模型，最后使用多通道离散逻辑混合似然有效建模像素值分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，SEEC在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩率，同时仅引入最小的编码和解码延迟。

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过结合语义分割和多熵模型，显著提升了无损图像压缩的性能，支持ROI编码，并在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩率。

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

TL;DR: 通过多模态深度学习模型，结合视觉和表格数据，有效预测中风复发风险，并发现心脏疾病与颈动脉的关联，为治疗提供新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风是全球第二大死因，复发率在首年高达5-25%，且复发死亡率高达40%，因此早期识别高风险患者并制定治疗计划至关重要。

Method: 收集了2010至2024年间的3D颅内CTA影像数据、心脏疾病记录、年龄和性别信息，训练了单模态和多模态深度学习模型，分别用于二元复发检测（Task 1）和复发自由生存时间预测（Task 2）。

Result: Task 1的表格数据AUC为0.84；Task 2的多模态模型（视觉:表格=0.68:0.32）的c-index为0.68，AUC为0.71。深度分析揭示了心脏疾病与颈动脉的关联。

Conclusion: 通过多模态深度学习模型（XSRD-net）结合视觉和表格数据，成功识别了中风复发风险患者，并揭示了心脏疾病与颈动脉之间的关联，为未来治疗计划提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多阶段流程实现了从多视角图像中重建头发几何结构，并通过新颖的合并方案和评估指标提升了拓扑准确性，适用于多种发型，且效率高。

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss在合成和室内场景中实现了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本阻碍了在真实世界场景中的实时渲染。

Method: 在RayGauss基础上，引入体积渲染加速策略（如空跳、自适应采样）、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化以减少误检交点，并提出新的致密化准则。

Result: RayGaussX在真实世界数据集上实现了5倍至12倍的训练加速和50倍至80倍的渲染速度提升，同时PSNR视觉质量提升高达+0.56 dB。

Conclusion: RayGaussX通过引入空跳、自适应采样等加速策略，显著提升了训练和推理速度，同时在更大场景中提高了图形质量。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学领域，高分辨率图像获取具有挑战性，需要在扫描时间、患者舒适度和图像质量之间取得平衡。现有方法通常由放射科医生单独分析低分辨率扫描，耗时且可能导致不准确解释。

Method: 提出了一种多视角神经网络，以自监督方式训练，无需对应的高分辨率数据，并引入了稀疏坐标基损失以优化模型。

Result: 在两个独立队列的MR图像上评估，结果显示与最先进的自监督超分辨率方法相比，具有可比或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合患者无关的离线和患者特定的在线阶段，实现了患者特定重建速度的显著提升（高达十倍），同时保持或提升了超分辨率质量。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种新型深度引导的3D高斯溅射场景修复方法，通过联合深度和对象监督以及一致性感知细化，实现了更高的视觉质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在多视图图像中创建高度真实的3D场景表示方面表现出色，但修复缺失区域（无论是由于遮挡还是场景编辑）仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务，常常导致模糊细节、伪影和不一致的几何形状。

Method: 结合深度基础和对象基础的联合监督，确保修复的高斯在3D空间中准确放置并与周围几何对齐；提出一致性感知细化方案，选择性地识别和修正不一致区域。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill不仅在视觉保真度上超越了现有的基于NeRF和3DGS的修复方法，还将训练时间减少了24.5%。定性结果表明，该方法在具有挑战性的视角下提供了更清晰的细节、更少的伪影和更大的连贯性。

Conclusion: SplatFill在3D高斯溅射场景修复中实现了最先进的感知质量和效率提升，通过深度引导和一致性感知细化方案，显著提高了修复区域的视觉保真度和几何一致性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)，结合Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)和Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)，无需大规模预对齐即可桥接LLMs与3D点云的表示差异。

Result: PLM在ScanNetv2和Multi3DRefer上分别实现了+7.3 mIoU和+6.0 mIoU的提升，并在4个任务的7个基准测试中表现一致优异。

Conclusion: PLM框架通过OcDR和GRD有效解决了LLMs与3D点云之间的表示对齐问题，显著提升了分割性能，并在多个基准测试中展现了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: D-LEAF方法通过动态定位和纠正错误，显著减少了多模态大语言模型中的幻觉现象，同时在标准基准测试中提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Motivation: 揭示在消费级硬件（如RTX 4060笔记本电脑）上，目标检测器的性能并非受计算限制，而是由系统级瓶颈主导，需开发硬件感知的推理策略。

Method: 引入了一种模型无关的两阶段自适应推理算法（Two-Pass Adaptive Inference），通过快速低分辨率检测和仅在检测置信度低时升级至高分辨率模型，优化系统级瓶颈。

Result: 在5000张COCO数据集图像上，相比PyTorch Early-Exit基线方法，实现了1.85倍加速，mAP仅损失5.51%。

Conclusion: 本研究通过提出一种两阶段自适应推理算法，为在资源受限的消费级硬件上部署高性能实时AI提供了实用且可复制的解决方案，强调了从纯模型优化转向硬件感知推理策略的重要性。

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开源方法推理模式单调、交互轮次有限的问题，以应对需要试错探索的复杂任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe Dataset、开发迭代数据收集管道、提出over-turn masking策略。

Result: Mini-o3在推理时能自然扩展到数十轮，且准确率随轮次增加而提升，成功解决了复杂视觉搜索问题。

Conclusion: Mini-o3通过扩展工具交互、引入深度多轮推理和创新的训练策略，在复杂视觉搜索任务中实现了最先进的性能，并能自然扩展到数十轮推理。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

TL;DR: ScoreHOI是一种基于扩散的优化器，通过引入扩散先验和物理约束，显著提升了人-物交互重建的精确性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类与其周围环境之间的复杂相互关系是重要里程碑，但现有优化方法因缺乏人-物交互的先验知识而难以实现物理上合理的结果。

Method: ScoreHOI是一种基于扩散的优化器，利用分数引导采样的可控性，通过特定物理约束引导去噪过程，并提出接触驱动的迭代细化方法来增强接触合理性和重建准确性。

Result: ScoreHOI通过扩散先验和物理约束有效改善了重建结果，接触驱动的迭代细化进一步提升了接触合理性和重建精度。

Conclusion: ScoreHOI在标准基准测试中表现出色，优于现有最先进方法，展示了其在联合人-物交互重建中实现精确和稳健改进的能力。

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Motivation: 为了在在轨服务（OOS）和主动碎片清除（ADR）任务中准确评估非合作空间目标的几何和运动特性，需要解决翻滚目标重建的挑战。

Method: 研究通过Isaac Sim开发了一个模拟环境，生成在真实轨道光照条件下翻滚卫星的2D图像序列，并使用Neuralangelo等先进算法进行3D重建。

Result: 初步结果显示，Neuralangelo在静态场景中能够生成与原始CAD模型高度匹配的3D网格，误差和伪影极少，能够捕获任务规划所需的关键细节。

Conclusion: 该研究为动态场景中的非合作空间目标3D重建提供了初步基准，展示了Neuralangelo在静态场景中的高质量重建能力，为后续动态场景评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 针对DNN内部特征提取过程的黑盒性质，论文旨在通过生成与指定特征匹配的图像，揭示图像中哪些属性被编码到DNN的特征中。

Method: 解码器采用引导扩散模型，通过最小化清洁图像特征与用户指定特征之间的欧几里得距离，反向生成图像。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的解码器能够有效分析DNN的特征空间，通过生成与用户指定特征高度匹配的图像，揭示了DNN内部特征编码的机制，为理解黑盒模型提供了新视角。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

TL;DR: Visual-TableQA是一个大规模、开放领域的多模态数据集，通过多LLM协作生成复杂表格和QA对，显著提升了视觉语言模型的表格推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在表格数据上的推理能力有限，现有数据集规模、多样性和推理深度不足，尤其是渲染表格图像方面。

Method: 采用多推理LLM协作的模块化生成流程，包括生成、验证和灵感三个角色，通过跨模型提示和LLM陪审团过滤确保数据多样性和质量。

Result: 构建了包含2.5k复杂LaTeX渲染表格和6k推理密集型QA对的Visual-TableQA数据集，模型微调后在外部分基准测试中表现优于多个专有模型。

Conclusion: Visual-TableQA数据集通过模块化、可扩展的生成流程，显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂表格数据上的推理能力，并在外部基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决单参考图像中任意未见物体的6D姿态估计问题，克服3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度以及生成模型与真实图像之间的域差距等挑战。

Method: 提出了一个包含粗到细对齐模块和文本引导生成域随机化策略的流程，前者通过多视角特征匹配与渲染比较细化结合来优化尺度和姿态，后者通过多样化纹理实现合成数据的有效微调。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light和LM-O等挑战性基准上，OnePoseViaGen实现了远超先前方法的最先进性能，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取。

Conclusion: OnePoseViaGen通过粗到细的对齐模块和文本引导的生成域随机化策略，实现了高保真的单视图3D生成，支持可靠的一次性6D姿态估计，并在实际机器人操作中验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种简单有效的正则化策略，通过对齐MLLMs与预训练视觉基础模型的内部视觉表示，显著提升模型在视觉中心任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉中心任务（如对象计数或空间推理）中表现受限，主要由于文本监督范式仅提供对视觉通路的间接指导，导致训练中丢失细粒度视觉细节。

Method: 提出VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL)策略，通过正则化方法对齐MLLMs与预训练视觉基础模型的内部视觉表示。

Result: 实验表明，VIRAL在广泛采用的多模态基准测试中所有任务上均取得一致改进，并通过消融研究验证了框架的关键设计选择。

Conclusion: VIRAL通过显式对齐MLLMs与预训练视觉基础模型的内部视觉表示，有效提升了模型在复杂视觉输入上的推理能力，为MLLMs中视觉信息的有效整合开辟了重要方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代Web应用面临的安全挑战（如未经授权的访问、数据泄露和注入攻击）严重影响了信任和可靠性。传统OOP常将安全逻辑与业务功能交织，导致代码纠缠、分散和可维护性降低。本研究探讨AOP如何通过模块化横切关注点来提升安全软件开发。

Method: 本研究采用案例研究方法，比较了基于AOP的安全特性实现（如认证、授权、输入验证、加密、日志记录和会话管理）与传统OOP或中间件方法的差异。通过分析代码质量指标、性能指标和可维护性指标，并结合开发者反馈，使用ISO/IEC 25010软件质量模型指导的统计方法评估实现差异。

Result: 研究发现，AOP在安全机制方面显著提升了模块化、可重用性和可维护性，同时仅带来轻微的性能开销。

Conclusion: 研究表明，AOP（面向切面编程）能够有效提升安全机制的模块化、可重用性和可维护性，同时仅引入最小的性能开销。这为软件工程师和研究人员在Web应用开发中平衡安全性与软件质量提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Security remains a critical challenge in modern web applications, where
threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks
continue to undermine trust and reliability. Traditional Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality,
leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study
investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure
software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a
case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features
including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging,
and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches.
Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code,
coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics
(response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators.
Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging
experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality
model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings
demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of
security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The
study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers
seeking to balance security with software quality in web application
development.

Motivation: 工业4.0中IT与OT的融合暴露了传统分层架构（如ISA-95和RAMI 4.0）的局限性，如刚性、数据孤岛和缺乏云原生技术支持，阻碍了可扩展和互操作工业系统的发展。

Method: 通过理论比较分析（与现有标准、操作模型和学术提案）和基于性能数据的定量评估（来自已发布的真实智能制造实施案例）来验证CRACI架构。

Result: CRACI 通过解耦和事件驱动模型支持灵活的非分层数据流，并通过嵌入信任、治理与策略、可观测性和生命周期管理等核心支柱确保设计质量，验证结果表明其优于传统架构。

Conclusion: CRACI 提出了一种可行的、先进的计算连续体架构，克服了传统模型的局限性，支持可扩展的现代工业系统。

Abstract: The convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology
(OT) in Industry 4.0 exposes the limitations of traditional, hierarchical
architectures like ISA-95 and RAMI 4.0. Their inherent rigidity, data silos,
and lack of support for cloud-native technologies impair the development of
scalable and interoperable industrial systems. This paper addresses this issue
by introducing CRACI, a Cloud-native Reference Architecture for the Industrial
Compute Continuum. Among other features, CRACI promotes a decoupled and
event-driven model to enable flexible, non-hierarchical data flows across the
continuum. It embeds cross-cutting concerns as foundational pillars: Trust,
Governance & Policy, Observability, and Lifecycle Management, ensuring quality
attributes are core to the design. The proposed architecture is validated
through a two-fold approach: (1) a comparative theoretical analysis against
established standards, operational models, and academic proposals; and (2) a
quantitative evaluation based on performance data from previously published
real-world smart manufacturing implementations. The results demonstrate that
CRACI provides a viable, state-of-the-art architecture that utilizes the
compute continuum to overcome the structural limitations of legacy models and
enable scalable, modern industrial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NVD缺乏与VFCs的明确链接，现有方法依赖稀疏且噪音多的提交消息，无法捕捉漏洞描述的深层语义。

Method: 引入PatchSeeker方法，利用大型语言模型生成嵌入和增强提交消息，作为自然语言报告与代码变更之间的语义桥梁。

Result: PatchSeeker在基准数据集上比最佳基线Prospector的MRR提高59.3%，Recall@10提高27.9%，扩展评估进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PatchSeeker通过利用大型语言模型在漏洞描述与VFCs之间建立语义链接，显著提升了映射性能，但仍有局限性和未来改进空间。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose serious risks to modern software ecosystems.
While the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the authoritative source for
cataloging these vulnerabilities, it often lacks explicit links to the
corresponding Vulnerability-Fixing Commits (VFCs). VFCs encode precise code
changes, enabling vulnerability localization, patch analysis, and dataset
construction. Automatically mapping NVD records to their true VFCs is therefore
critical. Existing approaches have limitations as they rely on sparse, often
noisy commit messages and fail to capture the deep semantics in the
vulnerability descriptions. To address this gap, we introduce PatchSeeker, a
novel method that leverages large language models to create rich semantic links
between vulnerability descriptions and their VFCs. PatchSeeker generates
embeddings from NVD descriptions and enhances commit messages by synthesizing
detailed summaries for those that are short or uninformative. These generated
messages act as a semantic bridge, effectively closing the information gap
between natural language reports and low-level code changes. Our approach
PatchSeeker achieves 59.3% higher MRR and 27.9% higher Recall@10 than the
best-performing baseline, Prospector, on the benchmark dataset. The extended
evaluation on recent CVEs further confirms PatchSeeker's effectiveness.
Ablation study shows that both the commit message generation method and the
selection of backbone LLMs make a positive contribution to PatchSeeker. We also
discuss limitations and open challenges to guide future work.

TL;DR: 拼接技术扩展Spack，实现源代码和二进制分发的无缝混合，提升安装速度并保持灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二进制包管理器安装速度快但配置灵活性低，而源代码包管理器灵活性高但编译速度慢。Spack作为HPC领域的包管理器，缺乏二进制兼容性模型，无法混合未一起构建的二进制文件。

Method: 通过增强Spack的打包语言和依赖解析引擎，实现了对兼容二进制文件的复用。

Result: 拼接技术允许快速从二进制文件安装，即使是ABI敏感的依赖项（如MPI），也无需大量重新构建。

Conclusion: 本文提出的拼接技术扩展了Spack的功能，使其能够无缝混合源代码和二进制分发，同时保持源代码构建的灵活性，并最小化安装时间的开销。

Abstract: Binary package managers install software quickly but they limit
configurability due to rigid ABI requirements that ensure compatibility between
binaries. Source package managers provide flexibility in building software, but
compilation can be slow. For example, installing an HPC code with a new MPI
implementation may result in a full rebuild. Spack, a widely deployed,
HPC-focused package manager, can use source and pre-compiled binaries, but
lacks a binary compatibility model, so it cannot mix binaries not built
together. We present splicing, an extension to Spack that models binary
compatibility between packages and allows seamless mixing of source and binary
distributions. Splicing augments Spack's packaging language and dependency
resolution engine to reuse compatible binaries but maintains the flexibility of
source builds. It incurs minimal installation-time overhead and allows rapid
installation from binaries, even for ABI-sensitive dependencies like MPI that
would otherwise require many rebuilds.

Motivation: 现有的业务过程模拟方法主要支持战术决策，从空状态开始模拟以估计长期效果。然而，对于操作决策，需要基于当前案例和资源状态的短期性能预测，现有方法无法满足这一需求。

Method: 研究了一种替代方法，该方法从正在进行的案例的事件日志中派生的当前状态表示初始化模拟。解决了两个挑战：确定模拟运行所需的当前状态信息，以及如何从事件日志中派生过程的当前状态。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法比传统的预热期长期模拟在短期性能预测上更准确，特别是在概念漂移或突发性能模式的情况下。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种从事件日志中初始化模拟的方法，用于业务过程的短期性能预测，实验证明该方法比传统的预热期长期模拟更准确，特别是在概念漂移或突发性能模式的情况下。

Abstract: Business process simulation is an approach to evaluate business process
changes prior to implementation. Existing methods in this field primarily
support tactical decision-making, where simulations start from an empty state
and aim to estimate the long-term effects of process changes. A complementary
use-case is operational decision-making, where the goal is to forecast
short-term performance based on ongoing cases and to analyze the impact of
temporary disruptions, such as demand spikes and shortfalls in available
resources. An approach to tackle this use-case is to run a long-term simulation
up to a point where the workload is similar to the current one (warm-up), and
measure performance thereon. However, this approach does not consider the
current state of ongoing cases and resources in the process. This paper studies
an alternative approach that initializes the simulation from a representation
of the current state derived from an event log of ongoing cases. The paper
addresses two challenges in operationalizing this approach: (1) Given a
simulation model, what information is needed so that a simulation run can start
from the current state of cases and resources? (2) How can the current state of
a process be derived from an event log? The resulting short-term simulation
approach is embodied in a simulation engine that takes as input a simulation
model and a log of ongoing cases, and simulates cases for a given time horizon.
An experimental evaluation shows that this approach yields more accurate
short-term performance forecasts than long-term simulations with warm-up
period, particularly in the presence of concept drift or bursty performance
patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解开发者为何重构及哪些指标能捕捉这些动机，可能支持在实践中更广泛和有效地使用重构。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究分析开发者的重构活动，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从版本控制数据中识别潜在动机，并与文献中报告的先前动机进行比较。

Result: LLMs在80%的情况下与人类判断一致，但仅与文献动机在47%上一致。它们丰富了22%的动机，更详细地突出了可读性、清晰性和结构改进。大多数动机是务实的，集中于简化和可维护性。与动机类别相关性最强的指标是开发者经验和代码可读性，但其相关性较弱。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效捕捉表面层次的动机，但在架构推理方面存在困难。它们的价值在于提供局部解释，结合软件指标可形成混合方法，为系统化优先重构和平衡短期改进与长期架构目标提供有前景的路径。

Abstract: Context. Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external

support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We
performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring
activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying
motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous
motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in
80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They
enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting
readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were
pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related
to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation
with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs
effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural
reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when
combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration
offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and
balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.

### [82] ["We provide our resources in a dedicated repository": Surveying the Transparency of HICSS publications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07851)
*Irdin Pekaric,Giovanni Apruzzese*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 分析了HICSS会议论文中外部存储库的使用情况，发现仅3%的论文提供了功能完善的公开存储库，显示研究透明度和可重复性仍有待提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估HICSS会议论文中利用外部存储库提供补充材料的程度，以促进研究的透明度和可重复性。

Method: 收集了2017-2024年HICSS会议收录的5579篇论文，筛选出涉及人类主题研究（850篇）或技术实现（737篇）的论文，最终分析了2028篇论文的文本和外部存储库链接及内容。

Result: 在分析的2028篇论文中，仅有3%提供了功能完善且公开可用的外部存储库。

Conclusion: 只有3%的论文提供了功能完善且公开可用的外部存储库，这表明在提高研究透明度和可重复性方面仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Every day, new discoveries are made by researchers from all across the globe
and fields. HICSS is a flagship venue to present and discuss such scientific
advances. Yet, the activities carried out for any given research can hardly be
fully contained in a single document of a few pages-the "paper." Indeed, any
given study entails data, artifacts, or other material that is crucial to truly
appreciate the contributions claimed in the corresponding paper. External
repositories (e.g., GitHub) are a convenient tool to store all such resources
so that future work can freely observe and build upon them -- thereby improving
transparency and promoting reproducibility of research as a whole. In this
work, we scrutinize the extent to which papers recently accepted to HICSS
leverage such repositories to provide supplementary material. To this end, we
collect all the 5579 papers included in HICSS proceedings from 2017-2024. Then,
we identify those entailing either human subject research (850) or technical
implementations (737), or both (147). Finally, we review their text, examining
how many include a link to an external repository-and, inspect its contents.
Overall, out of 2028 papers, only 3\% have a functional and publicly available
repository that is usable by downstream research. We release all our tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能（AI）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，网络安全领域，尤其是渗透测试自动化方面出现了新的机遇。本研究旨在探索利用LLM工具（如PentestGPT）自动化Android渗透测试的潜力。

Method: 本研究通过比较传统手动Root技术与AI生成的自动化技术，评估了自动化渗透测试在Android设备上的效能、可靠性和可扩展性。使用Android模拟器（Genymotion）作为测试平台，执行传统和基于AI的Root方法，并通过集成OpenAI API创建了一个便于自动化脚本生成的Web应用。

Result: 研究发现，AI生成的自动化脚本能够显著提升渗透测试的工作流效率，但同时也揭示了LLMs在准确性和伦理应用方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）能显著提升渗透测试的工作效率，但仍需人工控制以确保准确性和伦理应用。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the area of cybersecurity, especially
in the exploitation automation landscape and penetration testing. This study
explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools,
especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a
comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods
produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and
scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege
access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as
the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting
methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create
a web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script
generation from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the
effectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual
penetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths
along the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation,
including ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while
LLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be
controlled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study
adds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its
effect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security.

### [84] [Crossword: Adaptive Consensus for Dynamic Data-Heavy Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07157)
*Guanzhou Hu,Yiwei Chen,Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau,Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Crossword是一种灵活的共识协议，通过动态分片分配和擦除编码优化数据传输，显著提升动态工作负载下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云计算中动态数据密集型工作负载的复制负载大小差异大且带来间歇性带宽压力，现有协议难以灵活应对。

Method: Crossword采用每实例擦除编码，智能分配编码分片以减少关键路径数据传输，并通过惰性跟随者八卦机制优雅处理领导者故障转移。

Result: Crossword在动态工作负载和网络条件下性能提升高达2.3倍，与CockroachDB集成后TPC-C的聚合吞吐量提高1.32倍。

Conclusion: Crossword协议在动态数据密集型工作负载下表现出色，不仅匹配现有协议（如MultiPaxos、Raft等）在静态场景下的性能，还能在动态负载和网络条件下实现最高2.3倍的性能提升。与CockroachDB的集成进一步验证了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present Crossword, a flexible consensus protocol for dynamic data-heavy
workloads, a rising challenge in the cloud where replication payload sizes span
a wide spectrum and introduce sporadic bandwidth stress. Crossword applies
per-instance erasure coding and distributes coded shards intelligently to
reduce critical-path data transfer significantly when desirable. Unlike
previous approaches that statically assign shards to servers, Crossword enables
an adaptive tradeoff between the assignment of shards and quorum size in
reaction to dynamic workloads and network conditions, while always retaining
the availability guarantee of classic protocols. Crossword handles leader
failover gracefully by employing a lazy follower gossiping mechanism that
incurs minimal impact on critical-path performance. We implement Crossword
(along with relevant protocols) in Gazette, a distributed, replicated, and
protocol-generic key-value store written in async Rust. We evaluate Crossword
comprehensively to show that it matches the best performance among previous
protocols (MultiPaxos, Raft, RSPaxos, and CRaft) in static scenarios, and
outperforms them by up to 2.3x under dynamic workloads and network conditions.
Our integration of Crossword with CockroachDB brings 1.32x higher aggregate
throughput to TPC-C under 5-way replication. We will open-source Gazette upon
publication.

### [85] [Bodega: Serving Linearizable Reads Locally from Anywhere at Anytime via Roster Leases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07158)
*Guanzhou Hu,Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau,Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Bodega是一种新型共识协议，通过roster leases算法实现本地线性化读取，性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的共识协议在读取线性化方面存在性能瓶颈，尤其是在写入干扰下。Bodega旨在提供本地线性化读取，无论写入干扰如何。

Method: Bodega采用roster leases算法、乐观持有和早期接受通知等技术，最小化写入干扰，并通过智能roster覆盖和轻量级心跳提高实用性。

Result: Bodega在真实WAN集群上比现有方法快5.6x-13.1x，写入性能相当，支持快速roster变更和故障容忍。

Conclusion: Bodega通过其新颖的roster leases算法和优化措施，显著提升了读取性能，同时保持了与现有共识协议的兼容性和实用性。

Abstract: We present Bodega, the first consensus protocol that serves linearizable
reads locally from any desired node, regardless of interfering writes. Bodega
achieves this via a novel roster leases algorithm that safeguards the roster, a
new notion of cluster metadata. The roster is a generalization of leadership;
it tracks arbitrary subsets of replicas as responder nodes for local reads. A
consistent agreement on the roster is established through roster leases, an
all-to-all leasing mechanism that generalizes existing all-to-one leasing
approaches (Leader Leases, Quorum Leases), unlocking a new point in the
protocol design space. Bodega further employs optimistic holding and early
accept notifications to minimize interruption from interfering writes, and
incorporates smart roster coverage and lightweight heartbeats to maximize
practicality. Bodega is a non-intrusive extension to classic consensus; it
imposes no special requirements on writes other than a responder-covering
quorum. We implement Bodega and related works in Vineyard, a protocol-generic
replicated key-value store written in async Rust. We compare it to previous
protocols (Leader Leases, EPaxos, PQR, and Quorum Leases) and two production
coordination services (etcd and ZooKeeper). Bodega speeds up average client
read requests by 5.6x-13.1x on real WAN clusters versus previous approaches
under moderate write interference, delivers comparable write performance,
supports fast proactive roster changes as well as fault tolerance via leases,
and closely matches the performance of sequentially-consistent etcd and
ZooKeeper deployments across all YCSB workloads. We will open-source Vineyard
upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代科学工作流需要近实时数据分析和实验控制，而文件传输的延迟瓶颈限制了这一需求。内存到内存数据流传输可以消除这些瓶颈，但需要低延迟、高吞吐量和可靠的数据传输支持。

Method: 本研究通过使用来自Deleria和LCLS工作流的合成工作负载，在OLCF的Data Streaming to HPC基础设施中进行了RabbitMQ消息框架的流传输模拟。

Result: 模拟实验揭示了多个关键观察结果和实践见解，帮助用户理解哪些配置最适合其流传输工作负载的需求。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过仔细调整RabbitMQ消息框架的参数配置，可以显著优化科学工作流中的内存到内存数据流传输性能，满足低延迟、高吞吐量和可靠数据传输的需求。

Abstract: Memory-to-memory data streaming is essential for modern scientific workflows
that require near real-time data analysis, experimental steering, and informed
decision-making during experiment execution. It eliminates the latency
bottlenecks associated with file-based transfers to parallel storage, enabling
rapid data movement between experimental facilities and HPC systems. These
tightly coupled experimental-HPC workflows demand low latency, high throughput,
and reliable data delivery to support on-the-fly analysis and timely feedback
for experimental control. Off-the-shelf messaging frameworks are increasingly
considered viable solutions for enabling such direct memory streaming due to
their maturity, broad adoption, and ability to abstract core messaging and
reliability functionalities from the application layer. However, effectively
meeting the workflows' requirements depends on utilizing the framework's
capabilities and carefully tuning its configurations.
  In this paper, we present a study that investigates the messaging parameters,
and their configuration choices that impact the streaming requirements of two
representative scientific workflows. We specifically characterize throughput
trade-offs associated with reliable message transmission for these workflows.
Our study is conducted through streaming simulations using synthetic workloads
derived from the Deleria and LCLS workflows, employing the RabbitMQ messaging
framework within the context of the Data Streaming to HPC infrastructure at
OLCF. Our simulations reveal several key observations and practical insights
that help users understand which configurations best meet the needs of their
streaming workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网设备的普及，Fog计算成为处理低延迟应用的关键技术，但面临资源分配和任务调度的挑战。本文旨在设计一种任务调度算法，以最小化能源消耗并提升服务质量。

Method: 论文将Fog节点按流量水平分为低和高两类，低流量节点使用改进的金鹰优化算法（IGEO）调度低截止时间任务，高流量节点使用强化学习（RL）处理高截止时间任务。这种组合方法称为强化改进金鹰优化（RIGEO）算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，RIGEO算法在系统响应时间、总截止时间违规时间及能源消耗方面优于现有先进算法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的RIGEO算法通过结合改进的金鹰优化算法和强化学习，有效优化了Fog计算环境中的任务调度，显著降低了能源消耗并提升了服务质量。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the development of
numerous applications that require quick responses and low latency. Fog
computing has emerged as a solution for processing these IoT applications, but
it faces challenges such as resource allocation and job scheduling. Therefore,
it is crucial to determine how to assign and schedule tasks on Fog nodes. A
well-designed job scheduling algorithm can help decrease energy usage and
improve response times for application requests. This work aims to schedule
tasks in IoT while minimizing the total energy consumption of nodes and
enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks, taking into
account task deadlines. Initially, this paper classifies the Fog nodes into two
categories based on their traffic level: low and high. It schedules
low-deadline tasks on low-traffic-level nodes using an Improved Golden Eagle
Optimization (IGEO) algorithm, an enhancement of the Golden Eagle Optimization
Algorithm that utilizes genetic operators for discretization. High-deadline
tasks are processed on high-traffic nodes using reinforcement learning (RL).
This combined approach is called the Reinforcement Improved Golden Eagle
Optimization (RIGEO) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms optimize system response time, total deadline violation
time, and resource and system energy consumption compared to other
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: DuoServe-MoE通过分阶段优化调度策略，显著提升MoE模型推理效率并降低内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE推理的两个阶段（prefill和decode）具有不同的特性，统一调度策略导致延迟和内存使用不理想。

Method: 提出了DuoServe-MoE系统，分别处理prefill和decode阶段，采用两阶段CUDA流水线和轻量级预测器来优化内存和延迟。

Result: 在4-bit Mixtral-8x7B和8x22B模型上，DuoServe-MoE将端到端延迟降低了1.42至7.54倍，峰值内存使用仅为完整模型大小的15%。

Conclusion: DuoServe-MoE显著提高了MoE模型的推理效率，降低了内存使用，适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a wide range of deep learning tasks. Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances
their capabilities by increasing model width through sparsely activated expert
branches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large
number of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially
in resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More
importantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a
prefill stage where most experts are activated densely, and a decode stage
where only a few experts are triggered sparsely. Treating these stages with a
uniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage.
To address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference serving system that
explicitly separates prefill and decode stages and applies tailored expert
scheduling strategies to each. In the prefill stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a
two-stream CUDA pipeline that overlaps expert weight prefetching with the
computation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the
decode stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from
activation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts,
without requiring any changes to the model. Experiments on 4-bit Mixtral-8x7B
and 8x22B models show that DuoServe-MoE improves end-to-end latency by 1.42 to
7.54 times while keeping peak memory usage at only 15 percent of the full model
size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperledger Fabric在重负载下存在交易吞吐量低和拒绝率高的问题，主要源于背书、排序和验证阶段的瓶颈。乐观并发控制和延迟验证可能导致资源低效和竞争。

Method: 包括依赖标记系统、优化的区块构建、在区块内引入DAG表示依赖关系，以及并行执行独立交易。

Result: 在Hyperledger Fabric v2.5中测试，结果显示吞吐量提升了40%，高竞争场景下的拒绝率显著降低。

Conclusion: 提出的依赖感知执行模型显著提升了Hyperledger Fabric的性能，吞吐量提高了40%，同时降低了高竞争场景下的拒绝率。该方法与现有共识和智能合约层兼容，增强了Fabric的可扩展性。

Abstract: Hyperledger Fabric is a leading permissioned blockchain framework for
enterprise use, known for its modular design and privacy features. While it
strongly supports configurable consensus and access control, Fabric can face
challenges in achieving high transaction throughput and low rejection rates
under heavy workloads. These performance limitations are often attributed to
endorsement, ordering, and validation bottlenecks. Further, optimistic
concurrency control and deferred validation in Fabric may lead to resource
inefficiencies and contention, as conflicting transactions are identified only
during the commit phase. To address these challenges, we propose a
dependency-aware execution model for Hyperledger Fabric. Our approach includes:
(a) a dependency flagging system during endorsement, marking transactions as
independent or dependent using a hashmap; (b) an optimized block construction
in the ordering service that prioritizes independent transactions; (c) the
incorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within each block to represent
dependencies; and (d) parallel execution of independent transactions at the
committer, with dependent transactions processed according to DAG order.
Incorporated in Hyperledger Fabric v2.5, our framework was tested on workloads
with varying dependency levels and system loads. Results show up to 40% higher
throughput and significantly reduced rejection rates in high-contention
scenarios. This demonstrates that dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based
execution can substantially enhance Fabric's scalability while remaining
compatible with its existing consensus and smart contract layers.

TL;DR: Astra是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，用于优化GPU内核，直接从SGLang的CUDA实现出发，通过迭代优化实现平均1.32倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GPU内核优化方法需要大量手动调整，LLM的应用主要集中在将PyTorch模块转换为CUDA代码，而Astra直接从SGLang提取的CUDA实现出发，减少手动设计需求。

Method: Astra是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，通过迭代代码生成、测试、分析和规划来优化CUDA内核。

Result: 在SGLang的内核上，Astra使用零样本提示（OpenAI o4-mini）实现了平均1.32倍的加速。

Conclusion: Astra展示了多智能体LLM系统在GPU内核优化中的潜力，能够自主应用循环变换、优化内存访问模式、利用CUDA内部函数和快速数学运算，显著提升性能。

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection
of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are
crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet
attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.
Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial
manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using
LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on
translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we
introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel
optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA
implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving
LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,
specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,
profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and
high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of
1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study
further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,
optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast
math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights
multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel
optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造系统需要适应动态工作负载和定制化生产需求，而传统集中式资源分配方案存在扩展性、延迟和单点故障问题。

Method: DREAMS采用基于Raft的共识算法和成本效益投票机制，通过自治代理在各个计算域内协作优化微服务部署决策。

Result: 评估显示，DREAMS的关键协调操作（如LDM注册和迁移投票）在域数量增加时呈次线性扩展，证明了其高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: DREAMS框架通过去中心化的架构，在保证高容错性的同时实现了全球优化的服务部署，尤其适用于现代制造环境中的多利益相关者场景。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems require adaptive computing infrastructures that
can respond to highly dynamic workloads and increasingly customized production
demands. The compute continuum emerges as a promising solution, enabling
flexible deployment of microservices across distributed, heterogeneous domains.
However, this paradigm also requires a novel approach to resource allocation
and service placement, as traditional centralized solutions struggle to scale
effectively, suffer from latency bottlenecks, and introduce single points of
failure. In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that
optimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different
computational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate
autonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a
Raft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting. This decentralized
architecture enables responsive, privacy-preserving, and fault-tolerant
coordination, making it particularly suitable given the growing prevalence of
multi-stakeholder scenarios across the compute continuum. In particular, within
modern manufacturing environments, DREAMS achieves globally optimized service
placements while maintaining high fault tolerance. Further evaluations
demonstrate that key coordination operations, such as Local Domain Manager
(LDM) registration and migration voting, scale sub-linearly with the number of
domains, confirming the efficiency and scalability of our proposal.

Motivation: 由于绿色能源的间歇性和电力市场价格波动，HPC系统的能源预算变得复杂，需探索动态调整计算资源以应对价格波动的策略。

Method: 提出一个简单模型，利用关键系统参数评估可变容量策略对TCO的影响，并应用于大学HPC集群的实际数据。

Result: 模型显示可变容量策略在特定条件下可降低能源成本，但可能牺牲硬件利用率。实际数据验证了策略的潜在效益。

Conclusion: 论文通过模型分析表明，可变容量策略能在电力价格波动时有效降低HPC系统的总拥有成本（TCO），但需权衡硬件利用率。未来需结合具体场景评估其成本效益。

Abstract: Energy costs are a major factor in the total cost of ownership (TCO) for
high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The rise of intermittent green energy
sources and reduced reliance on fossil fuels have introduced volatility into
electricity markets, complicating energy budgeting. This paper explores
variable capacity as a strategy for managing HPC energy costs - dynamically
adjusting compute resources in response to fluctuating electricity prices.
While this approach can lower energy expenses, it risks underutilizing costly
hardware. To evaluate this trade-off, we present a simple model that helps
operators estimate the TCO impact of variable capacity strategies using key
system parameters. We apply this model to real data from a university HPC
cluster and assess how different scenarios could affect the cost-effectiveness
of this approach in the future.

Motivation: 尽管代理AI系统在结合决策生成和工具操作方面表现出强大潜力，但在面对多工具、复杂多步任务和长上下文管理时仍存在困难。为了解决这些问题，研究旨在提出一种更高效的工作流模式。

Method: 研究提出了AgentX工作流模式，包括阶段设计器、规划器和执行器代理，并利用模型上下文协议（MCP）工具。此外，提出了两种MCP服务器作为云函数即服务（FaaS）的部署方式。通过实证评估，比较了AgentX与ReAct和Magnetic One在三种实际应用中的成功率、延迟和成本。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has rapidly transformed various
fields including code generation, text summarization, image generation and so
on. Agentic AI is a recent evolution that further advances this by coupling the
decision making and generative capabilities of LLMs with actions that can be
performed using tools. While seemingly powerful, Agentic systems often struggle
when faced with numerous tools, complex multi-step tasks,and long-context
management to track history and avoid hallucinations. Workflow patterns such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct help address this. Here, we define a novel
agentic workflow pattern, AgentX, composed of stage designer, planner, and
executor agents that is competitive or better than the state-of-the-art agentic
patterns. We also leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, and propose two
alternative approaches for deploying MCP servers as cloud Functions as a
Service (FaaS). We empirically evaluate the success rate, latency and cost for
AgentX and two contemporary agentic patterns, ReAct and Magentic One, using
these the FaaS and local MCP server alternatives for three practical
applications. This highlights the opportunities and challenges of designing and
deploying agentic workflows.

Motivation: 当前共享内存系统中原子多播协议较少，现有协议在性能和实用性上存在不足。

Method: TRAM采用覆盖树架构设计，针对共享内存系统优化。

Abstract: Atomic multicast is a communication primitive used in dependable systems to
ensure consistent ordering of messages delivered to a set of replica groups.
This primitive enables critical services to integrate replication and sharding
(i.e., state partitioning) to achieve fault tolerance and scalability. While
several atomic multicast protocols have been developed for message-passing
systems, only a few are designed for the shared memory system model. This paper
introduces TRAM, an atomic multicast protocol specifically designed for shared
memory systems, leveraging an overlay tree architecture. Due to its simple and
practical design, TRAM delivers exceptional performance, increasing throughput
by more than 3$\times$ and reducing latency by more than 2.3$\times$ compared
to state-of-the-art shared memory-based protocols. Additionally, it
significantly outperforms message-passing-based protocols, boosting throughput
by up to 5.9$\times$ and reducing latency by up to 106$\times$.

TL;DR: 对SCION架构的测量研究揭示了路径感知网络的高变动性和不对称性，提示多路径协议设计需调整以适应这些现实挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏关于路径感知网络实际动态的实证数据，阻碍了有效协议的设计。

Method: 通过全球SCIONLab测试床对SCION架构进行纵向测量研究，分析路径稳定性、多样性和性能。

Result: 测量揭示了测试床部分区域的高控制平面变动和短路径寿命，识别了路径差异现象，并观察到并发多路径传输在提高总吞吐量的同时可能降低单个路径的延迟和可靠性。

Conclusion: 协议设计（如MPQUIC）需明确考虑高变动性和路径不对称性，挑战了多路径协议设计的常见假设。

Abstract: Path-aware networks promise enhanced performance and resilience through
multipath transport, but a lack of empirical data on their real-world dynamics
hinders the design of effective protocols. This paper presents a longitudinal
measurement study of the SCION architecture on the global SCIONLab testbed,
characterizing the path stability, diversity, and performance crucial for
protocols like Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC). Our measurements reveal a dynamic
environment, with significant control-plane churn and short path lifetimes in
parts of the testbed. We identify and characterize path discrepancy, a
phenomenon where routing policies create asymmetric path availability between
endpoints. Furthermore, we observe a performance trade-off where concurrent
multipath transmissions can improve aggregate throughput but may degrade the
latency and reliability of individual paths. These findings demonstrate that
protocols such as MPQUIC should explicitly account for high churn and path
asymmetry, challenging common assumptions in multipath protocol design.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: DORA是一个基于深度强化学习的框架，用于在O-RAN中动态分配PRB，优化5G网络中的URLLC、eMBB和mMTC服务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络需要同时支持URLLC、eMBB和mMTC等异构服务类别，每种服务都有不同的QoS要求。在有限的频谱资源下满足这些需求需要自适应的、符合标准的无线资源管理。

Method: DORA采用基于PPO的RL代理，根据观察到的流量需求和信道条件动态分配PRB，并通过轮询方式在活跃UE之间确定性地处理切片内PRB调度。

Result: 在拥塞状态下，DORA优于三种非学习基准和DQN代理，实现了更低的URLLC延迟、更高的eMBB吞吐量、更少的SLA违规和更广的mMTC覆盖范围。

Conclusion: DORA是一种在O-RAN中首次实现的完全在线DRL框架，用于自适应的、切片感知的PRB分配，显著提升了URLLC延迟、eMBB吞吐量和mMTC覆盖范围，同时减少了SLA违规。

Abstract: The fifth generation (5G) of wireless networks must simultaneously support
heterogeneous service categories, including Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency
Communications (URLLC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive
Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), each with distinct Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements. Meeting these demands under limited spectrum resources requires
adaptive and standards-compliant radio resource management. We present DORA
(Dynamic O-RAN Resource Allocation), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
framework for dynamic slice-level Physical Resource Block (PRB) allocation in
Open RAN. DORA employs a PPO-based RL agent to allocate PRBs across URLLC,
eMBB, and mMTC slices based on observed traffic demands and channel conditions.
Intra-slice PRB scheduling is handled deterministically via round-robin among
active UEs, simplifying control complexity and improving training stability.
Unlike prior work, DORA supports online training and adapts continuously to
evolving traffic patterns and cross-slice contention. Implemented in the
standards-compliant OpenAirInterface (OAI) RAN stack and designed for
deployment as an O-RAN xApp, DORA integrates seamlessly with RAN Intelligent
Controllers (RICs). Extensive evaluation under congested regimes shows that
DORA outperforms three non-learning baselines and a \texttt{DQN} agent,
achieving lower URLLC latency, higher eMBB throughput with fewer SLA
violations, and broader mMTC coverage without starving high-priority slices. To
our knowledge, this is the first fully online DRL framework for adaptive,
slice-aware PRB allocation in O-RAN.

TL;DR: TEGRA是一种基于SBA的高性能移动核心，解决了灵活性与可扩展性的权衡问题，显著提升了处理速度和部署效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G和6G移动核心正在向基于服务的架构（SBA）转变，但当前性能优化策略仍依赖传统的NFV技术，导致灵活性与可扩展性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出了弹性SBA微服务设计模式和状态管理策略，并开发了TEGRA系统。

Result: TEGRA在处理请求时比传统SBA核心实现（free5GC、Open5GS和Aether）快20倍、11倍和1.75倍，同时保持了灵活性，并显著减少了代码复杂度。

Conclusion: TEGRA作为一种高性能、灵活且可扩展的基于SBA的移动核心，成功解决了传统NFV技术中灵活性与可扩展性之间的权衡问题，显著降低了延迟并简化了新功能的部署。

Abstract: To support emerging mobile use cases (e.g., AR/VR, autonomous driving, and
massive IoT), next-generation mobile cores for 5G and 6G are being
re-architected as service-based architectures (SBAs) running on both private
and public clouds. However, current performance optimization strategies for
scaling these cores still revert to traditional NFV-based techniques, such as
consolidating functions into rigid, monolithic deployments on dedicated
servers. This raises a critical question: Is there an inherent tradeoff between
flexibility and scalability in an SBA-based mobile core, where improving
performance (and resiliency) inevitably comes at the cost of one or the other?
  To explore this question, we introduce resilient SBA microservices design
patterns and state-management strategies, and propose TEGRA -- a
high-performance, flexible, and scalable SBA-based mobile core. By leveraging
the mobile core's unique position in the end-to-end internet ecosystem (i.e.,
at the last-mile edge), TEGRA optimizes performance without compromising
adaptability. Our evaluation demonstrates that TEGRA achieves significantly
lower latencies, processing requests 20x, 11x, and 1.75x faster than
traditional SBA core implementations -- free5GC, Open5GS, and Aether,
respectively -- all while matching the performance of state-of-the-art cores
(e.g., CoreKube) while retaining flexibility. Furthermore, it reduces the
complexity of deploying new features, requiring orders of magnitude fewer lines
of code (LoCs) compared to existing cores.

TL;DR: NAAM通过eBPF实现动态消息处理位置选择，显著提升网络性能与扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RDMA操作受限、编程复杂及SmartNIC应用逻辑部署选择困难的问题，提供一种灵活、高效的网络加速方案。

Method: NAAM利用eBPF函数的可移植性，允许消息处理逻辑在客户端、服务器或SmartNIC上动态执行。通过RDMA类接口指定数据访问方式，结合NVIDIA BlueField-2 SmartNIC实现高效负载转移。

Result: NAAM在YCSB-B测试中动态卸载180万次MICA操作/秒，750,000次Cell查找/秒，且支持数百个应用卸载，尾延迟影响极小。

Conclusion: NAAM（网络加速活动消息）通过动态调整消息处理位置，显著提升了网络应用性能，特别是在负载均衡和扩展性方面优于现有解决方案。

Abstract: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) improves host networking performance by
eliminating software and server CPU involvement. However, RDMA has a limited
set of operations, is difficult to program, and often requires multiple round
trips to perform simple application operations. Programmable SmartNICs provide
a different means to offload work from host CPUs to a NIC. This leaves
applications with the complex choice of embedding logic as RPC handlers at
servers, using RDMA's limited interface to access server structures via
client-side logic, or running some logic on SmartNICs. The best choice varies
between workloads and over time. To solve this dilemma, we present NAAM,
network-accelerated active messages. NAAM applications specify small, portable
eBPF functions associated with messages. Each message specifies what data it
accesses using an RDMA-like interface. NAAM runs at various places in the
network, including at clients, on server-attached SmartNICs, and server host
CPU cores. Due to eBPF's portability, the code associated with a message can be
run at any location. Hence, the NAAM runtime can dynamically steer any message
to execute its associated logic wherever it makes the most sense. To
demonstrate NAAM's flexibility, we built several applications, including the
MICA hash table and lookups from a Cell-style B-tree. With an NVIDIA
BlueField-2 SmartNIC and integrating its NIC-embedded switch, NAAM can run any
of these operations on client, server, and NIC cores, shifting load in tens of
milliseconds on server compute congestion. NAAM dynamically offloads up to 1.8
million MICA ops/s for YCSB-B and 750,000 Cell lookups/s from server CPUs.
Finally, whereas iPipe, the state-of-the-art SmartNIC offload framework, only
scales to 8 application offloads on BlueField-2, NAAM scales to hundreds of
application offloads with minimal impact on tail latency due to eBPF's low
overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的优化框架，通过自然语言输入编码确保约束满足，优化任务分配并最小化延迟，展示了LLM在约束感知网络优化中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往无法强制执行约束，导致不可行解，而传统方法仅处理平均约束，因此需要一种新方法来保证严格约束满足。

Method: 框架通过自然语言输入编码策略限制解空间，确保可行性，并优化多接入边缘计算网络中的任务分配，以最小化最坏情况延迟。

Result: 数值评估表明，LLM在约束感知网络优化中是一个有前景的工具，并提供了对其推理能力的见解。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于LLM的优化框架，能够严格满足网络优化中的约束条件，展示了LLM在约束感知网络优化中的潜力。

Abstract: This work develops an LLM-based optimization framework ensuring strict
constraint satisfaction in network optimization. While LLMs possess contextual
reasoning capabilities, existing approaches often fail to enforce constraints,
causing infeasible solutions. Unlike conventional methods that address average
constraints, the proposed framework integrates a natural language-based input
encoding strategy to restrict the solution space and guarantee feasibility. For
multi-access edge computing networks, task allocation is optimized while
minimizing worst-case latency. Numerical evaluations demonstrate LLMs as a
promising tool for constraint-aware network optimization, offering insights
into their inference capabilities.

TL;DR: FlexSAN是一种自适应卫星接入网络架构，通过动态配置再生载荷，优化用户接入率和运营成本，实验证明其显著优于静态配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SAN配置静态且不灵活，可能导致资源浪费或用户体验差，因此需要一种能够根据实时用户需求动态选择最优再生载荷的架构。

Method: 设计了一种自适应贪婪启发式算法，以解决动态载荷选择的计算复杂度问题。

Result: 实验表明，FlexSAN相比静态SAN平均提高了36.1%的用户接入率，并降低了15%的运营成本。

Conclusion: FlexSAN提出的自适应卫星接入网络架构通过动态配置再生载荷，显著提高了用户接入率和降低了运营成本，验证了其在实时需求下的有效性。

Abstract: The regenerative satellite access network (SAN) architecture deploys
next-generation NodeB (gNBs) on satellites to enable enhanced network
management capabilities. It supports two types of regenerative payload,
on-board gNB and on-board gNB-Distributed Unit (gNB-DU). Measurement results
based on our prototype implementation show that the on-board gNB offers lower
latency, while the on-board gNB-DU is more cost-effective, and there is often a
trade-off between Quality-of-Service (QoS) and operational expenditure (OPEX)
when choosing between the two payload types. However, current SAN
configurations are static and inflexible -- either deploying the full on-board
gNB or only the on-board gNB-DU. This rigidity can lead to resource waste or
poor user experiences. In this paper, we propose Flexible SAN (FlexSAN), an
adaptive satellite access network architecture that dynamically configures the
optimal regenerative payload based on real-time user demands. FlexSAN selects
the lowest OPEX payload configuration when all user demands are satisfied, and
otherwise maximizes the number of admitted users while ensuring QoS for
connected users. To address the computational complexity of dynamic payload
selection, we design an adaptive greedy heuristic algorithm. Extensive
experiments validate FlexSAN's effectiveness, showing a 36.1% average
improvement in user admission rates and a 15% OPEX reduction over static SANs.

tackle key classes of problems in future mobile networks. By analyzing and
identifying common features, particularly their graph-centric representation,
we propose a unified strategy involving QC algorithms. Specifically, we outline
a methodology for optimization using quantum annealing as well as quantum
reinforcement learning. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges that QC
algorithms and hardware must overcome to effectively optimize future networks.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: MSwift通过中位数反馈机制改进多路径路由下的拥塞控制性能，提升FCT高达25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拥塞控制算法（CCAs）在多路径路由下因重复ACKs导致性能下降，甚至崩溃，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出并实现MSwift，将中位数反馈机制应用于Google的Swift算法，以增强其对多路径路由的适应性。

Result: MSwift在随机包喷洒和自适应路由下，将第99百分位FCT提升了高达25%。

Conclusion: MSwift通过采用中位数反馈机制，显著提升了多路径路由下的性能，同时保持了单路径性能和incast容忍性。

Abstract: Per-packet load-balancing approaches are increasingly deployed in datacenter
networks. However, their combination with existing congestion control
algorithms (CCAs) may lead to poor performance, and even state-of-the-art CCAs
can collapse due to duplicate ACKs. A typical approach to handle this collapse
is to make CCAs resilient to duplicate ACKs.
  In this paper, we first model the throughput collapse of a wide array of CCAs
when some of the paths are congested. We show that addressing duplicate ACKs is
insufficient. Instead, we explain that since CCAs are typically designed for
single-path routing, their estimation function focuses on the latest feedback
and mishandles feedback that reflects multiple paths. We propose to use a
median feedback that is more robust to the varying signals that come with
multiple paths. We introduce MSwift, which applies this principle to make
Google's Swift robust to multi-path routing while keeping its incast tolerance
and single-path performance. Finally, we demonstrate that MSwift improves the
99th-percentile FCT by up to 25\%, both with random packet spraying and
adaptive routing.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-finger grasping is a fundamental capability in robotic
manipulation. Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend
to be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an
alternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A
generator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,
and a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the
planner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started
with the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing
lower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple
trajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the
threshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a
successful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success
likelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a
successful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a
framework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in
parallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting
trajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To
plan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a
vectorized motion planner. Our experiments show our approach improves over the
traditional generator-evaluator-planner framework across different objects,
generators, and motion planners, and successfully generalizes to novel
environments in the real world, including different shelves and table heights.

Conclusion: 本研究建立了一个基础的、量子原生的机器人运动学优化框架，有效连接了量子计算和机器人问题。

Abstract: Optimizing high-degree of freedom robotic manipulators requires searching
complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces, a task that is computationally
challenging for classical methods. This paper introduces a quantum native
framework that integrates quantum machine learning with Grover's algorithm to
solve kinematic optimization problems efficiently. A parameterized quantum
circuit is trained to approximate the forward kinematics model, which then
constructs an oracle to identify optimal configurations. Grover's algorithm
leverages this oracle to provide a quadratic reduction in search complexity.
Demonstrated on 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm manipulator tasks, the method
achieves significant speedups-up to 93x over classical optimizers like Nelder
Mead as problem dimensionality increases. This work establishes a foundational,
quantum-native framework for robot kinematic optimization, effectively bridging
quantum computing and robotics problems.

Motivation: 现有动态环境中的感知局部规划器多依赖经验鲁棒性而非动态障碍物的正式分析，动态间隙规划器旨在通过明确处理动态障碍物来提升规划性能。

Method: 通过跟踪自由空间的极坐标区域（间隙）并估计其动态，利用间隙传播算法预测可行区域，结合追踪引导理论生成局部轨迹，并在无间隙情况下进行障碍物中心的非间隙处理。

Conclusion: 动态间隙规划器在动态环境中表现优异，通过理论分析和实际部署验证了其碰撞避免行为的有效性。

Abstract: This chapter extends the family of perception-informed gap-based local
planners to dynamic environments. Existing perception-informed local planners
that operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical
robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of
dynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses
dynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar
regions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are
estimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.
Then, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap
propagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.
Lastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories
that are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally,
obstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps
exist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners
are benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in
dynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other
baselines in all environments. Furthermore, dynamic gap is deployed on a
TurtleBot2 platform in several real-world experiments to validate collision
avoidance behaviors.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of a point-cloud-based navigation
stack, MUONS, for autonomous off-road navigation. Performance is characterized
by analyzing the results of 30,000 planning and navigation trials in simulation
and validated through field testing. Our simulation campaign considers three
kinematically challenging terrain maps and twenty combinations of seven
path-planning parameters. In simulation, our MUONS-equipped AGV achieved a 0.98
success rate and experienced no failures in the field. By statistical and
correlation analysis we determined that the Bi-RRT expansion radius used in the
initial planning stages is most correlated with performance in terms of
planning time and traversed path length. Finally, we observed that the
proportional variation due to changes in the tuning parameters is remarkably
well correlated to performance in field testing. This finding supports the use
of Monte-Carlo simulation campaigns for performance assessment and parameter
tuning.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization in dense urban environments poses a fundamental
task in photogrammetry, geospatial information science, and robotics. While
imagery is a low-cost and widely accessible sensing modality, its effectiveness
on visual odometry is often limited by textureless surfaces, severe viewpoint
changes, and long-term drift. The growing public availability of airborne laser
scanning (ALS) data opens new avenues for scalable and precise visual
localization by leveraging ALS as a prior map. However, the potential of
ALS-based localization remains underexplored due to three key limitations: (1)
the lack of platform-diverse datasets, (2) the absence of reliable ground-truth
generation methods applicable to large-scale urban environments, and (3)
limited validation of existing Image-to-Point Cloud (I2P) algorithms under
aerial-ground cross-platform settings. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a new large-scale dataset that integrates ground-level imagery from
mobile mapping systems with ALS point clouds collected in Wuhan, Hong Kong, and
San Francisco.

Abstract: Traditional online Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods often suffer from
excessive computational complexity, limiting their practical deployment.
Explicit MPC mitigates online computational load by pre-computing control
policies offline; however, existing explicit MPC methods typically rely on
simplified system dynamics and cost functions, restricting their accuracy for
complex systems. This paper proposes TransMPC, a novel Transformer-based
explicit MPC algorithm capable of generating highly accurate control sequences
in real-time for complex dynamic systems. Specifically, we formulate the MPC
policy as an encoder-only Transformer leveraging bidirectional self-attention,
enabling simultaneous inference of entire control sequences in a single forward
pass. This design inherently accommodates variable prediction horizons while
ensuring low inference latency. Furthermore, we introduce a direct policy
optimization framework that alternates between sampling and learning phases.
Unlike imitation-based approaches dependent on precomputed optimal
trajectories, TransMPC directly optimizes the true finite-horizon cost via
automatic differentiation. Random horizon sampling combined with a replay
buffer provides independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training
samples, ensuring robust generalization across varying states and horizon
lengths. Extensive simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments
validate the effectiveness of TransMPC in terms of solution accuracy,
adaptability to varying horizons, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted great interest due to its potential
capability in full-unsupervised driving. Model-based and learning-based methods
are widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined
models of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal
policy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the
above limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However,
existing PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training
efficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are
equivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper
develops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a
risk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a
safety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting
areas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO.
The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding
vehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during
training. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold
channel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images.
Moreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions
with risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation
results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak
reward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky
areas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.

Abstract: Service robots have demonstrated significant potential for autonomous trolley
collection and redistribution in public spaces like airports or warehouses to
improve efficiency and reduce cost. Usually, a fully autonomous system for the
collection and transportation of multiple trolleys is based on a
Leader-Follower formation of mobile manipulators, where reliable docking
maneuvers of the mobile base are essential to align trolleys into organized
queues. However, developing a vision-based robotic docking system faces
significant challenges: high precision requirements, environmental
disturbances, and inherent robot constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose an optimization-based Visual Servoing scheme that incorporates active
infrared markers for robust feature extraction across diverse lighting
conditions. This framework explicitly models nonholonomic kinematics and
visibility constraints within the Hybrid Visual Servoing problem, augmented
with an observer for disturbance rejection to ensure precise and stable
docking. Experimental results across diverse environments demonstrate the
robustness of this system, with quantitative evaluations confirming high
docking accuracy.

Motivation: 当前语言辅助系统在时间关键场景中忽视了时间因素（如传达时长、理解延迟和执行时长），导致潜在延迟或歧义。论文旨在研究及时性与信息性之间的权衡。

Method: 采用增强状态的马尔可夫决策过程，结合强化学习和生成的离线分类数据集，设计了一个平衡及时性与信息性的框架。

Conclusion: 该论文的框架通过结合强化学习和离线分类数据集生成流水线，显著提高了时间关键场景中的成功率，并揭示了及时性与信息性之间的权衡，为优化人机交互通信开辟了新方向。

Abstract: In time-critical settings such as assistive driving, assistants often rely on
alerts or haptic signals to prompt rapid human attention, but these cues
usually leave humans to interpret situations and decide responses
independently, introducing potential delays or ambiguity in meaning.
Language-based assistive systems can instead provide instructions backed by
context, offering more informative guidance. However, current approaches (e.g.,
social assistive robots) largely prioritize content generation while
overlooking critical timing factors such as verbal conveyance duration, human
comprehension delays, and subsequent follow-through duration. These timing
considerations are crucial in time-critical settings, where even minor delays
can substantially affect outcomes. We aim to study this inherent trade-off
between timeliness and informativeness by framing the challenge as a sequential
decision-making problem using an augmented-state Markov Decision Process. We
design a framework combining reinforcement learning and a generated offline
taxonomy dataset, where we balance the trade-off while enabling a scalable
taxonomy dataset generation pipeline. Empirical evaluation with synthetic
humans shows our framework improves success rates by over 40% compared to
methods that ignore time delays, while effectively balancing timeliness and
informativeness. It also exposes an often-overlooked trade-off between these
two factors, opening new directions for optimizing communication in
time-critical human-AI assistance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing,
which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch,
bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand
object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and
palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70
environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy
transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot
hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered
baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on
reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These
results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time
from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, supporting more rapid and

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种实时应急轨迹优化框架，通过在线学习和FRS屏障约束动态适应HV不确定性，显著提升了自动驾驶的安全性和效率。


<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需在动态不确定环境中平衡安全性和驾驶效率，但周围人类驾驶车辆（HVs）的不可预测性和感知误差增加了挑战。传统保守型规划器会降低驾驶效率，而确定性方法在面对突发情况时可能失效。因此，需要一种能动态适应不确定性并确保安全性的方法。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while
balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by
the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and
perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving
uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners
degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter
serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected
maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency
trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered
online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies
multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS)
incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier
constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory
prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory
optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the
uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without
resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and
urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while
maintaining safety under uncertainty. The project page is available at

Abstract: Birds in nature perform perching not only for rest but also for interaction
with human such as the relationship with falconers. Recently, researchers
achieve perching-capable aerial robots as a way to save energy, and deformable
structure demonstrate significant advantages in efficiency of perching and
compactness of configuration. However, ensuring flight stability remains
challenging for deformable aerial robots due to the difficulty of controlling
flexible arms. Furthermore, perching for human interaction requires high
compliance along with safety. Thus, this study aims to develop a deformable
aerial robot capable of perching on humans with high flexibility and grasping
ability. To overcome the challenges of stability of both flight and perching,
we propose a hybrid morphing structure that combines a unilateral flexible arm
and a pneumatic inflatable actuators. This design allows the robot's arms to
remain rigid during flight and soft while perching for more effective grasping.
We also develop a pneumatic control system that optimizes pressure regulation
while integrating shock absorption and adjustable grasping forces, enhancing
interaction capabilities and energy efficiency. Besides, we focus on the
structural characteristics of the unilateral flexible arm and identify
sufficient conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling and control
remain effective in terms of flight stability. Finally, the developed prototype
demonstrates the feasibility of compliant perching maneuvers on humans, as well
as the robust recovery even after arm deformation caused by thrust reductions
during flight. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to achieve
an aerial robot capable of perching on humans for interaction.

Conclusion: OmniMap是首个能够同时捕获光学、几何和语义场景属性的在线映射框架，具有实时性能和模型紧凑性。

Abstract: Robotic systems demand accurate and comprehensive 3D environment perception,
requiring simultaneous capture of photo-realistic appearance (optical), precise
layout shape (geometric), and open-vocabulary scene understanding (semantic).
Existing methods typically achieve only partial fulfillment of these
requirements while exhibiting optical blurring, geometric irregularities, and
semantic ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMap. Overall,
OmniMap represents the first online mapping framework that simultaneously
captures optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes while maintaining
real-time performance and model compactness. At the architectural level,
OmniMap employs a tightly coupled 3DGS-Voxel hybrid representation that
combines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation
level, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and
introduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and
exposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal
constraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding.
Extensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering
fidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is
further evidenced through a variety of downstream applications, including
multi-domain scene Q&A, interactive editing, perception-guided manipulation,
and map-assisted navigation.

Abstract: This manuscript investigates the integration of positional encoding -- a
technique widely used in computer graphics -- into the input vector of a binary
classification model for self-collision detection. The results demonstrate the
benefits of incorporating positional encoding, which enhances classification
accuracy by enabling the model to better capture high-frequency variations,
leading to a more detailed and precise representation of complex collision
patterns. The manuscript shows that machine learning-based techniques, such as
lightweight multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) operating in a low-dimensional

Motivation: 现有控制器多为盲控或依赖计算-内存权衡不佳的融合骨干，难以处理长时程信用分配和高成本的自注意力机制。

Method: 基于 SSD-Mamba2 的选择性状态空间框架，通过硬件感知流和近线性扩展实现感知-动作策略的端到端训练。

Result: 在多样化运动控制场景中，该方法在回报、安全性（碰撞和跌倒）和样本效率上均超越现有基线，且在相同计算预算下收敛更快。

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2 提供了一个实用的融合骨干，支持可扩展、有预见性且高效的端到端运动控制。

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

Abstract: In robots task and motion planning (TAMP), it is crucial to sample within the

a 2-DOF space validate its theoretical efficiency, while its application on a
9-DOF autonomous mobile manipulator robot(AMMR) demonstrates superior
whole-body and decoupled control, excelling in battery disassembly tasks.

Abstract: Efficient exploration of unknown environments is crucial for autonomous
robots, especially in confined and large-scale scenarios with limited
communication. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative
exploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages
the complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a
graph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial
robot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground
robot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground
platform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale
spatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven
map compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct
resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical
details, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing
key data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map
integration for collaborative path planning. Simulation and real-world
experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving exploration efficiency while significantly reducing data
transmission.

Abstract: Explainability is a critical tool in helping stakeholders understand robots.
In particular, the ability for robots to explain why they have made a
particular decision or behaved in a certain way is useful in this regard.
Behaviour trees are a popular framework for controlling the decision-making of
robots and other software systems, and thus a natural question to ask is
whether or not a system driven by a behaviour tree is capable of answering
"why" questions. While explainability for behaviour trees has seen some prior
attention, no existing methods are capable of generating causal, counterfactual
explanations which detail the reasons for robot decisions and behaviour.
Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel approach which automatically
generates counterfactual explanations in response to contrastive "why"
questions. Our method achieves this by first automatically building a causal
model from the structure of the behaviour tree as well as domain knowledge
about the state and individual behaviour tree nodes. The resultant causal model
is then queried and searched to find a set of diverse counterfactual
explanations. We demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly explain the
behaviour of a wide range of behaviour tree structures and states. By being
able to answer a wide range of causal queries, our approach represents a step
towards more transparent, understandable and ultimately trustworthy robotic
systems.

Abstract: This study presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based control
framework aimed at enhancing the safety and robustness of the quadcopter, with
a specific focus on resilience to in-flight one propeller failure. Addressing
the critical need of a robust control strategy for maintaining a desired
altitude for the quadcopter to safe the hardware and the payload in physical
applications. The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic
Programming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the
challenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a
model-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high
computational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid
computation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge
arises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With
modifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were
trained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also
achieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the
robustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were
conducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and
underscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications. A
comparative analysis was performed between both RL algorithms and their
potential for applications in faulty aerial systems.

Conclusion: SPERO克服了长期存在的停转旋翼飞行挑战，实现了VTOL与前飞之间稳定、双向的过渡，并建立了一个可推广的设计与控制框架。

Abstract: Stop-rotor aircraft have long been proposed as the ideal vertical takeoff and
landing (VTOL) aircraft for missions with equal time spent in both flight
regimes, such as agricultural monitoring, search and rescue, and last-mile
delivery. Featuring a central lifting surface that rotates in VTOL to generate
vertical thrust and locks in forward flight to generate passive lift, the
stop-rotor offers the potential for high efficiency across both modes. However,
practical implementation has remained infeasible due to aerodynamic and
stability conflicts between flight modes. In this work, we present SPERO
(Stopped-Penta Rotor), a stop-rotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a
flipping and latching wing, an active center of pressure mechanism, thrust
vectored counterbalances, a five-rotor architecture, and an eleven-state
machine flight controller coordinating geometric and controller
reconfiguration. Furthermore, SPERO establishes a generalizable design and
control framework for stopped-rotor UAVs. Together, these innovations overcome
longstanding challenges in stop-rotor flight and enable the first stable,
bidirectional transition between VTOL and forward flight.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模块化的可编程锁定单元（PLC），通过机械互锁实现高刚度变化，验证了其在夹持器和管道机器人中的应用，展示了可重构形态和任务适应性交互的潜力。


<details>

Motivation: 机器人系统在非结构化环境中运行时需要在柔性和刚性状态之间切换，但现有解决方案往往依赖复杂的驱动方案、持续输入功率或整体设计，限制了模块化和可扩展性。

Method: 本文提出了可编程锁定单元（PLC），这是一种模块化、肌腱驱动的单元，通过电缆张力驱动的机械互锁关节实现离散刚度调节。

Conclusion: PLC作为一种可扩展的、以结构为中心的机制，实现了可编程的刚度和运动，使机器人系统具备可重构形态和任务适应性交互能力。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating in unstructured environments require the ability to
switch between compliant and rigid states to perform diverse tasks such as
adaptive grasping, high-force manipulation, shape holding, and navigation in
constrained spaces, among others. However, many existing variable stiffness
solutions rely on complex actuation schemes, continuous input power, or
monolithic designs, limiting their modularity and scalability. This paper
presents the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC)-a modular, tendon-driven unit that
achieves discrete stiffness modulation through mechanically interlocked joints
actuated by cable tension. Each unit transitions between compliant and firm
states via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high
stiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under
high payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into
reconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We
validate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness
gripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation;
and (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves
shape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These
results demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for
programmable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable
morphology and task-adaptive interaction.

Motivation: 现有基于人类遥操作的专家数据收集效率低下，导致机器人策略在接触密集、可变形物体和长时程任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出RaC（人类干预滚动训练）阶段，在模仿学习预训练后，通过人类干预轨迹进行微调，包括回退到熟悉状态和提供纠正行为。

Result: 在三个真实世界双手机器人控制任务和一个模拟装配任务中，RaC表现优于现有方法，且测试时性能随恢复行为数量线性提升。

Conclusion: RaC通过引入人类干预轨迹的微调阶段，显著提升了机器人策略在长时程任务中的效率和鲁棒性，且数据收集时间减少10倍。

Abstract: Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on
large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich,
deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,
even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency
of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.
To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on
human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we
fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate
recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human
operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot
back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective
segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition
expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,
which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on
long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt
hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated
assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less
data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time
scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the
number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are
available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.

Abstract: Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a
significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level
trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects,
spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we
introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that
enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution
directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an
information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively
highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues
are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently
integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance
efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy
that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit
geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly
benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial
generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation
achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the
language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When
deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89%
placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking,
letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong
generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Motivation: 当前Vision-Language-Action模型缺乏集成力信号（如扭矩）的能力，限制了其在需要物理反馈的机器人操作任务中的应用。

Method: 系统研究了将扭矩信号集成到现有VLA架构中的设计空间，评估了多种策略，包括在解码器中引入扭矩适配器和预测扭矩作为辅助输出。

Result: 实验表明，在解码器中引入扭矩适配器优于编码器，预测扭矩作为辅助输出进一步提升了模型性能，并帮助模型建立了物理交互动力学的内部表示。

Conclusion: 引入扭矩适配器和预测扭矩作为辅助输出的策略显著提升了Vision-Language-Action模型在力信号集成方面的性能，为接触丰富的操作任务提供了更有效的闭环控制。

Abstract: Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force
signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully
completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle
physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to
bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating
torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate
several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque
adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the
encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in
autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which
further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a
physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation
benchmarks validate our findings.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新算法，在随机顺序流中实现最优空间复杂度O(1/ε log n)，扩展了现有算法的适用范围至更小的ε值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在特定条件下（如常数ε）已达到最优空间复杂度，但对于ε=o(1)的情况可能仍有优化空间。本研究旨在探索更广泛的ε范围内实现最优空间复杂度的方法。

Method: 通过分析随机顺序流的特性，提出了一种新算法，能够在流元素顺序随机的情况下达到最优空间复杂度。对于部分随机顺序流，算法还利用了F2的常数近似值作为先验信息。

Result: 在随机顺序流和部分随机顺序流中，算法成功实现了O(1/ε log n)的最优空间复杂度，且适用于ε=Ω(1/2^√log n)的情况。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了在随机顺序流和部分随机顺序流中，可以实现最优空间复杂度O(1/ε log n)，扩展了现有算法的适用范围。

Abstract: Given a stream $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ of items from a Universe $U$ of size
$\mathsf{poly}(n)$, and a parameter $\epsilon>0$, an item $i\in U$ is said to
be an $\ell_2$ heavy hitter if its frequency $f_i$ in the stream is at least
$\sqrt{\epsilon F_2}$, where $F_2=\sqrt{\sum_{i\in U} f_i^2}$. The classical
$\mathsf{CountSketch}$ algorithm due to Charikar, Chen, and Farach-Colton
[2004], was the first algorithm to detect $\ell_2$ heavy hitters using
$O\left(\frac{\log^2 n}{\epsilon}\right)$ bits of space, and their algorithm is
optimal for streams with deletions. For insertion-only streams, Braverman,
Chestnut, Ivkin, Nelson, Wang, and Woodruff [2017] gave the $\mathsf{BPTree}$
algorithm which requires only $O\left(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon}\log n
\right)$ space. Note that any algorithm requires at least
$O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log n\right)$ space to output $O(1/\epsilon)$ heavy
hitters in the worst case. So for constant $\epsilon$, the space usage of the
$\mathsf{BPTree}$ algorithm is optimal but their bound could be sub-optimal for
$\epsilon=o(1)$. In this work, we show that for random order streams, where the
stream elements can be adversarial but their order of arrival is uniformly
random, it is possible to achieve the optimal space bound of
$O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log n\right)$ for every $\epsilon =
\Omega\left(\frac{1}{2^{\sqrt{\log n}}}\right)$. We also show that for
partially random order streams where only the heavy hitters are required to be
uniformly distributed in the stream, it is possible to achieve the same space
bound, but with an additional assumption that the algorithm is given a constant
approximation to $F_2$ in advance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了离散设置下的聚类维度缩减，提出了两个以双倍维度为参数的结果，实现了强维度缩减，并发现其与连续设置在维度和保证方面存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Johnson-Lindenstrauss变换是欧几里得空间中维度缩减的基本方法，但一般维度界限在特定问题中可以被绕过。本文旨在探索离散设置下的聚类维度缩减，以填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 探索了离散设置下的聚类维度缩减，提出了两个结果，均以数据集的双倍维度为参数。第一个结果表明维度$O_{\epsilon}(\operatorname{ddim} + \log k + \log\log n)$足以保证每个中心集的成本在$1\pm\epsilon$范围内保留，且这一维度是紧的。第二个结果通过放宽保证（仅保留所有近似最优中心集的成本）消除了$\log\log n$项。

Result: 在离散设置下，实现了维度$O_{\epsilon}(\operatorname{ddim} + \log k + \log\log n)$的强维度缩减，并通过放宽保证进一步优化了维度界限。

Conclusion: 本文在离散设置下实现了强大的维度缩减，发现其与连续设置在维度界限（依赖于双倍维度）和保留最优值之外的保证（如保留哪些聚类）方面存在差异。

Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform is a fundamental method for dimension
reduction in Euclidean spaces, that can map any dataset of $n$ points into
dimension $O(\log n)$ with low distortion of their distances. This dimension
bound is tight in general, but one can bypass it for specific problems. Indeed,
tremendous progress has been made for clustering problems, especially in the
\emph{continuous} setting where centers can be picked from the ambient space
$\mathbb{R}^d$. Most notably, for $k$-median and $k$-means, the dimension bound
was improved to $O(\log k)$ [Makarychev, Makarychev and Razenshteyn, STOC
2019].
  We explore dimension reduction for clustering in the \emph{discrete} setting,
where centers can only be picked from the dataset, and present two results that
are both parameterized by the doubling dimension of the dataset, denoted as
$\operatorname{ddim}$. The first result shows that dimension
$O_{\epsilon}(\operatorname{ddim} + \log k + \log\log n)$ suffices, and is
moreover tight, to guarantee that the cost is preserved within factor
$1\pm\epsilon$ for every set of centers. Our second result eliminates the
$\log\log n$ term in the dimension through a relaxation of the guarantee
(namely, preserving the cost only for all approximately-optimal sets of
centers), which maintains its usefulness for downstream applications.
  Overall, we achieve strong dimension reduction in the discrete setting, and
find that it differs from the continuous setting not only in the dimension
bound, which depends on the doubling dimension, but also in the guarantees
beyond preserving the optimal value, such as which clusterings are preserved.

Abstract: An important thread in the study of data-stream algorithms focuses on
settings where stream items are active only for a limited time. We introduce a
new expiration model, where each item arrives with its own expiration time. The
special case where items expire in the order that they arrive, which we call
consistent expirations, contains the classical sliding-window model of Datar,
Gionis, Indyk, and Motwani [SICOMP 2002] and its timestamp-based variant of
Braverman and Ostrovsky [FOCS 2007].
  Our first set of results presents algorithms (in the expiration streaming
model) for several fundamental problems, including approximate counting,
uniform sampling, and weighted sampling by efficiently tracking active items
without explicitly storing them all. Naturally, these algorithms have many
immediate applications to other problems.
  Our second and main set of results designs algorithms (in the expiration
streaming model) for the diameter and $k$-center problems, where items are
points in a metric space. Our results significantly extend those known for the
special case of sliding-window streams by Cohen-Addad, Schwiegelshohn, and
Sohler [ICALP 2016], including also a strictly better approximation factor for
the diameter in the important special case of high-dimensional Euclidean space.
We develop new decomposition and coordination techniques along with a geometric
dominance framework, to filter out redundant points based on both temporal and
spatial proximity.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了数据流中第二频率矩$F_2$估计的剩余小误差范围（$\varepsilon < 1/\sqrt{n}$）的空间复杂度空白，证明了高精度估计需要几乎存储整个数据流。此外，研究还通过两轮流算法展示了与单轮流算法在空间复杂度上的显著差异。

Abstract: Estimating the second frequency moment $F_2$ of a data stream up to a $(1 \pm
\varepsilon)$ factor is a central problem in the streaming literature. For
errors $\varepsilon > \Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$, the tight bound
$\Theta\left(\log(\varepsilon^2 n)/\varepsilon^2\right)$ was recently
established by Braverman and Zamir. In this work, we complete the picture by
resolving the remaining regime of small error, $\varepsilon < 1/\sqrt{n}$,
showing that the optimal space complexity is $\Theta\left( \min\left(n,
\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \right) \cdot \left(1 + \left| \log(\varepsilon^2 n)
\right| \right) \right)$ bits for all $\varepsilon \geq 1/n^2$, assuming a
sufficiently large universe. This closes the gap between the best known
$\Omega(n)$ lower bound and the straightforward $O(n \log n)$ upper bound in
that range, and shows that essentially storing the entire stream is necessary
for high-precision estimation.
  To derive this bound, we fully characterize the two-party communication
complexity of estimating the size of a set intersection up to an arbitrary
additive error $\varepsilon n$. In particular, we prove a tight $\Omega(n \log
n)$ lower bound for one-way communication protocols when $\varepsilon <
n^{-1/2-\Omega(1)}$, in contrast to classical $O(n)$-bit protocols that use
two-way communication. Motivated by this separation, we present a two-pass
streaming algorithm that computes the exact histogram of a stream with high
probability using only $O(n \log \log n)$ bits of space, in contrast to the
$\Theta(n \log n)$ bits required in one pass even to approximate $F_2$ with
small error. This yields the first asymptotic separation between one-pass and
$O(1)$-passes space complexity for small frequency moment estimation.

Motivation: 邻近图方法在系统社区中已成为近似最近邻搜索的主要范式，但现有构建方法的时间复杂度较高（$\Omega(n^2)$），且缺乏理论基础的深入理解。

Abstract: Proximity graph-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in the system community. This paper
presents fresh insights into the theoretical foundation of these methods. We
describe an algorithm to build a proximity graph for $(1+\epsilon)$-ANN search
that has $O((1/\epsilon)^\lambda \cdot n \log \Delta)$ edges and guarantees
$(1/\epsilon)^\lambda \cdot \text{polylog }\Delta$ query time. Here, $n$ and
$\Delta$ are the size and aspect ratio of the data input, respectively, and
$\lambda = O(1)$ is the doubling dimension of the underlying metric space. Our
construction time is near-linear to $n$, improving the $\Omega(n^2)$ bounds of
all previous constructions. We complement our algorithm with lower bounds
revealing an inherent limitation of proximity graphs: the number of edges needs
to be at least $\Omega((1/\epsilon)^\lambda \cdot n + n \log \Delta)$ in the
worst case, up to a subpolynomial factor. The hard inputs used in our
lower-bound arguments are non-geometric, thus prompting the question of whether
improvement is possible in the Euclidean space (a key subclass of metric
spaces). We provide an affirmative answer by using geometry to reduce the graph
size to $O((1/\epsilon)^\lambda \cdot n)$ while preserving nearly the same
query and construction time.

Conclusion: 本文首次对基于PLA的学习数据结构实现了最大压缩性的理论分析，并提供了具有强理论保证的新存储方案，同时建议了简单高效的实践实现。

Abstract: We study the problem of deriving compressibility measures for \emph{Piecewise
Linear Approximations} (PLAs), i.e., error-bounded approximations of a set of
two-dimensional {\em increasing} data points using a sequence of segments. Such
approximations are widely used tools in implementing many \emph{learned data
structures}, which mix learning models with traditional algorithmic design
blocks to exploit regularities in the underlying data distribution, providing
novel and effective space-time trade-offs.
  We introduce the first lower bounds to the cost of storing PLAs in two
settings, namely {\em compression} and {\em indexing}. We then compare these
compressibility measures to known data structures, and show that they are
asymptotically optimal up to a constant factor from the space lower bounds.
Finally, we design the first data structures for the aforementioned settings
that achieve the space lower bounds plus small additive terms, which turn out
to be {\em succinct} in most practical cases. Our data structures support the
efficient retrieval and evaluation of a segment in the (compressed) PLA for a
given $x$-value, which is a core operation in any learned data structure
relying on PLAs.
  As a result, our paper offers the first theoretical analysis of the maximum
compressibility achievable by PLA-based learned data structures, and provides
novel storage schemes for PLAs offering strong theoretical guarantees while
also suggesting simple and efficient practical implementations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的制造流程，通过微结构设计减少材料使用，同时保持功能，展示了在工业案例中的成功应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多材料3D打印等新制造技术的发展，作者质疑了传统几何CAD的五十年范式，旨在探索非固体、包含异质自由形式内部微结构的新一代CAD对象。

Method: 论文提出了一种统一的制造流程，涵盖设计、优化、制造和检查微结构自由形式几何体的所有阶段。

Result: 通过工业测试案例（blisk叶片）展示了该流程的有效性，证明了在维持所需压力限制的同时，材料使用显著减少。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个统一的制造流程，通过设计、优化、制造和检查微结构自由形式几何体，实现了与传统单一固体材料制造对象相同的功能，但材料使用更少、更轻、更便宜。

Abstract: With the evolution of new manufacturing technologies such as multi-material
3D printing, one can think of new type of objects that consist of considerably
less, yet heterogeneous, material, consequently being porous, lighter and
cheaper, while having the very same functionality as the original object when
manufactured from one single solid material. We aim at questioning five decades
of traditional paradigms in geometric CAD and focus at new generation of CAD
objects that are not solid, but contain heterogeneous free-form internal
microstructures. We propose a unified manufacturing pipeline that involves all
stages, namely design, optimization, manufacturing, and inspection of
microstructured free-form geometries. We demonstrate our pipeline on an
industrial test case of a blisk blade that sustains the desired pressure
limits, yet requires significantly less material when compared to the solid
counterpart.

TL;DR: SVGauge是首个针对文本到SVG生成的与人类评价对齐的评估指标，结合视觉保真度和语义一致性，在SHE基准测试中表现优于现有指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标（如FID、LPIPS或CLIPScore）无法满足SVG图像的符号和矢量特性需求，因此需要开发专门的评估标准。

Method: SVGauge通过结合视觉保真度（使用SigLIP图像嵌入并通过PCA和白化进行域对齐）和语义一致性（通过比较BLIP-2生成的SVG标题与原始提示在SBERT和TF-IDF组合空间中的相似性）来评估SVG图像。

Result: 在SHE基准测试中，SVGauge与人类判断的相关性最高，并能更准确地复现8种零样本LLM生成器的系统级排名。

Conclusion: SVGauge是一个针对文本到SVG生成的首个与人类评价对齐的参考基准，其评估结果与人类判断的相关性最高，并能更准确地复现系统级排名。

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

### [137] [Efficient Computation of Voronoi Diagrams Using Point-in-Cell Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07175)
*Yanyang Xiao,Yao Li,Juan Cao,Zhonggui Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效计算限制Voronoi图的新方法，通过边基搜索和点-单元测试优化裁剪过程，显著提升性能，并在GPU上实现并行化，实验证明其优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Voronoi图在许多应用中广泛出现，提高其计算效率的研究一直备受关注。本文旨在解决现有方法在计算限制Voronoi图时效率不足的问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于边基搜索的方案来寻找裁剪平面（双曲面），并通过点-单元测试确定空间点是否在目标Voronoi单元内。对于每个中间域-单元交集的边，仅当其两个端点分别位于对应Voronoi单元内和外时才会启动裁剪，从而仅涉及对最终结果有贡献的裁剪。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在性能上优于现有技术，不受站点分布的影响，并在GPU上实现了高效的并行计算。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖且高效的方法来计算由给定域限制的Voronoi图，通过边基搜索方案和点-单元测试显著提高了计算效率，并在GPU上实现了并行计算，实验结果表明该方法在性能上优于现有技术。

Abstract: Since the Voronoi diagram appears in many applications, the topic of
improving its computational efficiency remains attractive. We propose a novel
yet efficient method to compute Voronoi diagrams bounded by a given domain,
i.e., the clipped or restricted Voronoi diagrams. The intersection of the
domain and a Voronoi cell (domain-cell intersection) is generated by removing
the part outside the cell from the domain, which can be accomplished by several
clippings. Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search
scheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is
first set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.
Then, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will
launch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside
the corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be
found by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only
involves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great
advantage over the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, because each
domain-cell intersection can be generated independently, we extend the proposed
method to the GPUs for computing Voronoi diagrams in parallel. The experimental
results show the best performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art
ones, regardless of site distribution. This paper was first submitted to
SIGGRAPH Asia 2025.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出神经锥形辐射法，通过反射感知射线锥编码改进高频反射建模，实现实时高质量渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经辐射方法主要依赖位置特征编码，难以捕捉高频、强视图依赖的辐射分布，因此需要一种更高效的方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用基于神经辐射框架的反射感知射线锥编码方法，利用预过滤的多分辨率哈希网格近似光泽BSDF瓣，将视图依赖的反射特性直接嵌入编码过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在不同光泽度条件下均能实时生成高质量、无噪声的渲染效果，且保真度和真实感优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的神经锥形辐射法通过反射感知的射线锥编码，显著提高了高频反射分布的建模能力，并在各种光泽度条件下实现了实时、高质量、无噪声的渲染效果。

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

TL;DR: TaoGS是一种拓扑感知动态高斯表示方法，解耦运动和外观以支持长期跟踪和拓扑适应，实现高效建模和压缩，提供沉浸式体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体视频作为数字化动态物理世界的关键媒介，创建具有六自由度虚拟环境以提供沉浸式用户体验。然而，在保持长期跟踪的同时鲁棒地建模一般动态场景（尤其是涉及拓扑变化的场景）仍然是一个基本挑战。

Method: TaoGS是一种新型的拓扑感知动态高斯表示，通过解耦运动和外观来支持长期跟踪和拓扑适应。场景运动由一组稀疏的运动高斯表示，这些运动高斯通过时空跟踪器和检测帧间结构变化的光度线索持续更新。每个运动高斯锚定并动态激活一组局部外观高斯，这些外观高斯非刚性变形到当前帧以提供强初始化并显著减少训练时间。

Result: TaoGS能够高效建模细节纹理并保持时间相干性，即使在挑战性场景（如换装）下也能实现高保真渲染。通过引入全局高斯查找表，支持与标准视频编解码器自然对齐的40%压缩。

Conclusion: TaoGS提出了一种统一的、自适应的解决方案，用于在拓扑变化下实现可扩展的体视频，能够捕捉动态场景中的优雅运动和静态力量，提供与物理世界协调的沉浸式体验。

Abstract: Volumetric video is emerging as a key medium for digitizing the dynamic
physical world, creating the virtual environments with six degrees of freedom
to deliver immersive user experiences. However, robustly modeling general
dynamic scenes, especially those involving topological changes while
maintaining long-term tracking remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we present TaoGS, a novel topology-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that
disentangles motion and appearance to support, both, long-range tracking and
topological adaptation. We represent scene motion with a sparse set of motion
Gaussians, which are continuously updated by a spatio-temporal tracker and
photometric cues that detect structural variations across frames. To capture
fine-grained texture, each motion Gaussian anchors and dynamically activates a
set of local appearance Gaussians, which are non-rigidly warped to the current
frame to provide strong initialization and significantly reduce training time.
This activation mechanism enables efficient modeling of detailed textures and
maintains temporal coherence, allowing high-fidelity rendering even under
challenging scenarios such as changing clothes. To enable seamless integration
into codec-based volumetric formats, we introduce a global Gaussian Lookup
Table that records the lifespan of each Gaussian and organizes attributes into
a lifespan-aware 2D layout. This structure aligns naturally with standard video
codecs and supports up to 40 compression. TaoGS provides a unified, adaptive
solution for scalable volumetric video under topological variation, capturing
moments where "elegance in motion" and "Power in Stillness", delivering
immersive experiences that harmonize with the physical world.

Motivation: 多准则决策方法在处理不确定、复杂和冲突情况时能帮助决策者做出更好决策。模糊集理论能有效量化人类思维和感知中的不确定性，结合多准则决策方法可处理决策者判断中的模糊性。选择可再生能源是当前关键问题，涉及技术、管理和政治层面。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型，结合区间值Fermatean模糊集，有效解决了可再生能源选择中的不确定性和模糊性问题，为决策者提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

TL;DR: Spectral NSR 是一种基于谱学习的神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理实现高效推理，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了统一符号推理的直观性与谱学习的可扩展性和适应性，同时提升推理系统的准确性、速度和鲁棒性。

Method: 该框架利用图信号处理（GSP）和基于知识图谱拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择性滤波器，将符号推理的可解释性与谱学习的可扩展性和适应性相结合。

Result: 在 ProofWriter 和 CLUTRR 等推理基准测试中，Spectral NSR 表现出更高的准确性、更快的推理速度、更强的对抗扰动鲁棒性，以及更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR 被确立为一个可扩展且原则性的推理系统基础，提供了超越传统方法的透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.

Result: 实验表明，Instruction Agent 在 OSWorld 的一组任务中实现了 60% 的成功率，而所有顶级代理均未能完成这些任务。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent 提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，缩小了当前 GUI 代理与可靠的实际 GUI 任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Conclusion: 本文总结了现有Neurosymbolic（NeSy）框架的技术特点，并提出了推动该领域发展的建议。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

TL;DR: 提出一种深度学习去噪方法，有效提升肌电污染下皮肤神经活动信号的监测质量，适用于自然运动环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤神经活动（SKNA）作为非侵入性监测交感神经系统动态的窗口，其测量易受肌电污染，传统预处理方法在持续肌肉活动时效果有限。

Method: 提出了一种基于轻量级一维卷积自编码器和长短期记忆（LSTM）瓶颈的去噪方法，用于从受肌电污染的记录中重建干净的皮肤神经活动信号。

Result: 该方法将信噪比提高了9.65 dB，与干净SKNA的互相关从0.40提升至0.72，并在严重噪声水平下实现了91-98%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 深度学习重建方法能在显著肌电干扰下保留生理相关的交感神经爆发，使在自然、运动丰富的环境中进行更稳健的皮肤神经活动监测成为可能。

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL通过部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习，显著提升Text-to-SQL在工业级数据库和复杂问题上的执行准确率，实现最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及特定领域业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需改进以应对实际应用场景。

Method: 结合部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习，采用两种管道：1) 上下文学习框架与群体自我评估（语言强化学习），使用大型语言模型作为骨干；2) 链式思维强化学习管道，训练小型骨干模型（OmniSQL-7B）并采用两阶段强化学习。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD等基准测试中取得最优结果，工业级Spider2.0-SQLite基准测试中执行准确率分别比现有最优方法高7.4%和1.4%。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL框架在工业级数据库和复杂问题上实现了最先进的Text-to-SQL性能，通过部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习驱动自我改进，显著提升了执行准确率。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

Conclusion: FETCH分类器在低成本模型混合使用下实现了97.37%的分类准确率，显著降低了法律系统用户的引导成本，同时保持了高准确性。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Conclusion: BlendedNet通过提供公开的BWB气动数据集和端到端替代框架，解决了非常规气动配置数据稀缺的问题，并促进了数据驱动的气动设计研究。

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于云的LLM在医疗健康应用中存在的隐私、内存和延迟问题，探索SLMs在健康预测中的实际表现。

Method: 系统评估了SLMs在健康预测任务中的表现，采用了零样本、少样本和指令微调方法，并将表现最佳的微调SLMs部署到移动设备上。

Result: SLMs在效率和隐私方面表现优异，性能接近LLMs，但在处理类别不平衡和少样本场景时仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: SLMs虽然目前仍有不足，但作为下一代隐私保护的医疗监测解决方案具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

TL;DR: 研究挑战了中间标记长度反映问题难度的假设，发现其与真实复杂性关系不大，更多取决于与训练数据的分布距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨中间标记生成（ITG）中标记序列长度是否反映或与问题难度相关，以澄清Chain of Thoughts（CoTs）机制。

Method: 通过训练从头开始的变压器模型在A*搜索算法的推导轨迹上，评估模型在自由空间问题和分布外问题上的表现，分析中间标记序列长度与问题复杂性之间的关系。

Result: 发现中间标记长度与真实A*轨迹长度仅松散相关，且相关性仅在问题接近训练分布时出现，表明效果源于近似回忆而非真正的问题自适应计算。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了中间标记生成与问题难度自适应的假设，并警告不要将诸如R1系统中的较长序列自动解释为'思考努力'的证据。

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

Method: SATLUTION通过LLM代理在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下，直接演化求解器仓库，并自我进化其进化策略和规则。

Conclusion: SATLUTION框架成功将LLM代码进化能力扩展到全仓库规模，显著提升了SAT求解器的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过语言自我对弈（LSP）方法，预训练模型能够在无需额外数据的情况下提升性能，且效果优于数据驱动的基线方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Method: 提出了SheetDesigner框架，利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）进行零样本和免训练的组件放置与内容填充，结合规则和视觉反射策略。

Result: SheetDesigner在3,326个电子表格数据集上表现优于五个基线模型至少22.6%，但在对齐方面仍需改进。

Conclusion: SheetDesigner框架通过结合规则和视觉反射策略，显著提升了电子表格布局生成的性能，尽管在对齐方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架通过代理理论解决了组织采用LLM时的对齐问题，为AI对齐提供了新的理论视角和实践指导。

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的NeSy框架（如DeepProbLog）强制固定的流程，限制了建模复杂依赖关系的能力，尤其是在不规则数据结构（如图）中。

Method: 引入DeepGraphLog，一个新颖的NeSy框架，扩展ProbLog并引入图神经谓词，支持多层神经符号推理，允许神经和符号组件以任意顺序堆叠。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过扩展ProbLog与图神经谓词，提供了一个更灵活和表达能力更强的神经符号集成框架，有效克服了现有NeSy系统的关键限制。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Motivation: LLMs在推理过程中易生成错误内容，现有自我纠正方法因缺乏可靠错误定位信号和有限推理深度而效果受限。

Method: 提出了Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架和Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码方法，结合用户反馈和多路径推理。

Conclusion: FTR框架结合LTM解码显著提升了LLMs在自我纠正中的表现，尤其在数学推理和代码生成任务上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the noise and bias in existing Olympiad-level benchmarks by creating a more reliable and challenging evaluation suite.

Method: Introduced RIMO, a two-track benchmark: RIMO-N with single-integer-answer problems for deterministic checking, and RIMO-P with proof problems decomposed into sub-problems for automated step-by-step evaluation.

Result: Benchmarking of ten frontier LLMs showed a sharp performance drop on RIMO compared to older benchmarks, revealing a substantial reasoning gap.

Conclusion: RIMO benchmark highlights a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and Olympiad-level reasoning, providing a clear target for future research to bridge this gap.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Motivation: 帕金森病误诊率高，现有方法依赖单一分类器且忽视菌株间关联或时间动态，亟需更鲁棒的特征提取方法。

Method: 首先收集肠道微生物群数据，识别差异丰富的分类群；其次开发RFRE特征选择框架，结合生态知识增强可解释性；最后设计混合分类模型捕捉微生物数据的时空模式。

Result: BDPM在预测帕金森病方面表现出色，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: BDPM结合了创新的特征选择框架和混合分类模型，显著提高了帕金森病基于肠道微生物群的预测准确性，为早期诊断提供了新工具。

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于全球供应链不透明和数据碎片化，进行LCA复杂且困难。论文旨在通过结合AI技术和公开数据，简化碳足迹估算并提高可访问性。

Method: 结合生命周期评估（LCA）进展、公开数据库和知识增强AI技术（如检索增强生成），开发了一种估算食品产品从摇篮到大门的碳足迹的方法。

Result: 开发了一个聊天机器人界面，用户可以交互式探索复合餐的碳影响，并通过实时网络演示展示了概念验证系统。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种结合LCA进展、公开数据库和知识增强AI技术的方法，用于估算食品产品的碳足迹，并通过聊天机器人界面使结果更易访问。同时指出了数据库不确定性和AI误解等局限性。

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGR是一种新型的推理方法，通过动态调整推理深度来平衡效率与可靠性，实验证明其在提高准确性的同时节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型（LRLMs）的崛起为解决复杂任务带来了新的潜力，但其推理效率与可靠性之间的平衡是一个关键问题。

Method: 提出了一种受生成对抗网络中生成器/判别器框架启发的新方法，其中批评模型定期探测自身的推理以评估是否已达到自信的结论。如果没有，推理将继续，直到达到目标确定性阈值。

Result: 通过AIME2024和AIME2025数据集的实验表明，CGR提高了基线准确性，同时减少了令牌使用。多种子评估显示CGR稳定，减少了种子间的方差，并在惩罚性评分下提高了类似考试的表现。令牌节省分析显示CGR可以节省数百万令牌。

Conclusion: CGR通过将置信度整合到推理过程中，使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信赖性和资源效率，为在准确性和计算成本都重要的领域中的实际部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

TL;DR: 研究比较了向量和图检索RAG在教育QA中的表现，发现动态分支框架能优化回答准确性和效率，为教育应用提供实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）在课堂中使用时，常提供过时或虚假信息，误导学生。RAG通过外部资源增强LLMs的可靠性，但现有研究未考虑教学因素和实际部署成本。

Method: 研究使用了两种可访问的RAG范式（向量检索和图检索），并通过EduScopeQA数据集（3,176个跨学科问题）和修改后的教科书数据集进行评估。

Result: OpenAI向量检索RAG在低成本快速事实检索中表现良好；GraphRAG Global在主题查询中提供更丰富的教学答案；GraphRAG Local在修改后的教科书数据集中准确性最高。动态分支框架能提升保真度和效率。

Conclusion: 研究为教育者和系统设计者提供了实用的指南，通过动态分支框架整合RAG增强的LLMs到学习环境中，以提高回答的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

TL;DR: 研究利用小规模开源LLMs合成高质量代码指令数据，提出迭代自蒸馏方法降低成本，SCoder模型验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小规模开源LLMs作为高质量代码指令数据合成的潜力，以减少对专有LLMs的依赖和降低成本。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的迭代自蒸馏方法，结合多检查点采样和多方面评分策略进行初始数据选择，并引入基于梯度的影响估计方法进行最终数据过滤。

Result: 基于小规模合成器的代码指令数据集，开发了SCoder模型，实现了最先进的代码生成能力。

Conclusion: SCoder模型展示了最先进的代码生成能力，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: CP-Model-Zoo 是一个基于自然语言描述的约束编程模型检索系统，旨在帮助非专家用户更轻松地使用专家级模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程及其高级建模语言在解决问题方面具有潜力，但建模语言的复杂性、大量全局约束以及创建优质模型的技巧往往阻碍非专家用户选择 CP。

Method: 提出一个名为 CP-Model-Zoo 的辅导系统，该系统基于用户对组合问题的自然语言描述，从数据库中检索最接近的源代码模型。

Result: 实验表明，CP-Model-Zoo 在不同专业水平的用户输入描述下，能够以极高的准确率检索到正确的模型。

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo 系统通过利用专家编写的模型库，能够准确根据用户的自然语言描述检索到最接近的源代码模型，有效降低了非专家用户使用约束编程的门槛。

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

Conclusion: HiPhO作为首个专注于高中物理奥林匹克竞赛的基准测试，通过与人类对齐的评估，揭示了开源模型与顶尖学生之间的显著性能差距，以及闭源推理模型在物理推理能力上的优势。尽管某些模型表现优异，但仍有大幅提升空间。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

TL;DR: 研究开发了测量语言模型福利的新方法，发现偏好与行为之间存在关联，但测量一致性因模型和条件而异，未来需进一步探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何测量语言模型的福利，并验证偏好满足是否可作为福利的实证测量指标。

Method: 开发新的实验范式，通过比较语言模型的口头偏好报告与虚拟环境中的行为偏好，以及测试成本和奖励对行为的影响。

Result: 观察到陈述偏好与行为之间存在可靠的关联，表明偏好满足在某种程度上可以作为福利的测量指标。

Conclusion: 尽管存在模型和条件间的差异以及背景不确定性，研究结果表明语言模型的福利测量是可行的，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.
