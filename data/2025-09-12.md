### [1] [Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897)
*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2 是一种支持多模态查询和文档检索的统一模型，通过动态整合跨模态信息，在多个基准测试中表现优异，且效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: ReT-2 利用多层表示和具有 LSTM 启发的门控机制的循环 Transformer 架构，动态整合跨层和多模态信息，捕捉细粒度的视觉和文本细节。

Result: 在 M2KR 和 M-BEIR 基准测试中，ReT-2 在不同检索配置下均达到最先进性能，同时推理更快、内存使用更少。集成到检索增强生成管道后，进一步提升了 Encyclopedic-VQA 和 InfoSeek 数据集的性能。

Conclusion: ReT-2 是一种统一的检索模型，支持多模态查询和文档检索，通过动态整合跨层和多模态信息，显著提升了检索性能，并在推理速度和内存使用上优于现有方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSIM是一种新型3D场景评估指标，专注于物体性，更符合人类感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标评估整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异，因此需要一种更关注'物体'这一人类视觉感知基本单位的评估方法。

Method: 利用物体检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个物体的'物体性'。

Result: 用户研究表明，OSIM比现有指标更符合人类感知。

Conclusion: OSIM作为一种新的评估指标，更贴近人类感知，为3D场景重建和生成模型的评估提供了更准确的标准。

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

### [3] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过VDM和transformer提取并聚合特征，提升了动作识别的泛化能力，接近人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够在大范围上下文和视角变化下识别相同动作，而现有深度学习模型在此类泛化任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种结合VDM生成的特征和transformer聚合的方法，特别关注扩散过程早期时间步的语义信息提取。

Result: 模型在跨物种、跨视角和跨上下文的动作识别任务上均达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 使用基于Vision Diffusion Model（VDM）和transformer的方法，显著提升了动作识别的泛化能力，使其在跨物种、跨视角和跨上下文条件下接近人类水平的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

*Tung Vu,Lam Nguyen,Quynh Dao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个新型模块化提示框架，通过VulnGuard Prompt技术减少LLMs生成有害信息，特别保护弱势群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法无法从生成源头预防有害输出，特别是对弱势群体造成的影响。

Method: PromptGuard采用多模块设计，包括输入分类、VulnGuard Prompting、伦理原则集成等，结合数据驱动的对比学习和多目标优化理论。

Result: PromptGuard通过理论分析和实证研究，实现了25-30%的有害信息减少。

Conclusion: PromptGuard通过其模块化提示框架和VulnGuard Prompt技术，显著减少了有害信息的生成，并通过数学验证和理论分析证明了其有效性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [5] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Beta-SOD框架，通过Siamese网络和Beta混合模型解决Re-ID中的标签噪声问题，在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标重识别方法对标签噪声高度敏感，导致性能显著下降，需要一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用Siamese网络架构和Beta混合模型（Beta-SOD）来建模嵌入对之间的余弦相似度分布，结合二元交叉熵、对比和余弦嵌入损失进行联合优化。

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，Beta-SOD在10-30%噪声水平下表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为Beta-SOD的统计异常检测框架，用于解决目标重识别（Re-ID）任务中的标签噪声问题，并在多个数据集上展示了其优越性能。

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICA图像的低对比度、高噪声和复杂血管结构限制了现有分割和检测方法的临床效果，需改进准确性。

Method: 提出了SFD-Mamba2Net框架，结合了CASE模块和PHFP模块，分别用于增强血管结构的多尺度特征和逐步优化高频细节。

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net在冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测中表现优于现有方法，显著提高了准确性和临床适用性。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种结合自动分割和放射组学的全自动框架，用于预测结直肠肝转移的手术结果，显著提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌常转移至肝脏，显著降低长期生存率。现有的预后模型预测能力不足，尤其是在多灶性CRLM病例中。

Method: 研究提出了一种全自动框架，包括分割流程和放射组学流程。分割流程利用可提示的基础模型完成缺失标签，并提出了SAMONAI算法，显著提高了分割的准确性和效率。放射组学流程则使用SurvAMINN从右删失生存数据中联合学习降维和风险预测。

Result: 在包含227名患者的机构数据集上的广泛评估表明，该框架超越了现有的临床和基因组生物标志物，C-index提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将自动分割算法与基于放射组学的生存分析相结合，在结直肠肝转移（CRLM）中提供准确、注释高效且可解释的结果预测的潜力。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon算法通过进化搜索比较两种文本到图像模型的视觉表现差异，并发现特定提示下的独特视觉属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究两种文本到图像生成模型在视觉表现上的差异，以理解它们在不同提示下的表现差异。

Method: 引入了CompCon，一种进化搜索算法，用于发现一个模型输出中比另一个模型更普遍的视觉属性，并揭示与这些视觉差异相关的提示概念。

Result: 创建了ID2数据集，包含60个输入依赖的差异，并发现了一些模型间的视觉表现差异，如PixArt在提及孤独的提示下生成湿街道的场景，而Stable Diffusion 3.5在媒体职业提示下生成非洲裔美国人的形象。

Conclusion: CompCon算法成功识别了不同文本到图像生成模型在视觉表现上的差异，并揭示了触发这些差异的提示概念。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于U-Net的深度学习模型，能够有效识别和修复UAS图像中的云影和太阳耀斑区域，从而提高了水质参数估计的准确性。

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin通过融合局部卷积与全局自注意力，在小数据集上显著提升ViTs性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs在计算机视觉中表现出色，但在小数据集上因缺乏局部性和平移等变性等关键归纳偏置而表现不佳。

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，将可学习的局部特征增强模块集成到每个注意力块中，同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet等多个基准测试中，CoSwin均优于现有卷积和基于Transformer的模型，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: CoSwin通过结合局部卷积特征学习与全局自注意力机制，显著提升了在小规模视觉数据集上的性能，证明了局部-全局特征融合的有效性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

TL;DR: iMatcher是一种完全可微的点云配准框架，通过局部和全局几何一致性学习显著提升了匹配精度，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，提出了一种完全可微的框架iMatcher，以结合局部和全局一致性信息。

Method: iMatcher利用学习的特征预测几何一致的置信矩阵，包括局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，并通过双边源到目标和目标到源匹配的重新定位步骤进行细化，最后通过全局几何一致性学习预测点对匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI、KITTI-360和3DMatch等数据集上，iMatcher实现了95%-97%、94%-97%和最高81.1%的内点比率，展现了其在不同场景下的鲁棒性和优越性能。

Conclusion: iMatcher通过结合局部和全局几何一致性学习，显著提升了点云配准的精度和鲁棒性，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: 通过结合声学特征和弱监督优化，UltrON有效解决了传统方法在遮挡和稀疏标注下的局限性，为更准确的3D重建提供了新途径。

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

*Umair Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu是一个大规模乌尔都语图像字幕数据集，通过分层抽样和混合质量估计框架构建，旨在填补乌尔都语资源空白并减少语言偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语在多模态和视觉语言研究中资源匮乏，缺乏大规模高质量数据集，限制了乌尔都语能力系统的发展，并加剧了多语言视觉语言模型对高资源语言的偏见。

Method: 通过分层抽样从MS COCO中选取59,000张图像和319,000条乌尔都语字幕，使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，并通过混合多模态质量估计框架（包括COMET-Kiwi、CLIP相似性和BERTScore与回译）进行验证和迭代优化。

Result: COCO-Urdu在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF等基准测试中表现强劲，是目前最大的公开乌尔都语字幕数据集。

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu是当前最大的公开可用的乌尔都语字幕数据集，旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，并为包容性视觉语言系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer

Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

Conclusion: PCGM通过整合解剖学约束和概率图模型，成功生成了高质量的3D脑MRI图像，并首次在生成的合成图像中复现了疾病对大脑皮层区域的细微影响，为研究细微形态差异提供了重要工具。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated

medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Motivation: 现有的图卷积神经网络（GCNs）在人机交互动作识别中表现不佳，主要因为缺乏场景信息的有效表示和合适的学习架构。

Method: 提出了一种结合固定物体信息和多任务学习的方法，通过收集公共环境中的真实数据并构建包含交互和非交互动作的数据集进行评估。

Result: 提出的方法在识别交互和非交互动作时达到了99.25%的准确率，比基准模型提高了2.75%。

Conclusion: 通过结合固定物体信息和多任务学习方法，提出的方法显著提升了人机交互动作识别的性能，准确率达到99.25%，比仅使用人体骨架姿态的基准模型提高了2.75%。

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Motivation: 当前多光谱目标检测方法在特征融合时保留过多背景或噪声，限制了感知性能。

Method: 提出了基于跨模态特征对比和筛选策略的创新特征融合框架，包含两个新模块：MFRM（增强特征表示）和DFFM（动态计算差异特征）。

Result: 在FLIR、LLVIP和M$^3$FD数据集上，IRDFusion表现优于现有方法，证明了其鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: IRDFusion框架通过迭代反馈显著提升了跨模态特征融合的质量，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA框架通过协同设计量化和令牌修剪流程，显著提高了VLA模型的计算效率和推理速度，同时保持了核心模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc 是一种基于鸟瞰图的自监督框架，无需高精度地面真实姿态，即可在 LiDAR 全局定位任务中实现最先进的性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and

behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Conclusion: Talk2Event被设想为推动多模态和时间感知感知的基础，其应用涵盖机器人技术、人机交互等领域。

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Conclusion: GA-DMS框架通过数据优化和模型架构改进，显著提升了CLIP在人物表示学习中的性能，实现了多基准测试的最先进表现。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET 通过创新数据增强和几何约束，在低资源条件下实现高效 PET 成像任务支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 PET 成像中标记数据稀缺和计算资源不足的问题，构建高效且泛化性强的低资源基础模型。

Method: ALL-PET 采用潜在扩散模型（LDM）结合三项关键技术：1) Radon 掩码增强策略（RMAS）生成多样化训练样本；2) 动态多掩码（DMM）机制提升数据多样性；3) 透明医学注意力（TMA）增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 实验表明，ALL-PET 仅需 500 个样本即可实现高质量投影生成，性能媲美大数据集训练模型，且内存占用低于 24GB。

Conclusion: ALL-PET 是一种低资源、低样本需求的 PET 基础模型，通过创新的数据增强和几何一致性约束，在少量数据下实现了高质量的投影域生成，并支持多种 PET 成像任务。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANN在噪声条件下比PH更擅长预测2D图像的拓扑结构，因其能学习数据中的上下文和几何信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在噪声环境下，人工神经网络（ANN）与持久同调（PH）在推断数据拓扑结构方面的性能对比。

Method: 本研究比较了基于立方体复形和符号欧几里得距离变换（SEDT）的PH管道与经过训练用于预测2D二值图像中Betti数的监督神经网络。

Result: 研究表明，在噪声条件下，ANN能够超越PH方法，这可能是由于其从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验的能力。

Conclusion: 尽管仍在发展中，使用人工神经网络（ANN）进行拓扑估计在结构噪声下为持久同调（PH）提供了一种有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

Motivation: 现有调查大多按任务或家族对模型进行分类，忽视了数据集对架构演化的结构性影响。

Method: 采用数据集驱动的视角，分析运动复杂性、时间跨度、层次组合和多模态丰富性如何施加模型应编码的归纳偏差。

Result: 重新解读了从双流和3D CNN到序列、Transformer和多模态基础模型的里程碑，作为对这些数据集驱动压力的具体回应。

Conclusion: 这篇综述通过将数据集、归纳偏差和架构统一到一个连贯的框架中，为通用视频理解的进步提供了全面的回顾和前瞻性的路线图。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的细胞检测模型难以模拟病理学家在不同放大倍数下的行为，缺乏多尺度重叠细胞和组织注释的数据集。

Method: 参与者提出了多种模型，通过整合细胞与组织关系（多尺度语义）来优化细胞检测。

Result: 最佳模型在测试集上F1分数比基线（仅细胞模型）提高了7.99，验证了细胞-组织关系的重要性。

Conclusion: 本文通过OCELOT 2023挑战赛展示了多尺度语义（细胞与组织关系）在细胞检测模型中的重要性，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Motivation: 无人机（UAV）图像中的目标检测面临密集小目标、尺度变化和遮挡等挑战，现有方法在这些问题上表现不佳。

Method: 论文提出了RT-DETR++模型，改进了RT-DETR的编码器部分。主要改进包括：1. 引入基于通道门控注意力的上采样/下采样（AU/AD）机制，通过双路径系统减少特征层传播中的误差并保留细节；2. 在特征融合中引入CSP-PAC技术，利用并行空洞卷积在同一层处理局部和上下文信息，以整合多尺度特征。

Conclusion: 本研究为实时检测系统中的特征编码设计提供了一种有效方法，RT-DETR++在保持实时检测速度的同时，显著提升了小目标和密集目标的检测性能。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

Motivation: 现有方法在知识检索中直接引入外部知识源的信息，忽视了知识冗余问题，导致噪声干扰回答过程。

Method: 1. 通过图像-问题对提取低噪声查询以增强知识检索的相关性；2. 利用大模型识别和提取对答案有益的知识片段；3. 引入选择性知识整合策略，仅在模型对答案缺乏信心时整合知识。

Result: 实验表明，所提框架优于现有最先进方法，能够获取准确且关键的知识。

Conclusion: 提出的训练无关框架通过知识聚焦和选择性知识整合策略，有效减少了知识冗余和噪声，提高了KB-VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术在林业生态和精准农业等领域具有重要应用价值，但其高维度和光谱混合特性导致特征冗余问题突出，限制了分类性能。

Method: 本研究采用ZY1F卫星的高光谱图像作为数据源，提出了一种名为CWSSNet的分类框架，该框架整合了3D光谱-空间特征和小波卷积，并利用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，CWSSNet在mIoU、mAcc和mF1上分别达到74.50%、82.73%和84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地分类中获得了最高的IoU，且在小样本训练条件下性能稳定。

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架通过整合3D光谱-空间特征和小波卷积，有效解决了高光谱图像分类中的特征冗余问题，并在小样本训练条件下保持了可靠的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated

methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

Motivation: 现有方法在低光环境下使用RAW-RGB图像时存在信息丢失或框架复杂的问题，需要一个轻量级且自适应的解决方案。

Method: 将传统ISP流程解构为可微分的线性（传感器校准）和非线性（色调映射）子模块，并引入内容感知适应性和物理先验知识，通过任务驱动的损失函数优化。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在低光环境下优于现有RGB和RAW检测方法。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP通过轻量级自适应ISP插件，显著提升了低光环境下目标检测的性能，且参数极少。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Conclusion: MGTraj通过多粒度轨迹建模和递归细化网络，显著提升了目标引导下的人类轨迹预测性能，在多个数据集中达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Conclusion: Medverse 提出了一种通用的 ICL 模型，通过多任务训练和跨器官、模态的评估，显著优于现有基线，为医学影像的上下文学习设立了新范式。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在牙科等专业领域的表现不足，尤其是全景X射线解读，缺乏相关数据集和基准。

Method: 引入MMOral数据集和OralGPT模型，通过监督微调（SFT）提升LVLMs性能。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到41.45%准确率，而OralGPT通过SFT提升了24.73%。

Conclusion: MMOral和OralGPT为智能牙科提供了重要基础，显著提升了LVLMs在牙科领域的性能，具有临床影响潜力。数据集、模型和评估套件已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

TL;DR: DATE方法通过时间戳注入和语义引导采样策略，显著提升了MLLMs在长视频理解中的时间感知能力，7B模型性能超越部分72B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中存在长距离依赖问题，导致关键信息丢失和时间理解能力下降。为了解决这些问题，提出了DATE方法。

Method: 通过时间戳注入机制（TIM）构建连续的时间参考系统，并结合两阶段算法（描述性标题生成和相似性驱动的时间正则化贪婪策略）进行视频采样，确保语义相关性和时间覆盖。

Result: DATE方法在长时间视频基准测试中表现出色，7B模型甚至在某些基准测试中超越了许多72B模型。

Conclusion: 提出的DATE方法通过时间戳注入机制（TIM）和语义引导的时间感知相似性采样策略（TASS），显著提升了MLLMs在长视频理解中的时间感知能力，并在长时间视频基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有高效分割模型多为静态设计，难以适应多样化任务且难以平衡性能与资源效率，限制了临床环境中的快速部署。

Method: PSP-Seg采用渐进式剪枝框架，结合块级剪枝和功能解耦损失，从冗余模型开始逐步剪枝冗余模块。

Result: PSP-Seg-S在性能与nnU-Net相当的情况下，GPU内存使用减少42-45%，训练时间缩短29-48%，参数数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg框架通过动态剪枝和功能解耦损失，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了资源消耗，为临床3D医学图像分割提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种改进的U-net架构，通过整合模态无关和模态特定的输入通道，能够处理训练中未见过的MRI模态，同时保持对已见过模态的有效分割能力。

Motivation: 现有的多模态脑MRI分割模型大多局限于固定模态，无法在推理时有效处理新模态。有些模型虽然能泛化到未见过的模态，但可能丢失模态特定的判别信息。本研究旨在开发一个能够处理任何可用成像模态的模型。

Method: 研究开发了一种图像增强方案，通过合成人工MRI模态来训练模态无关组件。增强方案通过差异性地改变病理和健康脑组织的表现来创建人工对比，同时保持真实的解剖完整性。

Result: 该方法在包含5种病理类型和8种模态的8个MRI数据库上进行了评估，结果显示该方法既能有效处理训练中见过的MRI模态，也能处理新的未见过的模态以改进分割。

Conclusion: 该研究通过整合模态无关的输入通道和模态特定的输入通道，提出了一种简单实用的U-net架构改进，能够处理训练中未见过的模态、已见过的模态以及两者的异质组合。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：依赖外部工具导致脆弱性，或使用单一推理策略（如文本链式思维）难以验证中间步骤。这限制了强化学习信号的利用，无法有效奖励事实准确性。

Method: 提出Code-as-Thought（CaT）方法，将图表视觉信息转化为可验证的符号格式，并结合直接视觉推理路径。通过强化学习训练模型的选择策略，采用双奖励系统（数据准确性奖励和决策奖励）来优化模型行为。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Motivation: To address the underexplored capacity of MLLMs in understanding real-world materials characterization imaging data, despite their promise in generative and predictive tasks within materials science.

Method: The study introduces MatCha, a benchmark comprising 1,500 questions across 21 tasks, reflecting real challenges in materials research. State-of-the-art MLLMs were evaluated on MatCha.

Result: Evaluation revealed a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human experts, with models struggling on higher-level expertise and sophisticated visual perception tasks. Few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting failed to bridge this gap.

Conclusion: MatCha serves as a benchmark to highlight the limitations of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in understanding real-world materials characterization imaging data, aiming to spur future research in material discovery and autonomous scientific agents.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一种无需掩码注释的SAR图像目标解耦框架，通过多级特征集成提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的目标常被复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）干扰，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表示的清晰性。

Method: SlotSAR首先从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征，并从小波散射网络中提取低级散射特征，以获得互补的多级表示。然后通过多级槽注意力模块集成这些特征，增强槽级表示的独特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SlotSAR在SAR图像分类中表现优于现有OCL方法，保留了更多结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR提出了一种新颖的面向对象学习框架，有效解耦了SAR图像中的目标表示与背景杂波，无需掩码注释即可实现，且在SAR图像分类中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from

Conclusion: PHCP框架通过推理时的自训练适配器动态对齐特征，无需联合训练或标记数据，在多样化的异构场景中表现出色，性能接近全数据集训练的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional

improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Abstract: Generative AI evolves the execution of complex workflows in industry, where
the large multimodal model empowers fashion design in the garment industry.
Current generation AI models magically transform brainstorming into fancy
designs easily, but the fine-grained customization still suffers from text
uncertainty without professional background knowledge from end-users. Thus, we
propose the Better Understanding Generation (BUG) workflow with LMM to
automatically create and fine-grain customize the cloth designs from chat with
image-into-prompt. Our framework unleashes users' creative potential beyond
words and also lowers the barriers of clothing design/editing without further
human involvement. To prove the effectiveness of our model, we propose a new
FashionEdit dataset that simulates the real-world clothing design workflow,
evaluated from generation similarity, user satisfaction, and quality. The code

TL;DR: 研究发现，领域相关的小数据集在小样本手术技能评估中优于大规模但不匹配的数据集，且结合手术特定数据的预训练能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手术技能注释的稀缺性和标注所需的高成本，开发鲁棒的SSA模型具有挑战性。小样本学习（FSL）提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，但其成功依赖于有效的预训练。尽管预训练在多个外科下游任务中被广泛研究，但在SSA中仍未被充分探索。

Method: 本研究将SSA任务形式化为小样本学习问题，并评估了不同自监督预训练策略对小样本SSA性能的影响。通过标注公开的机器人手术数据集，并在三种小样本设置下进行测试，量化了领域相似性及其对模型迁移能力的影响。

Result: 在1-shot、2-shot和5-shot设置下，领域相关的小规模数据集分别达到了60.16%、66.03%和73.65%的准确率。将手术特定数据与领域相关外部数据集结合预训练，平均准确率提升了1.22%，F1分数提升了2.28%。

Conclusion: 在小样本设置下，领域相关的小规模数据集在手术技能评估（SSA）任务中表现优于大规模但领域不匹配的数据集。此外，将手术特定数据与领域相关的外部数据集结合预训练可以显著提升性能，但若使用领域不匹配的大规模数据则可能导致性能下降。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合数学模型和深度学习的方法，能够在数据有限的情况下生成生物信息学上合理的脑肿瘤未来MRI图像，为临床决策提供支持。

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 本文通过将PnP方法与DDIM结合，提出了一种统一框架，有效整合了学习先验与物理前向模型，实验结果表明该方法在单像素成像任务中取得了更好的重建质量。

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种全自动两阶段框架，通过整合ONSD测量和临床数据，显著提高了ICP评估的准确性和可靠性，为非侵入性ICP监测提供了创新解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内压（ICP）升高对脑功能构成严重威胁，需要监测以进行及时干预。腰椎穿刺是ICP测量的金标准，但其侵入性和相关风险推动了对非侵入性替代方案的需求。视神经鞘直径（ONSD）作为有前景的生物标志物，其测量目前存在手动操作不一致、主观性等问题。

Method: 论文介绍了一个全自动两阶段框架，包括关键帧识别、ONSD测量和临床数据整合。第一阶段通过眼底超声视频处理进行帧级解剖分割、基于规则的关键帧识别和精确ONSD测量；第二阶段融合ONSD指标与临床特征预测ICP等级。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在验证集上的准确率为$0.845 \pm 0.071$（五折交叉验证标准差），独立测试集准确率为0.786，显著优于传统阈值方法（验证准确率$0.637 \pm 0.111$，测试准确率0.429）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的全自动两阶段框架通过减少操作者变异性和整合多源信息，为临床ICP评估建立了可靠的非侵入性方法，有望改善急性神经疾病患者的管理。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部正常集支持的无监督IC缺陷分割框架，通过提取正常特征并重构正常内容，利用重建残差分割缺陷，实验显示优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代集成电路制造中多样且细粒度的缺陷降低了产量和可靠性。现有工业缺陷分割方法通常需要外部正常集支持，这在IC图像中因布局变化和准确对齐困难而显得脆弱。观察到缺陷主要是局部的，而每幅图像仍包含丰富的可重复正常模式。

Method: 框架包括一个可学习的正常信息提取器，用于从测试图像中聚合代表性正常特征，并通过一致性损失强制这些特征与正常区域关联。解码器根据这些特征重构正常内容，重建残差用于分割缺陷。伪异常增强进一步稳定训练。

Result: 在三个IC工艺阶段的数据集上，该方法相比现有方法表现出一致的改进，并对产品变异性具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的无监督IC缺陷分割框架在三个IC工艺阶段的数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能，并对产品变异性具有强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Conclusion: DRiFt框架通过解耦临床相关特征与任务无关噪声，显著提升了医学视觉语言模型在分布变化下的可靠性和泛化能力，为临床使用提供了更安全、更可信的模型。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Conclusion: 通过引入基于动量的约束损失，该方法有效减少了脚部滑动和抖动，提高了运动平衡性，并保持了运动恢复的准确性。

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Motivation: 多视图聚类（MVC）在深度学习的推动下取得进展，但多视图融合中存在低质量数据问题，包括噪声数据和数据缺失。

Method: 提出了一种随机生成扩散融合（SGDF）方法，利用多生成机制处理多视图特征，并进一步构建了生成扩散对比网络（GDCN）。

Result: GDCN在深度MVC任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SGDF方法通过多生成机制和生成扩散对比网络（GDCN）有效解决了多视图聚类中的低质量数据问题，并在实验中取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: DualTrack是一种新型双编码器架构，通过解耦局部和全局特征提取，显著提升3D超声重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，而现有传感器less 3D超声方法未能有效解耦局部和全局特征提取，限制了鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DualTrack，一种双编码器架构，分别利用局部编码器（密集时空卷积）和全局编码器（图像主干和时序注意力层）提取特征，并通过轻量级融合模块结合。

Result: 在大型公开基准测试中，DualTrack实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的3D重建，平均误差低于5毫米。

Conclusion: DualTrack通过解耦的局部和全局编码器架构，显著提升了3D超声重建的准确性和全局一致性，平均重建误差低于5毫米。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: PeftCD 是一个基于视觉基础模型的高效变化检测框架，通过参数高效微调和轻量级设计，在多数据集上实现了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多时相、多源遥感影像中伪变化普遍、标记样本稀缺以及跨域泛化困难的问题。

Method: PeftCD 基于视觉基础模型（VFMs）构建，采用参数高效微调（PEFT）技术，核心是一个权重共享的 Siamese 编码器，集成了 LoRA 和 Adapter 模块，并配以轻量级解码器。

Result: PeftCD 在多个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，包括 SYSU-CD（IoU 73.81%）、WHUCD（92.05%）、MSRSCD（64.07%）、MLCD（76.89%）、CDD（97.01%）、S2Looking（52.25%）和 LEVIR-CD（85.62%），具有精确的边界划分和强伪变化抑制能力。

Conclusion: PeftCD 在精度、效率和泛化能力之间实现了最佳平衡，为大规模视觉基础模型（VFMs）在实际遥感变化检测应用中的适配提供了强大且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar 通过两阶段框架统一多模态指令理解与逼真肖像生成，显著提升了音频驱动虚拟形象的叙事连贯性和表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将指令条件视为由声学或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，未建模指令传达的交流目的，导致叙事连贯性和角色表现力不足。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段设计多模态大语言模型（MLLM）导演，生成基于多样化指令信号的蓝图视频；第二阶段通过首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段，保留细节并编码高层意图。

Result: Kling-Avatar 能够生成生动、流畅、长时间的高清视频（1080p、48 fps），在唇同步精度、情感表达、指令可控性等方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar 通过统一多模态指令理解与逼真肖像生成，显著提升了音频驱动虚拟形象的叙事连贯性和表现力，成为语义基础、高保真音频驱动合成的新的基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉现象在现实应用中存在重大风险，现有基准测试主要测试识别准确性，忽略了同样关键的认知谦逊行为。

Method: 利用全景场景图数据集的细粒度场景图注释提取真实实体和关系，并利用GPT-4-Turbo生成多项选择题，随后进行严格的手动过滤过程。

Result: 评估了多种先进MLLMs在HumbleBench上的表现，并分享了有价值的发现和见解。

Conclusion: HumbleBench填补了当前评估套件中的关键空白，提供了一个更真实的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在安全关键场景下的可靠性衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

<details>

Motivation: 通过统一的训练目标，促进图像与文本之间的双向信息流动，实现理解与生成的相互增益。

Method: 提出UAE框架，预训练解码器并采用Unified-GRPO强化学习，分三阶段训练编码器和解码器。

Result: 编码器生成更具描述性的文本，解码器能理解复杂描述并生成高保真重建图像。

Conclusion: 通过UAE框架和Unified-GRPO强化学习，实现了图像与文本的双向理解与生成，显著提升了多模态学习的统一性和重建质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Conclusion: NRMF 作为一种新颖的3D生成人类运动先验，能够实现鲁棒、时间一致且物理上合理的3D运动恢复，展示了在多种任务和输入模态上的显著泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Motivation: 扩散模型因其训练目标存在闭式最优解（即最优去噪器）而独特。然而，使用最优去噪器的扩散模型仅能复现训练集中的图像，无法捕捉深度扩散模型的行为。本文旨在探究深度扩散模型与最优去噪器之间性能差距的根源。

Method: 我们首先展示了一个最优参数线性去噪器与深度神经去噪器具有相似的局部性特性。随后，通过理论和实验证明这种局部性直接源于自然图像数据集中的像素相关性。最后，利用这些见解设计了一个新的分析性去噪器。

Result: 研究发现，深度扩散模型的局部性是自然图像数据集的统计属性，而非卷积神经网络的归纳偏置。基于此设计的新分析性去噪器在预测分数上优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论和实验证明，深度扩散模型中的局部性源于自然图像数据集的像素相关性，而非卷积神经网络的归纳偏置。基于这一发现，我们设计了一个分析性去噪器，其预测分数比先前专家设计的替代方案更接近深度扩散模型。

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured

statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality

descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to

of computational research. The Python glob module provides a simple yet
powerful way to search, filter, and ingest files using wildcard patterns,
enabling scalable workflows across disciplines. This paper introduces glob as a

facilitates efficient file traversal and integration with analytical pipelines.
By situating glob within the broader context of reproducible research and data
engineering, we highlight its role as a methodological building block. Our goal
is to provide researchers and practitioners with a concise reference that
bridges foundational concepts and applied practice, making glob a default

TL;DR: GeoJSON Agents是一种多智能体LLM框架，通过Function Calling和Code Generation技术处理空间数据，显著提升了GIS自动化任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在任务自动化和自然语言理解方面取得了显著进展，但在缺乏GIS专业知识的情况下仍存在局限性。为解决这些问题，提出了GeoJSON Agents。

Method: 该框架采用多智能体LLM架构，包括任务解析、智能体协作和结果集成三个组件，通过Function Calling和Code Generation两种技术处理空间数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于Function Calling的GeoJSON Agent准确率为85.71%，基于Code Generation的Agent准确率为97.14%，均显著优于通用模型（48.57%）。

Conclusion: 本研究首次提出了针对GeoJSON数据的LLM多智能体框架，并比较了两种主流LLM增强方法的优劣，为提升GeoAI系统性能提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs have made substantial progress in task automation and natural language
understanding.However,without expertise in GIS,they continue to encounter
limitations.To address these issues, we propose GeoJSON Agents-a multi-agent
LLM architecture.This framework transforms natural language tasks into
structured GeoJSON operation commands and processes spatial data using two
widely adopted LLM enhancement techniques:Function Calling and Code
Generation.The architecture consists of three components-task parsing,agent
collaboration,and result integration-aimed at enhancing both the performance
and scalability of GIS automation.The Planner agent interprets natural language
tasks into structured GeoJSON commands.Then,specialized Worker agents
collaborate according to assigned roles to perform spatial data processing and
analysis,either by invoking predefined function APIs or by dynamically
generating and executing Python-based spatial analysis code.Finally,the system
integrates the outputs from multiple execution rounds into
reusable,standards-compliant GeoJSON files.To systematically evaluate the
performance of the two approaches,we constructed a benchmark dataset of 70
tasks with varying complexity and conducted experiments using OpenAI's GPT-4o
as the core model.Results indicate that the Function Calling-based GeoJSON
Agent achieved an accuracy of 85.71%,while the Code Generation-based agent
reached 97.14%,both significantly outperforming the best-performing
general-purpose model (48.57%).Further analysis reveals that the Code
Generation provides greater flexibility,whereas the Function Calling approach
offers more stable execution.This study is the first to introduce an LLM
multi-agent framework for GeoJSON data and to compare the strengths and
limitations of two mainstream LLM enhancement methods,offering new perspectives
for improving GeoAI system performance.

*Guangyu Zhang,Xixuan Wang,Shiyu Sun,Peiyan Xiao,Kun Sun,Yanhai Xiong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TraceRAG是一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的框架，通过自然语言查询和代码分析实现可解释的Android恶意软件检测，实验证明其高准确率和报告实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意Android应用使用复杂的规避策略和语义行为隐藏恶意逻辑，传统分析技术难以深入挖掘隐藏行为或提供可解释的决策依据，因此需要一种更强大的分析框架。

Method: TraceRAG采用检索增强生成（RAG）框架，首先生成方法级代码片段的摘要并索引到向量数据库中，然后通过行为聚焦的问题检索最相关的代码片段进行深入分析，最终生成包含恶意行为及其代码实现的可读报告。

Result: 实验结果显示，TraceRAG在恶意软件检测准确率达到96%，行为识别准确率为83.81%，且专家评估确认其生成报告的实用性。

Conclusion: TraceRAG框架通过结合自然语言查询和Java代码，提供了可解释的恶意软件检测与分析，实验结果显示其在恶意软件检测和行为识别方面具有高准确率，且生成的报告具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Sophisticated evasion tactics in malicious Android applications, combined
with their intricate behavioral semantics, enable attackers to conceal
malicious logic within legitimate functions, underscoring the critical need for
robust and in-depth analysis frameworks. However, traditional analysis
techniques often fail to recover deeply hidden behaviors or provide
human-readable justifications for their decisions. Inspired by advances in
large language models (LLMs), we introduce TraceRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that bridges natural language queries and Java code
to deliver explainable malware detection and analysis. First, TraceRAG
generates summaries of method-level code snippets, which are indexed in a
vector database. At query time, behavior-focused questions retrieve the most
semantically relevant snippets for deeper inspection. Finally, based on the
multi-turn analysis results, TraceRAG produces human-readable reports that
present the identified malicious behaviors and their corresponding code
implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 96\%
malware detection accuracy and 83.81\% behavior identification accuracy based
on updated VirusTotal (VT) scans and manual verification. Furthermore, expert
evaluation confirms the practical utility of the reports generated by TraceRAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的普及对气候产生了日益增长的影响，因其部署和使用需要大量能源。为了提升开发者的意识，需要更多关于LLM能效的信息。现有研究虽评估了多种模型的能效，但这些基准测试往往无法代表真实生产场景。

Method: 我们引入了LLM Efficiency Benchmark，利用vLLM（一种高吞吐量、生产就绪的LLM服务后端）来模拟真实使用场景。

Result: 我们的研究展示了模型大小、架构和并发请求量等因素如何影响推理能效。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可以设计出更贴近实际部署条件的能效基准测试，为开发者构建更可持续的AI系统提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is having an growing impact on
the climate due to the substantial energy required for their deployment and
use. To create awareness for developers who are implementing LLMs in their
products, there is a strong need to collect more information about the energy
efficiency of LLMs. While existing research has evaluated the energy efficiency
of various models, these benchmarks often fall short of representing realistic
production scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the LLM Efficiency Benchmark,
designed to simulate real-world usage conditions. Our benchmark utilizes vLLM,
a high-throughput, production-ready LLM serving backend that optimizes model
performance and efficiency. We examine how factors such as model size,
architecture, and concurrent request volume affect inference energy efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to create energy efficiency
benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment conditions, providing
valuable insights for developers aiming to build more sustainable AI systems.

*Doha Nam,Taehyoun Kim,Duksan Ryu,Jongmoon Baik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReDef是一个高质量的函数级修改数据集，通过微调和测试PLMs发现，尽管diff编码表现优异，但模型对代码修改的理解仍依赖表面线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有JIT-SDP数据集中标签噪声和低精度问题，提供更可靠的基准数据集。

Method: 通过微调CodeBERT、CodeT5+和UniXcoder，并采用五种输入编码策略，进一步通过反事实扰动测试模型的敏感性。

Result: 紧凑的diff风格编码在所有PLMs中始终优于全函数格式，但反事实测试显示模型依赖表面线索而非真正的语义理解。

Conclusion: 当前预训练语言模型（PLMs）在理解代码修改方面的能力仍然有限，尤其是在捕获真正的编辑语义上。

Abstract: Just-in-Time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) plays a critical role in
prioritizing risky code changes during code review and continuous integration.
However, existing datasets often suffer from noisy labels and low precision in
identifying bug-inducing commits. To address this, we present ReDef
(Revert-based Defect dataset), a high-confidence benchmark of function-level
modifications curated from 22 large-scale C/C++ projects. Defective cases are
anchored by revert commits, while clean cases are validated through post-hoc
history checks. Ambiguous instances are conservatively filtered out via a
GPT-assisted triage process involving multiple votes and audits. This pipeline
yields 3,164 defective and 10,268 clean modifications, offering substantially
more reliable labels than prior existing resources. Beyond dataset
construction, we provide the first systematic evaluation of how pre-trained
language models (PLMs) reason about code modifications -- specifically, which
input encodings most effectively expose change information, and whether models
genuinely capture edit semantics. We fine-tune CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder
under five encoding strategies, and further probe their sensitivity through
counterfactual perturbations that swap added/deleted blocks, invert diff
polarity, or inject spurious markers. Our results show that compact diff-style
encodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs, with
statistical tests confirming large, model-independent effects. However, under
counterfactual tests, performance degrades little or not at all -- revealing
that what appears to be robustness in fact reflects reliance on superficial
cues rather than true semantic understanding. These findings indicate that,
unlike in snapshot-based tasks, current PLMs remain limited in their ability to
genuinely comprehend code modifications.

*Ayelet Berzack,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs在软件开发中虽有优势但易出错。本文提出结合LLMs与SBP的方法，通过案例研究验证其有效性，能减少错误并验证程序正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在软件开发中具有显著优势，但它们常引入严重错误且自信地呈现错误代码，误导开发者接受有缺陷的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种将LLMs与传统的软件工程技术（特别是基于场景的编程范式SBP）结合的结构化方法。

Result: 通过案例研究（设计并实现Connect4游戏），我们展示了该方法能有效减少错误并验证关键程序属性。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLMs和SBP，我们能够创建一个高度智能的代理，并在某些情况下形式化验证其正确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for
software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex
programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce
development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and
occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on
their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce
significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,
potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.
  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable
manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''
software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of
streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to
verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we
focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,
scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers
to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify
its outputs.
  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used
it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were
able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong
existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the
correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights
regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our
case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this
paper.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文首次大规模调查了公共代码仓库中的Git历史修改行为，发现1.22百万个仓库存在8.7百万次历史重写，并开发了GitHistorian工具以帮助识别此类修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Git等版本控制系统允许开发者修改本地历史记录，但公共分支上的此类修改可能破坏工作流程、挑战仓库的完整性和可重现性，并为供应链攻击提供机会。

Method: 研究分析了来自Software Heritage存档的1.11亿个代码仓库，识别出1.22百万个存在历史修改的仓库，总计8.7百万次历史重写。通过两类针对性案例研究，分析了历史修改的类型和影响。

Result: 研究发现历史修改常涉及许可证的追溯性变更或敏感信息的删除，这些行为可能反映不良的项目治理或安全管理实践。

Conclusion: 论文提出了GitHistorian这一自动化工具，帮助开发者发现并描述公共Git仓库中的历史修改行为，以应对因历史修改引发的项目治理和安全管理问题。

Abstract: Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git allow developers to locally rewrite
recorded history, e.g., to reorder and suppress commits or specific data in
them. These alterations have legitimate use cases, but become problematic when
performed on public branches that have downstream users: they break push/pull
workflows, challenge the integrity and reproducibility of repositories, and
create opportunities for supply chain attackers to sneak into them nefarious
changes. We conduct the first large-scale investigation of Git history
alterations in public code repositories. We analyze 111 M (millions)
repositories archived by Software Heritage, which preserves VCS histories even
across alterations. We find history alterations in 1.22 M repositories, for a
total of 8.7 M rewritten histories. We categorize changes by where they happen
(which repositories, which branches) and what is changed in them (files or
commit metadata). Conducting two targeted case studies we show that altered
histories recurrently change licenses retroactively, or are used to remove
''secrets'' (e.g., private keys) committed by mistake. As these behaviors
correspond to bad practices-in terms of project governance or security
management, respectively-that software recipients might want to avoid, we
introduce GitHistorian, an automated tool, that developers can use to spot and
describe history alterations in public Git repositories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习漏洞检测技术在工业应用中的可访问性和适用性问题，包括信任度、遗留系统、数字素养差距及学术与工业专业知识之间的鸿沟。

Method: 使用CodeBERT检测工业和开源软件中的漏洞函数，分析其跨领域泛化能力，并开发了AI-DO系统，该系统集成了微调的CodeBERT，用于代码审查期间的漏洞检测和定位。

Result: 工业数据训练的模型在同一领域内准确检测漏洞，但在开源代码上性能下降；基于开源数据微调的深度学习模型结合下采样技术能改进漏洞检测。

Conclusion: AI-DO作为一个集成到CI/CD流程中的推荐系统，能够在不中断工作流程的情况下检测和定位漏洞，且通过适当的下采样技术，基于开源数据微调的深度学习模型能提升漏洞检测效果。

Abstract: Deep learning solutions for vulnerability detection proposed in academic
research are not always accessible to developers, and their applicability in
industrial settings is rarely addressed. Transferring such technologies from
academia to industry presents challenges related to trustworthiness, legacy
systems, limited digital literacy, and the gap between academic and industrial
expertise. For deep learning in particular, performance and integration into
existing workflows are additional concerns. In this work, we first evaluate the
performance of CodeBERT for detecting vulnerable functions in industrial and
open-source software. We analyse its cross-domain generalisation when
fine-tuned on open-source data and tested on industrial data, and vice versa,
also exploring strategies for handling class imbalance. Based on these results,
we develop AI-DO(Automating vulnerability detection Integration for Developers'
Operations), a Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)-integrated
recommender system that uses fine-tuned CodeBERT to detect and localise
vulnerabilities during code review without disrupting workflows. Finally, we
assess the tool's perceived usefulness through a survey with the company's IT
professionals. Our results show that models trained on industrial data detect
vulnerabilities accurately within the same domain but lose performance on
open-source code, while a deep learner fine-tuned on open data, with
appropriate undersampling techniques, improves the detection of
vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发中，容器化环境的使用带来了安全风险，特别是当生产环境中无意包含过时或易受攻击的组件时。SCA工具在面对模糊容器时的局限性促使了这项研究。

Method: 提出了一种模糊容器的分析方法，并开发了ORCA工具。

Result: 分析了600个流行容器，发现模糊容器存在于知名注册表和受信任的镜像中，许多工具无法分析此类容器。ORCA在文件覆盖率上实现了显著提升。

Conclusion: ORCA（Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer）作为一种开源实现，能够有效检测模糊容器的内容，并在文件覆盖率上相比Docker Scout和Syft实现了中位数40%的提升。

Abstract: Modern software development increasingly depends on open-source libraries and
third-party components, which are often encapsulated into containerized
environments. While improving the development and deployment of applications,
this approach introduces security risks, particularly when outdated or
vulnerable components are inadvertently included in production environments.
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical process that helps identify
and manage packages and dependencies inside a container. However, unintentional
modifications to the container filesystem can lead to incomplete container
images, which compromise the reliability of SCA tools. In this paper, we
examine the limitations of both cloud-based and open-source SCA tools when
faced with such obscure images. An analysis of 600 popular containers revealed
that obscure containers exist in well-known registries and trusted images and
that many tools fail to analyze such containers. To mitigate these issues, we
propose an obscuration-resilient methodology for container analysis and
introduce ORCA (Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer), its open-source
implementation. We reported our findings to all vendors using their appropriate
channels. Our results demonstrate that ORCA effectively detects the content of
obscure containers and achieves a median 40% improvement in file coverage
compared to Docker Scout and Syft.

Motivation: 长上下文语言模型的出现为复杂的代码理解和软件开发评估提供了新机会，但现有基准主要关注单函数完成或短上下文任务，缺乏对长上下文能力的评估。

Method: 通过5阶段流程生成多样化的高质量评估场景，涵盖8个任务类别，并引入包含17个指标的综合评估框架，包括8个新指标，合并为LoCoBench Score (LCBS)。

Result: LoCoBench为10种编程语言生成了8,000个评估场景，上下文长度从10K到1M令牌不等，评估显示当前模型在长上下文理解能力上存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LoCoBench填补了长上下文LLMs在复杂软件开发场景中的评估空白，并揭示了当前最先进模型在长上下文理解能力上的显著不足，强调了这一领域需要更多关注。

Abstract: The emergence of long-context language models with context windows extending
to millions of tokens has created new opportunities for sophisticated code
understanding and software development evaluation. We propose LoCoBench, a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in
realistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code
evaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context
tasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context
capabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across
multiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale
software systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios
systematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths
spanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of
long-context performance degradation in realistic software development
settings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential
long-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,
multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code
comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase
pipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to
reason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,
including 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial
performance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex
software development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands
more attention. LoCoBench is released at:

TL;DR: SmartDetector 通过分解 AST 为语句树并优化分类器超参数，显著提升了智能合约函数相似性检测的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约开发中广泛复用开源代码导致缺陷传播加剧，而现有方法（如基于 AST 或深度学习的方法）在语义比较和可解释性上存在不足。

Method: SmartDetector 将智能合约函数的 AST 分解为较小的语句树，并通过分类器计算每对语句树的相似性得分。此外，采用余弦扩散过程高效搜索最优超参数。

Result: 在三个大型真实数据集上的实验表明，SmartDetector 的平均 F1 分数为 95.88%，优于现有方法 14.01%。

Conclusion: SmartDetector 在检测智能合约函数相似性方面表现出色，平均 F1 分数达到 95.88%，比现有方法提升了 14.01%。

Abstract: Widespread reuse of open-source code in smart contract development boosts
programming efficiency but significantly amplifies bug propagation across
contracts, while dedicated methods for detecting similar smart contract
functions remain very limited. Conventional abstract-syntax-tree (AST) based
methods for smart contract similarity detection face challenges in handling
intricate tree structures, which impedes detailed semantic comparison of code.
Recent deep-learning based approaches tend to overlook code syntax and
detection interpretability, resulting in suboptimal performance.
  To fill this research gap, we introduce SmartDetector, a novel approach for
computing similarity between smart contract functions, explainable at the
fine-grained statement level. Technically, SmartDetector decomposes the AST of
a smart contract function into a series of smaller statement trees, each
reflecting a structural element of the source code. Then, SmartDetector uses a
classifier to compute the similarity score of two functions by comparing each
pair of their statement trees. To address the infinite hyperparameter space of
the classifier, we mathematically derive a cosine-wise diffusion process to
efficiently search optimal hyperparameters. Extensive experiments conducted on
three large real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartDetector outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods by an average improvement of 14.01% in
F1-score, achieving an overall average F1-score of 95.88%.

TL;DR: dMAP是一个远程测量框架，通过行为指纹识别DPI设备，有效区分全球范围内的不同实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPI设备的普及使得网络干扰（如审查、限速和拦截）日益严重，但现有工具难以测量这些中间设备，DPI厂商的隐蔽行为进一步增加了测量难度。

Method: 基于差分模糊测试，dMAP系统地发现、选择并部署专门设计的探针，将DPI的内部解析行为转化为可观测的外部指纹。

Result: dMAP使用20-40个探针即可可靠区分多种DPI实现，包括国家级审查设施和商业DPI产品。

Conclusion: dMAP通过行为指纹识别技术，成功区分和聚类了全球范围内的DPI部署，为对抗网络干扰提供了新的测量工具。

Abstract: Users around the world face escalating network interference such as
censorship, throttling, and interception, largely driven by the commoditization
and growing availability of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) devices. Once reserved
for a few well-resourced nation-state actors, the ability to interfere with
traffic at scale is now within reach of nearly any network operator. Despite
this proliferation, our understanding of DPIs and their deployments on the
Internet remains limited -- being network intermediary leaves DPI unresponsive
to conventional host-based scanning tools, and DPI vendors actively obscuring
their products further complicates measurement efforts.
  In this work, we present a remote measurement framework, dMAP (DPI Mapper),
that derives behavioral fingerprints for DPIs to differentiate and cluster
these otherwise indistinguishable middleboxes at scale, as a first step toward
active reconnaissance of DPIs on the Internet. Our key insight is that parsing
and interpreting traffic as network intermediaries inherently involves
ambiguities -- from under-specified protocol behaviors to differing RFC
interpretations -- forcing DPI vendors into independent implementation choices
that create measurable variance among DPIs. Based on differential fuzzing, dMAP
systematically discovers, selects, and deploys specialized probes that
translate DPI internal parsing behaviors into externally observable
fingerprints. Applying dMAP to DPI deployments globally, we demonstrate its
practical feasibility, showing that even a modest set of 20-40 discriminative
probes reliably differentiates a wide range of DPI implementations, including
major nation-state censorship infrastructures and commercial DPI products. We
discuss how our fingerprinting methodology generalizes beyond censorship to
other forms of targeted interference.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques play a pivotal role in optimizing
wireless communication networks. However, traditional deep learning approaches
often act as closed boxes, lacking the structured reasoning abilities needed to
tackle complex, multi-step decision problems. This survey provides a
comprehensive review and outlook of reasoning-enabled AI in wireless
communication networks, with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and other
advanced reasoning paradigms. In particular, LLM-based agents can combine
reasoning with long-term planning, memory, tool utilization, and autonomous
cross-layer control to dynamically optimize network operations with minimal
human intervention. We begin by outlining the evolution of intelligent wireless
networking and the limitations of conventional AI methods. We then introduce
emerging AI reasoning techniques. Furthermore, we establish a classification
system applicable to wireless network tasks. We also present a layer-by-layer
examination for AI reasoning, covering the physical, data link, network,
transport, and application layers. For each part, we identify key challenges
and illustrate how AI reasoning methods can improve AI-based wireless
communication performance. Finally, we discuss key research directions for AI
reasoning toward future wireless communication networks. By combining insights
from both communications and AI, this survey aims to chart a path for
integrating reasoning techniques into the next-generation wireless networks.

### [94] [Joint Optimisation of Load Balancing and Energy Efficiency for O-RAN Deployments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09343)

TL;DR: 论文提出ML框架，联合优化O-RAN的负载平衡和EE，随机森林模型表现优异，F1-macro达98.3%，比传统方法提升195%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI/ML方法依赖卸载用户设备（UE）以实现动态睡眠，导致网络负载不平衡并可能影响UE的吞吐性能。论文旨在解决这一问题，同时优化EE。

Method: 采用多类分类系统，预测性评估潜在的RU配置，并通过多阈值方法（保守、中等、激进）优化EE，同时将网络条件映射到三个负载平衡类别（良好平衡、中等平衡、不平衡）。

Result: 实验评估显示，随机森林模型在4.26百万条真实网络测量数据中实现了98.3%的F1-macro性能，相比传统基线策略提升了195%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个基于机器学习的综合框架，用于在O-RAN部署中联合优化负载平衡和能源效率（EE），并通过实验验证了其随机森林模型的高效性，F1-macro性能达到98.3%，显著优于传统基线策略。

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture provides an intrinsic
capability to exploit key performance monitoring (KPM) within Radio
Intelligence Controller (RIC) to derive network optimisation through xApps.
These xApps can leverage KPM knowledge to dynamically switch on/off the
associated RUs where such a function is supported over the E2 interface.
Several existing studies employ artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning
(ML) based approaches to realise such dynamic sleeping for increased energy
efficiency (EE). Nevertheless, most of these approaches rely upon offloading
user equipment (UE) to carve out a sleeping opportunity. Such an approach
inherently creates load imbalance across the network. Such load imbalance may
impact the throughput performance of offloaded UEs as they might be allocated a
lower number of physical resource blocks (PRBs). Maintaining the same PRB
allocation while addressing the EE at the network level is a challenging task.
To that end, in this article, we present a comprehensive ML-based framework for
joint optimisation of load balancing and EE for ORAN deployments. We formulate
the problem as a multi-class classification system that predictively evaluates
potential RU configurations before optimising the EE, mapping network
conditions to three load balance categories (Well Balanced, Moderately
Balanced, Imbalanced). Our multi-threshold approach (Conservative, Moderate,
Aggressive) accommodates different operational priorities between energy
savings and performance assurance. Experimental evaluation using 4.26 million
real network measurements from simulations demonstrates that our Random Forest
model achieves 98.3% F1-macro performance, representing 195% improvement over
traditional baseline strategies.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，通信网络面临日益增长的安全威胁，QKD网络的可扩展性和长距离实现仍是挑战。

Method: 通过在每个节点中建立高级虚拟KMS（vKMS）和称为量子安全控制器（QuSeC）的新实体，实现了端到端中继路径的计算和安全策略的应用。

Result: 提出的架构通过vKMS和QuSeC实现了高效的密钥管理和中继路径发现，并进行了安全分析，验证了其核心网络安全特性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种创新的网络架构，通过整合软件定义网络（SDN）原则，解决了量子密钥分发（QKD）网络中的密钥管理系统（KMS）识别、中继路径发现和可扩展性挑战。

Abstract: With the advent of quantum computing, the increasing threats to security
poses a great challenge to communication networks. Recent innovations in this
field resulted in promising technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD), which enables the generation of unconditionally secure keys,
establishing secure communications between remote nodes. Additionally, QKD
networks enable the interconnection of multinode architectures, extending the
point-to-point nature of QKD. However, due to the limitations of the current
state of technology, the scalability of QKD networks remains a challenge toward
feasible implementations. When it comes to long-distance implementations,
trusted relay nodes partially solve the distance issue through the forwarding
of the distributed keys, allowing applications that do not have a direct QKD
link to securely share key material. Even though the relay procedure itself has
been extensively studied, the establishment of the relaying node path still
lacks a solution. This paper proposes an innovative network architecture that
solves the challenges of Key Management System (KMS) identification, relay path
discovery, and scalability of QKD networks by integrating Software-Defined
Networking (SDN) principles, and establishing high-level virtual KMSs (vKMS) in
each node and creating a new entity called the Quantum Security Controller
(QuSeC). The vKMS serves the end-user key requests, managing the multiple KMSs
within the node and abstracting the user from discovering the correct KMS.
Additionally, based on the high-level view of the network topology and status,
the QuSeC serves the path discovery requests from vKMSs, computing the
end-to-end (E2E) relay path and applying security policies. The paper also
provides a security analysis of the proposal, identifying the security levels
of the architecture and analyzing the core networking security properties.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of mobile security protocols and limited availability of
current datasets constrains research in app traffic analysis. This paper
presents PARROT, a reproducible and portable traffic capture system for
systematic app traffic collection using Android Virtual Devices. The system
provides automated environment setup, configurable Android versions, traffic
recording management, and labeled captures extraction with human-in-the-loop
app interaction. PARROT integrates mitmproxy for optional traffic decryption
with automated SSL/TLS key extraction, supporting flexible capture modes with

TLSv1.3 protocol, with TLSv1.3 comprising 90.0\% of TCP encrypted traffic in
2025 compared to 6.7\% in 2021. QUIC protocol adoption increased substantially,
with all 50 common apps generating QUIC traffic under normal network conditions
compared to 30 apps in 2021. DNS communications evolved from predominantly
unencrypted Do53 protocol (91.0\% in 2021) to encrypted DoT protocol (81.1\% in
2025). The open-source PARROT system enables reproducible app traffic capture
for research community adoption and provides insights into app security

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多项式时间近似方案（PTAS）来解决市场份额排名问题，证明了其强NP难性，并通过黑盒归约方法实现了准PTAS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Derakhshan等人（2022）提出的市场份额排名问题在计算上存在未解决的问题，尤其是在结合多类Logit（MNL）选择模型和搜索型考虑-选择范式时。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文采用了多项式时间近似方案（PTAS）和黑盒归约方法，结合了Derakhshan等人（2022）的原始见解，并引入了新的技术发展和分析思路。

Result: 本文提出了一个多项式时间近似方案（PTAS），并证明了市场份额排名问题是强NP难问题。此外，还通过黑盒归约方法实现了准PTAS。

Conclusion: 本文的主要贡献是设计了一个多项式时间近似方案（PTAS），用于解决市场份额排名问题，并通过引入黑盒归约方法，将一般实例映射到“有界比率”实例，从而实现了优雅且易于实现的准PTAS。此外，还证明了市场份额排名问题是强NP难问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we address open computational questions regarding the market
share ranking problem, recently introduced by Derakhshan et al. (2022). Their
modelling framework incorporates the extremely popular Multinomial Logit (MNL)
choice model, along with a novel search-based consider-then-choose paradigm. In
a nutshell, the authors devised a Pandora's-Box-type search model, where
different customer segments sequentially screen through a ranked list of
products, one position after the other, forming their consideration set by
including all products viewed up until terminating their inspection procedure.
Subsequently, a purchasing decision out of this set is made based on a joint
MNL choice model.
  Our main contribution consists in devising a polynomial-time approximation
scheme for the market share ranking problem, utilizing fresh technical
developments and analytical ideas, in conjunction with revising the original
insights of Derakhshan et al. (2022). Along the way, we introduce a black-box
reduction, mapping general instances of the market share ranking problem into
``bounded ratio'' instances, showing that this result directly leads to an
elegant and easily-implementable quasi-PTAS. Finally, to provide a complete
computational characterization, we prove that the market share ranking problem
is strongly $\mathrm{NP}$-hard.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文针对k-EMV问题提出首个多项式时间加法近似方案，填补了k>1时的高效算法空白，并扩展至加权变体和ℓ_p低秩近似问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: k-EMV问题在统计学中已有70多年研究历史（称为"多维缩放"），但缺乏k>1时的高效近似算法。

Method: 通过针对低维嵌入的Sherali-Adams / Sum-of-Squares松弛的新分析，结合相关舍入技术，实现了高效的近似方案。

Result: 在(n·B)^poly(k, ε^{-1})时间内，获得目标值为OPT_EMV + ε‖D‖_2^2的嵌入方案。

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个多项式时间加法近似方案，用于解决k-EMV问题，填补了该领域在k>1时缺乏高效近似算法的空白。

Abstract: We consider the task of fitting low-dimensional embeddings to
high-dimensional data. In particular, we study the $k$-Euclidean Metric
Violation problem ($\textsf{$k$-EMV}$), where the input is $D \in
\mathbb{R}^{\binom{n}{2}}_{\geq 0}$ and the goal is to find the closest vector
$X \in \mathbb{M}_{k}$, where $\mathbb{M}_k \subset
\mathbb{R}^{\binom{n}{2}}_{\geq 0}$ is the set of all $k$-dimensional Euclidean
metrics on $n$ points, and closeness is formulated as the following
optimization problem, where $\| \cdot \|$ is the entry-wise $\ell_2$ norm: \[
  \textsf{OPT}_{\textrm{EMV}} = \min_{X \in \mathbb{M}_{k} } \Vert D - X
\Vert_2^2\,.\] Cayton and Dasgupta [CD'06] showed that this problem is NP-Hard,
even when $k=1$. Dhamdhere [Dha'04] obtained a $O(\log(n))$-approximation for
$\textsf{$1$-EMV}$ and leaves finding a PTAS for it as an open question
(reiterated recently by Lee [Lee'25]). Although $\textsf{$k$-EMV}$ has been
studied in the statistics community for over 70 years, under the name
"multi-dimensional scaling", there are no known efficient approximation
algorithms for $k > 1$, to the best of our knowledge.
  We provide the first polynomial-time additive approximation scheme for
$\textsf{$k$-EMV}$. In particular, we obtain an embedding with objective value
$\textsf{OPT}_{\textrm{EMV}} + \varepsilon \Vert D\Vert_2^2$ in $(n\cdot
B)^{\mathsf{poly}(k, \varepsilon^{-1})}$ time, where each entry in $D$ can be
represented by $B$ bits. We believe our algorithm is a crucial first step
towards obtaining a PTAS for $\textsf{$k$-EMV}$. Our key technical contribution
is a new analysis of correlation rounding for Sherali-Adams / Sum-of-Squares
relaxations, tailored to low-dimensional embeddings. We also show that our
techniques allow us to obtain additive approximation schemes for two related
problems: a weighted variant of $\textsf{$k$-EMV}$ and $\ell_p$ low-rank
approximation for $p>2$.

Motivation: 现实应用中，输入值通常为区间估计而非精确值，传统贝叶斯定理无法直接处理这种不确定性。

Method: 开发了一个保守的区间Type-2贝叶斯定理版本，并设计了一种新颖的算法，用于将专家提供的区间编码为IT2模糊隶属函数。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个区间Type-2版本的贝叶斯定理，解决了输入区间模糊隶属函数可能导致的输出不一致问题，并提供了一个灵活的算法将专家提供的区间编码为IT2模糊隶属函数。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架通过结合NLP和多模态LLMs，成功地将GDDs转化为功能性的Unity游戏原型，显著提升了AI辅助游戏开发的效率和质量。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large
Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an end-to-end system that parses GDDs,
extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game
design to implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述转化为MiniZinc模型需要逻辑推理和约束编程专业知识，这一过程具有挑战性。

Method: 通过多个专注于特定全局约束类型的LLM代理分解建模任务，每个代理负责检测和生成特定类别的约束代码，最后由一个组装代理整合为完整的MiniZinc模型。

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法在性能上优于一次性提示和思维链提示等基线方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个多代理LLM框架，用于将自然语言描述转化为MiniZinc模型，并展示了其优于基线方法的性能，同时提出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

Result: TCE显著延迟了递归训练中的模型崩溃，将模型崩溃前的保真度区间延长了2.3倍以上，且方法跨模态通用。

Conclusion: 设计损失函数是一种简单而强大的工具，可以在合成数据日益增多的时代保持生成模型的质量。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种上下文条件提示方法，通过优化示例和指令结构，显著提高了冷启动推荐任务中LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动用户问题进一步限制了推荐系统对历史行为信息的访问效果，因此需要一种有效的方法来优化推荐任务中使用的少样本大型语言模型（LLM）的指令提示。

Method: 我们引入了一种上下文条件提示制定方法P(u, Ds) → R̂，其中u是冷启动用户配置文件，Ds是策划的支持集，R̂是预测的排名项目列表。该方法基于对基于Transformer的自回归LLM（如BioGPT、LLaMA-2、GPT-4）的系统实验，通过优化示例注入和指令结构，显著提高了在低数据设置下模型的precision@k和NDCG分数。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过优化示例注入和指令结构，可以显著提高冷启动推荐任务中LLM的precision@k和NDCG分数。

Conclusion: 本文表明，基于提示的适应方法可以被视为解决基于大型语言模型（LLM）的推荐系统中冷启动问题的一种途径。

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人类协调任务逐渐委托给自主智能体，评估智能体在动态多智能体环境中的谈判过程变得至关重要。

Method: 在动态谈判设置中直接比较人类（N = 216）、LLMs（GPT-4o、Gemini 1.5 Pro）和贝叶斯智能体，捕捉结果和行为动态。

Result: 贝叶斯智能体通过激进优化获得最高盈余，但频繁拒绝交易；人类和LLMs总体盈余相似，但行为差异显著：LLMs倾向于保守让步，人类则更策略性、冒险且注重公平。

Conclusion: 性能对等（常见于智能体评估中）可能掩盖了过程和一致性上的根本差异，这些差异对于实际部署在现实世界协调任务中至关重要。

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) actions and measurements are among the priorities
of financial institutions, for which machine learning (ML) has shown to have a
high potential. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and systematic
approach for developing ML pipelines to identify high-risk bank clients in a
dataset curated for Task 1 of the University of Toronto 2023-2024 Institute for
Management and Innovation (IMI) Big Data and Artificial Intelligence
Competition. The dataset included 195,789 customer IDs, and we employed a
16-step design and statistical analysis to ensure the final pipeline was
robust. We also framed the data in a SQLite database, developed SQL-based
feature engineering algorithms, connected our pre-trained model to the
database, and made it inference-ready, and provided explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) modules to derive feature importance. Our pipeline achieved
a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.961
with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.005. The proposed pipeline achieved second
place in the competition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的空间推理能力有限，缺乏人类空间智能的灵活性和上下文感知能力，因此需要开发更接近神经科学的解决方案。

Method: 通过分析空间神经模型，引入了一个包含六个核心计算模块的新框架：生物启发的多模态感知、多感官整合、自我中心-异中心转换、人工认知地图、空间记忆和空间推理。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于神经科学原理的计算框架，旨在弥合AI在空间推理能力上的差距，并为其在虚拟和物理环境中的应用提供了结构化路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Conclusion: ProgD通过动态异构图建模和多尺度解码策略，显著提升了多智能体运动预测的准确性和一致性，在多个基准测试中取得了最优性能。

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Conclusion: 论文展示了如何利用最小支持子锦标赛为各种锦标赛规则生成紧凑、认证且直观的解释，从而增强可解释AI。

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Conclusion: TORSO作为一种无需依赖手动构建的少样本示例的方法，能够有效激发LLMs的内在推理能力，从而在多样化的任务中生成合理的响应，并在多个LLMs基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

TL;DR: SEDM是一种自演化分布式内存框架，通过可验证写入准入、自调度内存控制器和跨领域知识扩散，解决了多智能体系统中内存管理的挑战，提高了推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期多智能体系统产生的海量轨迹和历史交互需要高效的内存管理，现有方法存在噪声积累、内存扩张和跨领域泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: SEDM框架整合了可验证的写入准入、自调度内存控制器和跨领域知识扩散技术。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，SEDM提高了推理准确性，同时减少了令牌开销，并能将从事实验证中提取的知识用于增强多跳推理。

Conclusion: SEDM作为一种可扩展且可持续的内存机制，为开放式多智能体协作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨量子模型因其更高的训练效率是否能提升组合泛化任务的性能，以解决当前AI工具（如视觉语言模型）在组合泛化方面的不足。

Method: 通过将组合张量模型的表示解释为希尔伯特空间中的表示，并训练变分量子电路来学习这些表示，应用于需要组合泛化的图像描述任务。采用了两种图像编码技术：基于二进制图像向量的多热编码（MHE）和基于CLIP模型提取的图像向量的角度/幅度编码。

Result: 使用噪声MHE编码取得了良好的概念验证结果；在CLIP图像向量上的表现虽参差不齐，但仍优于经典组合模型。

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化任务中表现出潜力，尤其是在使用噪声MHE编码时取得了良好的概念验证结果，尽管在CLIP图像向量上的表现参差不齐，但仍优于经典组合模型。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统顺序计算模式在确保准确性的同时，难以满足实时应用所需的高频'思考'需求。

Method: Auras通过解耦感知与生成模块，并提供受控的流水线并行性，以实现高且稳定的吞吐量。为解决并行性增加时的数据陈旧问题，Auras建立了一个公共上下文供感知与生成共享。

Result: 实验结果表明，Auras平均提高了2.54倍的吞吐量，同时达到原始准确性的102.7%。

Conclusion: Auras算法-系统协同设计框架有效提高了具身AI代理的推理频率，同时保持了高准确性，克服了顺序计算的限制。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在长任务中的失败源于执行错误而非推理能力，且模型规模扩大虽能提升执行能力，但自我调节效应仍存在，强调执行能力对长任务的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到单步准确性的边际增益可以转化为任务长度的指数级改进，但LLM在简单任务延长时失败的原因在于执行错误而非推理能力不足。

Method: 提出通过明确提供解决长视野任务所需的知识和计划来隔离执行能力，并比较不同规模模型在多步任务中的表现。

Result: 发现更大模型即使在小模型100%单步准确率的情况下也能正确执行更多步骤，但模型单步准确率随步骤增加而下降，且自我调节效应不随模型规模扩大而减少。

Conclusion: 通过关注执行能力，本研究旨在调和关于大型语言模型（LLM）为何能解决复杂推理问题却在简单任务延长时失败的争论，并强调了模型规模和顺序测试时间计算对长视野任务的巨大益处。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: \muFork 是一种单地址空间操作系统设计，支持 POSIX fork 并保持轻量性和隔离性，利用 CHERI 技术解决指针问题，在实际应用中性能显著优于传统系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单地址空间操作系统因其轻量性而具有优势，但设计上无法兼容多进程 POSIX 应用程序。\muFork 旨在解决这一问题，同时保持轻量性、兼容性和隔离性。

Method: \muFork 通过在一个单地址空间内为子进程创建父进程内存的副本来模拟 POSIX 进程（\muprocesses），并利用 CHERI 技术解决指针重定位和隔离问题。

Result: \muFork 在 Redis 快照、Nginx 多工作器部署和 Zygote FaaS 工作器预热等实际应用中表现优异，比传统操作系统在轻量性指标上高出一个数量级，例如 fork 速度提高了 3.7 倍。

Conclusion: \muFork 是一种单地址空间操作系统设计，支持在现代硬件上实现 POSIX fork，同时不牺牲轻量性、兼容性或隔离性。通过利用 CHERI 技术，\muFork 成功解决了指针重定位和隔离问题，并在实际应用中显著优于传统操作系统。

Abstract: Single-address-space operating systems have well-known lightweightness
benefits that result from their central design idea: the kernel and
applications share a unique address space. This model makes these operating
systems (OSes) incompatible by design with a large class of software:
multiprocess POSIX applications. Indeed, the semantics of the primitive used to
create POSIX processes, fork, are inextricably tied to the existence of
multiple address spaces.
  Prior approaches addressing this issue trade off lightweightness,
compatibility and/or isolation. We propose {\mu}Fork, a single-address-space
operating system design supporting POSIX fork on modern hardware without
compromising on any of these key objectives. {\mu}Fork emulates POSIX processes
({\mu}processes) and achieves fork by creating for the child a copy of the
parent {\mu}process' memory at a different location within a single address
space. This approach presents two challenges: relocating the child's absolute
memory references (pointers), as well as providing user/kernel and
{\mu}processes isolation without impacting lightweightness. We address them
using CHERI. We implement {\mu}Fork and evaluate it upon three real-world
use-cases: Redis snapshots, Nginx multi-worker deployments, and Zygote FaaS
worker warm-up. {\mu}Fork outperforms previous work and traditional monolithic
OSes on key lightweightness metrics by an order of magnitude, e.g. it can offer
a fork-bound FaaS function throughput 24% higher than that of a monolithic OS,
and can fork a {\mu}process in 54{\mu}s, 3.7x faster than a traditional fork.

Abstract: Harmonic decomposition of surfaces, such as spherical and spheroidal
harmonics, is used to analyze morphology, reconstruct, and generate surface
inclusions of particulate microstructures. However, obtaining high-quality
meshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open
question. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating
the harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base
domains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional
sampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis
functions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or
generation. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality
discretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical
simulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent
this issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for
resampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an
equalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear
diffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain,
thereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on
surfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent
spheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods. The results show a substantial
improvement in the quality metrics for surface triangulation. Unlike
traditional surface reconstruction and meshing techniques, this approach
preserves surface morphology, along with the areas and volumes of surfaces. We
discuss the results and the associated computational costs for large 2D and 3D
microstructures, such as digital twins of concrete and stone masonry, and their
future applications.

TL;DR: CameraVDP框架结合相机重建和视觉差异预测器，解决了传统显示器测量方法无法捕捉高频伪影的问题，并通过多个应用验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于稀疏辐射采样的显示器测量方法无法捕捉空间变化的显示伪影，而相机虽具有足够空间分辨率却会引入光学、采样和光度失真。因此，需要一种能够结合物理测量和视觉系统模型的方法来评估失真是否可见。

Conclusion: 通过结合相机重建流程和视觉差异预测器（VDP），CameraVDP框架为显示器的感知评估提供了一种有效方法，能够同时解决相机测量的不准确性和视觉差异预测的问题。

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical
for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional
display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a
model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they
fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer
sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and
photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined
with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to
be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a
combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference
predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and
visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image
stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,
homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function
as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual
Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli
under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the
proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel
detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our
uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper
bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals
for VDP quality scores.

Conclusion: 本文提出的分布式协调方法在通信能力有限的环境中有效减少了任务重叠，特别是在处理主动和非对称障碍时表现出色。

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了基于单丝纤维束的晶格桁架无人机框架的潜力，3DFiT作为一种可扩展且高效的制造方法，为轻量化和复杂拓扑结构提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly
growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames.
However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve
complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate
components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally,
maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting
structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face
Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for
weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering
(3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment,
eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly.
Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high
specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic,
outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs
only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing
structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three
minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under
operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow
lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and
efficient manufacturing method.

Motivation: Koopman算子理论虽能有效建模动态系统，但无法保证收敛到目标轨迹或指定终点，这在从演示中学习（LfD）时是必要的。

Method: 提出KoopMotion方法，将运动流场建模为Koopman算子参数化的动态系统，利用流场的发散特性实现平滑运动场，确保机器人远离目标轨迹时仍能收敛并跟踪至终点。

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上验证了KoopMotion的有效性，包括谱分析。物理实验验证了其在非静态流体环境中的适用性，仅需3%的LASA数据集即可生成密集运动计划，时空动态建模效果显著优于基线。

Conclusion: KoopMotion通过Koopman算子参数化的运动流场，有效实现了机器人从任意初始状态到目标轨迹的平滑收敛和跟踪，在样本效率和时空动态建模效果上显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive
actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This
study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading
manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive
gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the
topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional
actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to
diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed,
and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping
configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is
utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust
adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the
UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and
effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work
underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in
applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the
specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends
to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the
development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust
performance.

Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in
unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex
terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we
propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
(LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM
provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of
mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for
terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the
robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that
promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM
trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and
stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes
stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately
evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and
robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal
robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results
demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and
consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.

observability for exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an
implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to guide exploration. To
support scalable training and generalization, we develop a point cloud-based
simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps across diverse scenes,
enabling sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments demonstrate that AEOS significantly improves odometry
accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned
baselines, while maintaining real-time performance under onboard computational
constraints. The project page can be found at

Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated
planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking
in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on
instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that
predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between
initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of
dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that
incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View
(FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions.
Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances
goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on
information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at
promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots,
we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency,
safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion in outdoor environments presents significant
challenges for quadruped robots. Accurate environmental prediction and
effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain
difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To
address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter
proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework
employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance
while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through
an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between
estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental
validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in
complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with
degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a
practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field
conditions. Project website: https://RENet-Loco.github.io/

Conclusion: OmniEVA通过其创新的任务自适应3D接地机制和体现感知推理框架，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在体现智能领域的适应性和实用性，实现了在多种下游场景中的强大表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

Conclusion: VLA-Adapter通过轻量级策略模块和桥接注意力机制，有效降低了VLA模型对大规模VLM和预训练的依赖，实现了高性能且快速的推理速度。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between
perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

Method: 1. 采用混合铰链-梁结构（TwistBeam和BendBeam）解耦扭转和弯曲应力；2. 设计被动限制器通过机械约束和安全检测确保操作安全；3. 开发实时疲劳感知方法，通过电机扭矩估计刚度，实现在线疲劳评估。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的疲劳感知连续机器人设计通过混合铰链-梁结构、被动限制器和实时疲劳估计方法，显著减少了疲劳积累，提高了长期操作的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design,
making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments.
However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation
and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural
failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots
remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we
propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a
Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and
bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,
while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress
magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains
motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect
corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and
(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor
torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional
sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation
by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical
limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of
structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.

Abstract: Advancing research in fields like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) and autonomous navigation critically depends on reliable and
reproducible multimodal datasets. While several influential datasets have
driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing
modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying
hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a
novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not
limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR,
multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and
synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across
modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its
capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted
scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release
SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative
indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized
multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based
SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions.
Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR
and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining
open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive
benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM
algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Detecting incipient slip enables early intervention to prevent object
slippage and enhance robotic manipulation safety. However, deploying such
systems on edge platforms remains challenging, particularly due to energy
constraints. This work presents a neuromorphic tactile sensing system based on
the NeuroTac sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin and a spiking
convolutional neural network (SCNN) for slip-state classification. The SCNN
model achieves 94.33% classification accuracy across three classes (no slip,
incipient slip, and gross slip) in slip conditions induced by sensor motion.
Under the dynamic gravity-induced slip validation conditions, after temporal
smoothing of the SCNN's final-layer spike counts, the system detects incipient
slip at least 360 ms prior to gross slip across all trials, consistently
identifying incipient slip before gross slip occurs. These results demonstrate
that this neuromorphic system has stable and responsive incipient slip
detection capability.

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

*Taisei Mogi,Mari Saito,Yoshihiro Nakata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MOFU, a robot with whole-body expansion-contraction movements, significantly enhances perceived animacy, especially when combined with locomotion, suggesting such movements are crucial for future robot design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effect of whole-body expansion-contraction movements, which are observed in living organisms but often overlooked in robot design, on animacy perception in humans.

Method: Developed a mobile robot called 'MOFU' capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and covered with a fluffy exterior. Conducted an online survey using videos of MOFU's behavior, with participants rating impressions using the Godspeed Questionnaire Series.

Result: Expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Combining expansion-contraction with locomotion further enhanced animacy ratings compared to locomotion alone. However, presenting two MOFUs did not significantly increase animacy compared to a single robot.

Conclusion: Volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.

Abstract: Robots for therapy and social interaction are often intended to evoke
"animacy" in humans. While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements,
little attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction,
volume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on
animacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called "MOFU (Morphing Fluffy
Unit)," capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and
covered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a "Jitterbug" structure, a
geometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in
diameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a
differential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect
of expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos
of MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed
Questionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state
with and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that
expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we
hypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a
single robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference
emerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion
conditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,
animacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that
volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived
animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in
future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

Abstract: Serverless computing provides dynamic scalability, but its infrastructure
overhead becomes a bottleneck for emerging workloads such as LLM agents, which
exhibit unpredictable invocation patterns and variable resource demands. Our
analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless
platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding
motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We
present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container-
and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents.
TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes
and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution
environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv
leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations
show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in
container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61%
memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like
E2B.

Abstract: Distributed systems require robust, scalable identifier schemes to ensure
data uniqueness and efficient indexing across multiple nodes. This paper
presents a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of distributed identifiers,
comparing traditional auto-increment keys with UUIDv4, UUIDv7, and ULIDs. We
combine mathematical calculation of collision probabilities with empirical

Abstract: Variant calling is the first step in analyzing a human genome and aims to
detect variants in an individual's genome compared to a reference genome. Due
to the computationally-intensive nature of variant calling, genomic data are
increasingly processed in cloud environments as large amounts of compute and
storage resources can be acquired with the pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this
paper, we address the problem of efficiently executing a variant calling
pipeline for a workload of human genomes on graphics processing unit
(GPU)-enabled machines. We propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach
for optimizing the workload execution to minimize the total execution time. Our
approach encompasses two key techniques: The first technique employs ML to
predict the execution times of different stages in a variant calling pipeline
based on the characteristics of a genome sequence. Using the predicted times,
the second technique generates optimal execution plans for the machines by
drawing inspiration from the flexible job shop scheduling problem. The plans
are executed via careful synchronization across different machines. We
evaluated our approach on a workload of publicly available genome sequences
using a testbed with different types of GPU hardware. We observed that our
approach was effective in predicting the execution times of variant calling
pipeline stages using ML on features such as sequence size, read quality,
percentage of duplicate reads, and average read length. In addition, our
approach achieved 2X speedup (on an average) over a greedy approach that also
used ML for predicting the execution times on the tested workload of sequences.
Finally, our approach achieved 1.6X speedup (on an average) over a dynamic
approach that executed the workload based on availability of resources without
using any ML-based time predictions.

TL;DR: CoTAM是一个一致性感知的任务图建模框架，通过解耦和量化一致性影响，提升了动态工作负载下任务图建模的准确性和通用性。

Conclusion: CoTAM框架通过解耦一致性效应并量化其影响，显著提升了任务图建模的准确性和通用性，尤其是在动态工作负载和多核系统中。

Abstract: As multicore systems continue to scale, cache coherence has emerged as a
critical determinant of system performance, with coherence behavior and task
execution closely intertwined, reshaping inter-task dependencies. Task graph
modeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as
the foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these
strategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world
applications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,
limiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task
graph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they
either rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features
without producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed
scheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often
overlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and
actual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a
Coherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that
constructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the
impact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution,
quantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers
inter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation. Extensive
experiments show that CoTAM outperforms implicit methods, bridging the gap
between dynamic workload behavior and existing designs while demonstrating the
importance of incorporating cache coherence into task graph modeling for
accurate and generalizable system-level analysis.

stable, cold starts and better execution performance, particularly for
I/O-heavy tasks.

Abstract: Collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to enable low-capability edge nodes to cooperatively execute
computation-intensive tasks. However, straggling edge nodes (stragglers)
significantly degrade the performance of MEC systems by prolonging computation
latency. While coded distributed computing (CDC) as an effective technique is
widely adopted to mitigate straggler effects, existing CDC schemes exhibit two
critical limitations: (i) They cannot successfully decode the final result
unless the number of received results reaches a fixed recovery threshold, which
seriously restricts their flexibility; (ii) They suffer from inherent poles in
their encoding/decoding functions, leading to decoding inaccuracies and
numerical instability in the computational results. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes an approximated CDC scheme based on
barycentric rational interpolation. The proposed CDC scheme offers several
outstanding advantages. Firstly, it can decode the final result leveraging any
returned results from workers. Secondly, it supports computations over both
finite and real fields while ensuring numerical stability. Thirdly, its
encoding/decoding functions are free of poles, which not only enhances
approximation accuracy but also achieves flexible accuracy tuning. Fourthly, it
integrates a novel BRI-based gradient coding algorithm accelerating the
training process while providing robustness against stragglers. Finally,
experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is superior to existing
CDC schemes in both waiting time and approximate accuracy.

Abstract: In distributed systems with asymmetric trust, each participant is free to
make its own trust assumptions about others, captured by an asymmetric quorum
system. This contrasts with ordinary, symmetric quorum systems and threshold
models, where trust assumptions are uniformly shared among participants.
Fundamental problems like reliable broadcast and consensus are unsolvable in
the asymmetric model if quorum systems satisfy only the classical properties of
consistency and availability. Existing approaches overcome this by introducing
stronger assumptions. We show that some of these assumptions are overly
restrictive, so much so that they effectively eliminate the benefits of
asymmetric trust. To address this, we propose a new approach to characterize
asymmetric problems and, building upon it, present algorithms for reliable
broadcast and consensus that require weaker assumptions than previous
solutions. Our methods are general and can be extended to other core problems
in systems with asymmetric trust.
