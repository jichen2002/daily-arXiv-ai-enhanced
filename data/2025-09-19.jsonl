When faced with such unexpected outcomes, developers\noften repeatedly rerun jobs hoping for true success, but this practice is known\nto increase CI costs and reduce productivity. While recent studies have focused\non intermittent job failures, no prior work has investigated silent failures,\nwhere build jobs are marked as successful but fail to complete all or part of\ntheir tasks. Such silent failures often go unnoticed, creating an illusion of\nsuccess with detrimental consequences such as bugs escaping into production.\nThis paper presents the first empirical study of silent failures through the\npractice of rerunning successful jobs. An analysis of 142,387 jobs across 81\nindustrial projects shows that 11% of successful jobs are rerun, with 35% of\nthese reruns occurring after more than 24 hours. Using mixed-effects models on\n32 independent variables (AUC of 85%), we identified key factors associated\nwith reruns of successful jobs, notably testing and static analysis tasks,\nscripting languages like Shell, and developers prior rerun tendencies. A\nfurther analysis of 92 public issues revealed 11 categories of silent failures\naligning with these factors, the most frequent being artifact operation errors,\ncaching errors, and ignored exit codes.

Yet\nthis promise is undercut by the cold setart problem, where invoking a function\nafter a period of inactivity triggers costly initialization before any work can\nbegin. Even with today's high-speed storage, the prevailing view is that\nachieving sub-millisecond cold starts requires keeping state resident in\nmemory.\n  This paper challenges that assumption. Our analysis of existing\nsnapshot/restore mechanisms show that OS-level limitations, not storage speed,\nare the real barrier to ultra-fast restores from disk. These limitations force\ncurrent systems to either restore state piecemeal in a costly manner or capture\ntoo much state, leading to longer restore times and unpredictable performance.\nFuthermore, current memory primitives exposed by the OS make it difficult to\nreliably fetch data into memory and avoid costly runtime page faults.\n  To overcome these barriers, we present Spice, an execution engine\npurpose-built for serverless snapshot/restore. Spice integrates directly with\nthe OS to restore kernel state without costly replay and introduces dedicated\nprimitives for restoring memory mappings efficiently and reliably. As a result,\nSpice delivers near-warm performance on cold restores from disk, reducing\nlatency by up to 14.9x over state-of-the-art process-based systems and 10.6x\nover VM-based systems.

As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain\nunderutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.\nSpecifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly\nparticipate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in\nan image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with\nusers query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method\nsupports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable\ndecision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval.

The\nsampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the\ndiscontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish\na unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare\nthree distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and\nparameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the\nproposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three\nobjectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves\ncompetitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.\nVideos are available at https://zhaofangguo.github.io/racing_mppi/"}

To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal\nprediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence\nmeasure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous\ncommands.

Solving it requires addressing three key\nchallenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,\nquadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of\nunknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path\nIntegral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the\nfirst two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can\neffectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the\nfull quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs\nsuch as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is\nlimited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by\nlarge obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI\n(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory\nonline based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,\nPA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown\nregions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood\nof finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we\ndemonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and\nmapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging\nsettings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails.

In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for\nImage Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image\nclassification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an\nOutliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted\nprompts.

Products of the same type from different\nbrands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be\ntaken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored\ncatalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to\ndistinguish these subtle but important local differences.

In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid\nmethod, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging\nthe advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching\napproaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval\naccuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)\nis employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products\nfrom a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a\nsegmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)\nfine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the\nfiltered candidates.

However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way\nmode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This\napproach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.\nIn this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our\nframework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a\nmulti-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.\nSpecifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM\nfor collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection\nmodule that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the\nVLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable\nconditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation\nstrategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using\nambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the\naction component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the\ninteraction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The\ntraining strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then\ngenerate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router\nthat helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions.

However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within\nthe retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior.

The attack is crafted\nto achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,\nto encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across\ndiverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that\nsimulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the\ndiscovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.\nBuilding on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to\nevolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and\nstealthiness.

We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference.

To address this limitation, we\npropose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels\nleveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event\nstream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available\noff-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,\nwe propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),\nor deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from\nmonocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world\ndatasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive\nperformance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive\ndepth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance."}

However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to\nadversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for\nsafety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within\nCLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding\nmodest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a\ntwo-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust\nunified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on\nclean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages\ncross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between\nclean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise\ndistributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,\nAudio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the\nLanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy\nand norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without\nsacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer\nmulti-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,\nand other autonomy settings."}

Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be\neffective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this\npaper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for\ndesigning vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers\ndefining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety\nfilters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between\ntraining from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the\nmodels they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is\nsuperior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions\nare better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical\nconsiderations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices."}

Existing single-view approaches often fail in\nunstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and\ngeneralization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,\nstruggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address\nthese challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a\nMulti-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP\n(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages\nproprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both\nclose-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant\nend-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed\nby the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational\nefficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness\nnear singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world\nenvironments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates\nand reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines.

To address these limitations,\nwe propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration\nframework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams\nbased on the evolving diagnostic context.

As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or\nfine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high\ncomputational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,\ninference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step\nRecursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during\ninference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising\nstep to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages\noptical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space\nand selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.\nDual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths\nto adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural\nsignals.
