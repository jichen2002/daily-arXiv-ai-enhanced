While popular\nbenchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated\ncode, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs\nprovide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its\nfunctional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on\nreporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness,\nthe causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this\nwork, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs,\nrevealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code\nfunctionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these\nCEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally\ndissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this\ngap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117\ncode pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a\nfunctional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to\nperform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through\ndifferential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and,\nat the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order\nof magnitude more tests than prior work.

Building upon prior work in\ngradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL\nintroduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances\nmodel interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive\nattention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features\nat multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at\ndifferent granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance\ncontributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive\nvisual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual\nrelationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on\nstandard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship\ninformation into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused\nand contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language\nmodels process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various\ndomains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications\nrequiring high interpretability and reliability."}

Given a metric space $(P,\\mathsf{dist})$, where $P$ is a set of\nelements and $\\mathsf{dist}$ a distance metric, a family of sets\n$\\mathcal{H}\\subseteq 2^P$, and parameters $k, z$, the goal is to compute a set\nof $k$ centers $S\\subseteq P$ and a family of $z$ sets $H\\subseteq \\mathcal{H}$\nto minimize $\\max_{p\\in P\\setminus(\\bigcup_{h\\in H} h)} \\min_{s\\in\nS}\\mathsf{dist}(p,s)$.

Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them.

Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was\nmeasured.\n  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools.\nExcept for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was\nlower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors\narose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses\nfrom EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding\nthe context window.\n  Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a\nreal hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while\nhighlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for\nsecure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI\nagents. Future work should extend beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation,\nand clinical impact assessment, paving the way for effective integration of\ngenerative AI into clinical practice."}

The upper layer explores diverse interaction modes\nusing reinforcement learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A*\nsearch, while the lower layer refines solutions via parallelizable convex\noptimization. By partitioning space among neighboring vehicles and constructing\nrobust feasible corridors, the method decouples the joint non-convex problem\ninto convex subproblems solved efficiently in parallel. This design alleviates\nthe step-size trade-off while ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision\navoidance. Experiments show that SMART consistently outperforms baselines. On\n50 m x 50 m maps, it sustains over 90% success within 1 s up to 25 vehicles,\nwhile baselines often drop below 50%. On 100 m x 100 m maps, SMART achieves\nabove 95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles,\nwith runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only\napproaches. Built on vehicle-to-everything communication, SMART incorporates\nvehicle-infrastructure cooperation through roadside sensing and agent\ncoordination, improving scalability and safety. Real-world experiments further\nvalidate this design, achieving planning times as low as 0.014 s while\npreserving cooperative behaviors."}

The LSB boundary is encoded as a\nDiscrete-Time High-Order CBF (DHOCBF), whose constraints are incorporated into\na nonlinear optimization framework. To improve feasibility, a novel relaxation\ntechnique is applied. The resulting framework ensure that the robot's\nrigid-body motion between consecutive time steps remains collision-free,\neffectively bridging discrete-time control and continuous-time safety. We show\nthat the proposed method handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot\ngeometries and generates collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in\ncluttered environments. Experiments demonstrate millisecond-level solve times\nand high prediction accuracy, highlighting both safety and efficiency beyond\nexisting CBF-based methods."}

Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and\nemotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire\nunderstanding remain underexplored.

To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional\nMultimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,\nwhich enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively\ncapture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,\nlow-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for\ncross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into\nsub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to\ncapture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an\nimage-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal\ninteraction at both local and global representations of image information.\nAdditionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale\nimage strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into\nsub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a\nmultimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as\nemotion and sentiment recognition.

We first present a novel\nperspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD\nmetrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this\nchallenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.\nThe core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then\naggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size\nimbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated\noptimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle\nand significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad\nrange of sizes.

Moreover, they typically apply uniform\ntraining strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in\nsuboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above\nchallenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label\nConsistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence\nreliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.\nSpecifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish\nclean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency\nto uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label\nConsistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the\nseparation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs.

More in detail, we investigate\nwell-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated\nGradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models\nfor MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We\nassess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively\nperturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the\nexplainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the\nmodel's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some\nlimitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we\nadditionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the\nreliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the\npredicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and\nIntegrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important\ninput features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,\nwe show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an\nexplainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios\nwhere conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results."}

Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of\nthe proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.\nMTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,\nand an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield\nprediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The\noutstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and\nprovides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,\npotentially improving crop yields."}

We build upon this\nby developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large\nLanguage Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by\nincorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that\ninjecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation\naccuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings\nhighlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that\nrequire complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge\nin a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and\ncontextually accurate images."}

However, we\nobserve that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.\nWhile similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models\n(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image\ninputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the \"sycophantic modality gap.\" To\nbetter understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to\nthe exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we\nfirst experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist\nmisleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also\nmakes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even\nif it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective\nTuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,\nallowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or\ncorrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a\nsignificant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,\nwithout resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective\ninstructions."}

While existing methods\naddress training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination\nmodels, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model\nsubsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified\nmodality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical\nself-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges\nrepresentation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,\nfeature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the\nhybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the\nintrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for\nmissing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant\ncontrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among\nincomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight\nreverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual\nsemantics in the frozen encoder.

Without bells and\nwhistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under\ndiverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D\nsemantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.
