We focus on a typical\nmulti-server FL architecture, where the regions covered by different edge\nservers (ESs) may overlap. A key observation of this architecture is that\nclients located in the overlapping areas can access edge models from multiple\nESs. Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with\nOverlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential\nof these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The\noverall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains\nlocal model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the\nrespective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated\nedge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying. Upon receiving the relayed\nmodels, each ES performs a second aggregation and subsequently broadcasts the\nupdated model to covered clients. The existence of ROCs enables the model of\neach ES to be disseminated to the other ESs in a decentralized manner, which\nindirectly achieves intercell model and speeding up the training process,\nmaking it well-suited for latency-sensitive edge environments.

Citrus Under Protective\nScreening (CUPS) exemplifies this need in digital agriculture, where citrus\nresearch facilities are instrumented with numerous sensors monitoring\nenvironmental conditions and detecting protective screening damage. CUPS\ndemands access to computational fluid dynamics codes for modeling environmental\nconditions and guiding real-time interventions like water application or\nrobotic repairs. These computing domains have contrasting properties: sensor\nnetworks provide low-performance, limited-capacity, unreliable data access,\nwhile high-performance facilities offer enormous computing power through\nhigh-latency batch processing. Private 5G networks present novel capabilities\naddressing this challenge by providing low latency, high throughput, and\nreliability necessary for near-real-time coupling of edge sensor networks with\nHPC simulations.

While recent advances have\nenabled very efficient algorithms for joint service placement, routing, and\nresource allocation for increasingly complex applications, current models fail\nto capture the non-linear relationship between delay and resource usage that\nbecomes especially relevant in AI-intensive workloads. In this paper, we extend\nthe cloud network flow optimization framework to support queuing-delay-aware\norchestration of distributed AI applications over edge-cloud infrastructures.\nWe introduce two execution models, Guaranteed-Resource (GR) and Shared-Resource\n(SR), that more accurately capture how computation and communication delays\nemerge from system-level resource constraints. These models incorporate M/M/1\nand M/G/1 queue dynamics to represent dedicated and shared resource usage,\nrespectively. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex due to the\nnon-linear delay terms. To overcome this, we develop SPARQ, an iterative\napproximation algorithm that decomposes the problem into two convex\nsub-problems, enabling joint optimization of service placement, routing, and\nresource allocation under nonlinear delay constraints. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the SPARQ not only offers a more faithful representation of\nsystem delays, but also substantially improves resource efficiency and the\noverall cost-delay tradeoff compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."}

This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to\naddress these issues: the integration of a secondary, \"metacognitive\" layer\nthat actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,\nthis layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined\nset of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions.

An empirical\nanalysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly\nincreases the overall task success rate.

First, one needs to\n_generate inputs_ that are syntactically and semantically correct, yet\nsufficiently diverse to cover behavior. Second, one needs an _oracle_ to _check\noutputs_ whether a test case is correct or not. Both problems become apparent\nin _protocol testing_, where inputs are messages exchanged between parties, and\noutputs are the responses of these parties.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protocol testing that combines\ninput generation and output checking in a single framework. We introduce _I/O\ngrammars_ as the first means to _completely_ specify the syntax and semantics\nof protocols, including messages, states, and interactions. Our implementation,\nbased on the FANDANGO framework, takes a single I/O grammar, and can act as a\n_test generator_, as a _mock object_, and as an _oracle_ for a _client_, a\n_server_, or both (or actually any number of parties), a versatility not found\nin any existing tool or formalism.

To address this, we propose\nconstraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified\nsafety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by\nconditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a\nlatent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned\nin a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely\nthe system may approach the constraint representation.

This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be\nsteered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate\ntailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of\nthis, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a\nmulti-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework\nnamed \\textbf{S}teerable \\textbf{A}dversarial scenario \\textbf{GE}nerator\n(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between\nadversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose\nhierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline\nalignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard\nfeasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed\nmodel, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a\ncontinuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating\ntheir weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through\nthe lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and\nrealism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving\npolicies.

We applied\nequally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants\nto ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary\nshift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes.

Building on this insight, we propose FedOC (Federated learning with\nOverlapping Clients), a novel framework designed to fully exploit the potential\nof these overlapping clients. In FedOC, overlapping clients could serve dual\nroles: (1) as Relay Overlapping Clients (ROCs), they forward edge models\nbetween neighboring ESs in real time to facilitate model sharing among\ndifferent ESs; and (2) as Normal Overlapping Clients (NOCs), they dynamically\nselect their initial model for local training based on the edge model delivery\ntime, which enables indirect data fusion among different regions of ESs. The\noverall FedOC workflow proceeds as follows: in every round, each client trains\nlocal model based on the earliest received edge model and transmits to the\nrespective ESs for model aggregation. Then each ES transmits the aggregated\nedge model to neighboring ESs through ROC relaying.

For\naccurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed\nby using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate\nhigh-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and\nground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature\nmatching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground\nimages, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences\nthrough intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the\nvalidation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature\nmatching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used\nmethods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can\nprovide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious\nincrease in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide\nenough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based\nscene rendering."}

The development of advanced control\nstrategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of\nscalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the\nneed of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves\ncontrolling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents\ntend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy\nfor a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces\nacting on the system.

In this work, we bring these avenues\ntogether in a unified framework: PAD (Parse-AugmentDistill), for learning\ngeneralizable bimanual policies from a single human video. Our method relies on\nthree steps: (a) parsing a human video demo into a robot-executable\nkeypoint-action trajectory, (b) employing bimanual task-and-motion-planning to\naugment the demonstration at scale without simulators, and (c) distilling the\naugmented trajectories into a keypoint-conditioned policy.

Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial\nregions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between\nanomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of\ncontrollable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring\ntwo novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the\nForeground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling\nalgorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly\nsynthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine\naggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented\nanomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the\nanomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,\npreserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.\nExtensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST\nconsistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream\nsegmentation tasks.

To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous\nsolutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress\nin this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the\nlack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field\ndeployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study\npresents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models\nfor deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of\nthis work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available\ndataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,\nderived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive\ncomparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO\narchitectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a\nhigh-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing\nplatforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the\nreal-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific\nmodel optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with\nGPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals\nthat smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and\nYOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and\ncomputational efficiency (FPS > 30).

However, incorporating pose\nconditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting\nthe optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional\nparameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.\n  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the\nreference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex\nattention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this\npure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing\nperformance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional\nparameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose\nstitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose\npreservation and output realism.
