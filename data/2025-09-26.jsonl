This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal\n$\\widetilde{O}(d \\log n)$ query algorithm is known due to\nHopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted\nthe power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in\nfact without this power there is an $\\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to\nDasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).\n  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning\nhalfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound,\nwe consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size\n$D$, and show tight bounds of $\\Theta(D + \\log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain\nan optimal $O(d + \\log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned\nhalfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \\log n)$ vs. $\\Omega(d + \\log n)$.\nIn fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean\nfunction $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$\nprovided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these\norderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each\nordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.\n  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal\nalgorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\\min(D + \\log(1/\\varepsilon),\n1/\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error\n$\\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a\n$c\\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This\nbound is optimal up to a $\\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting."}

Our key insight\nto this ill-posed problem is that by first estimating Bracketed 3D Gaussians\n(i.e., with different exposures) from single-exposure multi-view LDR images, we\nmay then be able to merge these bracketed 3D Gaussians into an HDR scene\nrepresentation. Specifically, SeHDR first learns base 3D Gaussians from\nsingle-exposure LDR inputs, where the spherical harmonics parameterize colors\nin a linear color space. We then estimate multiple 3D Gaussians with identical\ngeometry but varying linear colors conditioned on exposure manipulations.\nFinally, we propose the Differentiable Neural Exposure Fusion (NeEF) to\nintegrate the base and estimated 3D Gaussians into HDR Gaussians for novel view\nrendering.

Drawing from\ntemporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors\nexecution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations\nfrom expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely\nprimarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to\nthe natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method\ninstead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations\nand inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior\nindependent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language\nprovides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple\nexecution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt\nengineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing\nregression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The\napproach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to\nsolve multi-step reasoning tasks.

The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability\nspace, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack\nvariations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit\nintegrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The\nprimary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of\noffline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete\nspace, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events.

This dynamic adaptation allows the\nsystem to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more\neffectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning\nunit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling.

A\ncritical operation in edge inference is for an edge node (EN) to aggregate\nmulti-view sensory features extracted by distributed agents, thereby boosting\nperception accuracy. Over-the-air computing (AirComp) emerges as a promising\ntechnique for rapid feature aggregation by exploiting the waveform\nsuperposition property of analog-modulated signals, which is, however,\nincompatible with existing digital communication systems.

CHARM introduces a compact, invertible\ncontrol-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points\nrepresents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric\nparameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both\nartist-friendly design and learning-based generation.

By\ninterpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential \"hair language\", our\nautoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle\ntopology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation.

Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent\nediting in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent\nActivation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies\nwithout modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two\nstages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect\nstates associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing\nmodule that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy\ntowards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in\nmulti-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal\nperception of risk can induce safer behaviors.

Moreover, deploying these models in practical\nscenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model\nselection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of\nadvanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)\n(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,\nconsisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for\nblueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with\nsmartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled\ninstances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide\nrange of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the\nYOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while\nRT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR\nvariants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and\nthe mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To\nfurther enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using\nUnbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of\n1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in\n2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with\nRT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into\nSSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset\nand software programs of this study are made publicly available to support\nfurther research."}

The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19\npandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices,\nintroducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations\ntransition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working\narrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even\ntraditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While\nremote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new\nenvironment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement\namong remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize\nengagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing\non the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We\nstudied professionals from three software companies over several weeks,\nemploying a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected\nthrough self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using\nbiometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics.\nResults. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between\nonsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower\nengagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles\npositively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and\nafternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our\nresults offer insights into factors associated with engagement and\ndisengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement\nrecommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software\nteams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors\nfacing similar hybrid collaboration challenges."}

In this context, shared control refers\nto a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous\ndriving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced\ndriving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling\nlimits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle\navoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety\nbenefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective\nevaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on\nskill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term\nskill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or\nemploys other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this\ngap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic\nshared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers\nacquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an\nautonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a\nhighly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism\nalong with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from\nautonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two\nbenchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance\nduring training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed\nframework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the\nbenchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency."}

To address these limitations, we\npropose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of\ncontinuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy\nenables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning\nthrough three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks\ninto sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines\nsub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,\nachieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating\nin dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience\ninto App Map and Tricks.

While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously\nunexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and\ndiversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of\nsynthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification\ndesign and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we\nverify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test\nsuites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while\nquantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring\nrelaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By\nallowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,\nwe can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in\npass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and\ndiversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary\nthrough controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions\nand human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields\nconsistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as\ncurrently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it\ncannot be discarded, only recalibrated.

To address them, we\npropose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery\n(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic\ngrasping for zero-touch operation.

This enables a\nmulti-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,\nmaking it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for\ngeneralizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric\nsymmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine\npose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where\neach frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry\nrecovery.

Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to\nbridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and\nstructured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over\ntraditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However,\nexisting PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a\nfundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as\nwell as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we\npropose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces\npseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL\nsemantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages.\nFirst, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize\npseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code.\nSecond, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and\nemploy the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code\nimplementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different\nstyles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We\nbuild PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream\nprogramming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge\nconsistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval\naccuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer\nscenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets.

Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge\nDistillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite\nthe search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from\nthree types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.\nThese predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency\nduring the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search\nto balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs.

The resulting\nposterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments\na Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics.

Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in\neach network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support\nit, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,\nand how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we\nsystematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in\nmid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from\nmodality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is\nrobust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered\n(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared\ncode is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a\nforced-choice \"Pick-a-Pic\" task shows that human preferences for image-caption\nmatches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model\npairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to\na single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic\ndistinctions akin to human judgments.

Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,\nwe argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,\nfrom what plants to count to how to count plants.

This paper presents a novel\nmodel, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and\nGAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention\nmechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects\nwithin an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual\ncontext. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data\ndistributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable\nfeatures. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines\nvisual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.\nExtensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that\nour model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,\nparticularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting\nthe importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in\nadvancing VQA tasks.

Prior methods typically decompose the task into\ntwo independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that\nlimit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We\npropose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs\nin the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can\nbe enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier\nsignals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To\nthis end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware\nguidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are\nphysically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate\nDAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and\nlarge-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over\nprevious work on these metrics.

Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the\ndecision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches\nor misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained\nsignificant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance\ncompared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against\nadversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,\nparticularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI\nclassification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing\nrealistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.\nnon-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)\ntechnique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring\nnaturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of\nadversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification\nmodels. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary\nperson classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack\nsuccess rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%\n(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and\nfacebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%.

Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the\ndecision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches\nor misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained\nsignificant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance\ncompared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against\nadversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,\nparticularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI\nclassification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing\nrealistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.\nnon-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)\ntechnique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring\nnaturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of\nadversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification\nmodels. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary\nperson classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack\nsuccess rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%\n(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and\nfacebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%.
