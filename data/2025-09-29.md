TL;DR: 本文提出Random DPO框架，通过随机对比采样提升RRG准确性，实验显示性能提升5%，无需额外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中质量不足，而大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在通用领域的成功启发了通过类似LLM的训练策略（如对齐技术）提升RRG性能。

Method: 采用Direct Preference Optimization（DPO）框架，结合随机对比采样构建训练对，避免了对奖励模型或人工偏好标注的需求。

Result: 在三个最先进模型上补充Random DPO后，临床性能指标提升高达5%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Random DPO框架有效提升了放射学报告生成（RRG）的准确性，无需额外训练数据即可实现高达5%的临床性能提升。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过多模态分析改进了自闭症视频筛查工具，注视分类准确率提升至69%，整体准确率达74%，展示了可扩展筛查潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自闭症谱系障碍（ASC）的诊断复杂且资源密集，现有计算机辅助诊断方法在注视特征表现和现实世界泛化能力方面存在不足。

Method: 研究分析了包含168名ASC参与者（46%为女性）和157名非自闭症参与者（46%为女性）的标准视频数据集，进行了面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性（HRV）和注视行为的多模态分析，并引入了新的统计描述符来量化注视角度的变异性。

Result: 通过改进注视模型，注视分类准确率从64%提升至69%，结合多模态行为标记的晚期融合方法，整体分类准确率达到74%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过多模态行为标记分析实现的自闭症谱系障碍（ASC）视频筛查工具的潜力，其分类准确率达到74%，为自闭症评估提供了可扩展的支持。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA 是一种高效的内存压缩框架，通过选择性上下文保留提升 VLA 模型的推理效率和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) 模型在长时推理中因注意力二次成本和 KV 内存无限增长导致的扩展性问题。

Method: 该方法将 KV 缓存划分为固定大小的块，并利用循环门控模块根据学习到的效用分数对历史上下文进行总结和过滤。

Result: 理论上的推理速度提升达 1.21 倍，KV 内存减少 36%，且对任务成功率影响极小。

Conclusion: KV-Efficient VLA 提出了一种模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过选择性保留高实用性上下文，显著提升了推理效率和内存使用，同时保持任务成功率。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）在生成胸部X射线图像的放射学报告时存在事实错误和幻觉问题，阻碍了其临床转化。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现及其位置，构建了一个大型合成数据集，训练了一个新的多标签跨模态对比回归网络。

Result: 该方法在多个X射线数据集上的发现真实性预测和定位准确性方面表现出色，与基于真实情况的验证一致性相关系数达到0.997。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新颖的短语基础事实检查模型（FC模型），该模型在自动生成的胸部放射学报告中检测错误，并在多个X射线数据集上展示了其高准确性和定位能力，为放射学工作流程中的临床应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型多模态深度学习架构MDF-MLLM，通过融合多尺度特征显著提升了视网膜疾病分类的准确性，并在临床应用中展现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）难以捕捉对诊断视网膜疾病（如青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变和色素性视网膜炎）至关重要的低层次空间细节。

Method: 该研究开发了一种新型多模态深度学习架构MDF-MLLM，将U-Net编码器的跳跃特征与LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块集成，并通过补丁级投影和FiLM-based U-Net调制进行特征融合。

Result: MDF-MLLM在双类型疾病分类任务中实现了94%的准确率，比基线模型提高了56%。召回率和F1分数分别提升了67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM通过多尺度特征融合提供了一个通用、可解释且模块化的框架，显著提升了视网膜疾病分类的准确性和F1分数。该架构在临床决策支持系统中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPDA是一种多模态提示解耦攻击方法，通过LLM和视觉语言模型协作，绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的越狱方法难以绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，且图像模态的潜在漏洞未被充分探索。

Method: MPDA采用三步法：1) LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示；2) LLM将有害提示重写为自然对抗提示；3) 视觉语言模型生成图像标题，指导LLM迭代优化生成内容。

Result: MPDA成功绕过安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像。

Conclusion: MPDA通过多模态提示解耦攻击，有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成NSFW内容，同时保持语义一致性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结合显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测任务，并引入互学习模块（MLM），该方法在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决显著目标检测中因物体内部复杂性和卷积、池化操作步幅导致的不完整预测和不准确边界问题。

Method: 提出了一种结合显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测任务的训练方法，并开发了互学习模块（MLM）作为核心组件。

Result: 在七个具有挑战性的数据集上，该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测任务中均取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测任务，以及提出的互学习模块（MLM），在七个具有挑战性的数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAJORScore是一种新型多模态相关性评估指标，通过多模态联合表示显著提升评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标仅适用于双模态关联分析，限制了多模态相似性评估的准确性。

Method: 提出MAJORScore，通过多模态联合表示首次实现对多模态（N≥3）相关性的评估。

Result: 实验表明，MAJORScore在一致模态上提升26.03%-64.29%，在不一致模态上降低13.28%-20.54%。

Conclusion: MAJORScore是一种更可靠的多模态相似性评估指标，适用于大规模多模态数据集和模型性能评估。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用AI和数字化技术开发云平台，自动化脚手架检查，提高准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脚手架检查主要依赖视觉检查，耗时且易出错，可能导致不安全条件。因此，研究探索利用AI和数字化技术提升检查准确性和安全性。

Method: 开发了一个云基础的AI平台，处理和分析脚手架结构的点云数据，通过比较认证参考数据与最新点云数据来检测结构修改。

Result: 提出的系统能够自动化监测脚手架，减少人工检查的时间和精力，同时提高建筑工地的安全性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于人工智能和数字化的云平台，用于自动化脚手架结构监测，显著提高了检查的准确性和效率，从而提升了建筑工地的安全性。

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动提示工程框架，用于生成反事实图像（如大小对比），通过三个组件优化提示并构建数据集，实验显示其性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到图像生成技术发展迅速，但在细粒度可控性（尤其是反事实可控性）方面仍存在挑战。反事实可控性在支持创造力和探索性应用中至关重要。

Method: 框架包括三个组件：图像评估器（用于指导数据集构建）、监督提示重写器（生成修订后的提示）和DPO训练的排序器（选择最优修订提示）。还扩展了Grounded SAM以改进图像评估器。

Result: 构建了首个反事实大小文本-图像数据集，并通过改进的图像评估器实现了114%的性能提升。实验表明，该方法优于现有基线模型和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 本论文提出了一种自动提示工程框架，用于生成反事实图像，特别是在大小对比方面。通过实验验证，该方法优于现有基线模型和ChatGPT-4o，为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究证明O-Net和Theta-Net在非荧光光学显微镜中超分辨率成像中互补，性能取决于图像SNR，为经济型超分辨率方案提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学显微镜的分辨率限制（约200nm）通常需要昂贵的外部模块或特殊技术（如超分辨率荧光显微镜）。本研究旨在探索一种经济且适用于非专业环境的超分辨率光学显微镜替代方案。

Method: 研究评估了两种深度神经网络架构（O-Net和Theta-Net）在非荧光相位调制显微镜（如Zernike相位对比和微分干涉对比显微镜）中的超分辨率能力。通过原子力显微镜校准的纳米级特征测试目标进行验证。

Result: O-Net和Theta-Net在不同信噪比（SNR）条件下表现互补：高SNR时O-Net更有效，低SNR时Theta-Net更优。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，O-Net和Theta-Net在超分辨率光学显微镜中是互补而非竞争的方法，其性能受图像信噪比（SNR）的影响。高SNR时O-Net表现更佳，低SNR时Theta-Net更优，强调了模型架构与源图像SNR对超分辨率质量的重要性。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMTF-AVN模型，通过多目标架构和Transformer改进多模态融合，在导航任务中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在音频-视觉导航中常忽略深层次感知上下文，需要更高效的多模态融合策略。

Method: 采用多目标架构和优化的Transformer机制，动态过滤和选择性融合跨模态信息。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上取得最优性能，成功率和路径效率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DMTF-AVN模型在音频-视觉导航中表现出卓越的性能和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的多模态融合策略提供了新方向。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过一对一概念-神经元映射提升文本到图像扩散模型的概念遗忘效果，减少计算开销并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本到图像扩散模型中有效遗忘概念需要精确定位潜在空间中的概念表示，而现有方法存在概念表示分散和多概念共享神经元的问题。

Method: 引入SAEmnesia，一种监督稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化的概念标签促进一对一的概念-神经元映射，减少特征分裂并促进特征集中。

Result: SAEmnesia在训练时仅引入交叉熵计算的开销，推理时减少了96.67%的超参数搜索，并在UnlearnCanvas基准上比现有技术提高了9.22%，在序列遗忘任务中实现了28.4%的遗忘准确率提升。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过系统化的概念标记和专门的神经元训练，显著提升了文本到图像扩散模型中的概念遗忘效果，减少了计算开销，并在序列遗忘任务中展现出优越的可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个整合历史和当前乳腺X光片的深度学习模型，显著提高了乳腺癌预测准确性，尤其在乳腺密度变化的女性中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单一或有限的先前乳腺X光片，且缺乏对现实世界中不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应性。

Method: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，用于捕捉预测乳腺癌的空间和时间模式。

Result: LongiMam在包含先前和当前访问的情况下表现优于单次访问模型，且在不同风险组（如乳腺密度高的女性和55岁及以上女性）中均表现出高效性。

Conclusion: LongiMam通过整合历史和当前乳腺X光片，显著提高了乳腺癌预测的准确性，支持在筛查程序中使用重复乳腺X光片来优化风险分层。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

Method: 论文通过相关性分析评估了流行的CNN架构与人类行为和fMRI数据在图像情感评估任务中的一致性。此外，还引入了Object2Brain框架，结合GradCAM和对象检测技术，分析了不同对象类别对CNN与人类相关性的影响。

Result: 研究结果显示，CNN在复杂社会认知任务中难以超越简单视觉处理，未能反映高阶大脑处理。不同CNN架构对对象类别的敏感性存在差异。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是，尽管CNN在一般视觉感知任务中与人类大脑有相似之处，但在更复杂的社会认知任务中，CNN难以超越简单的视觉处理，未能反映高阶大脑处理。此外，论文提出了Object2Brain框架，用于研究不同对象类别对CNN与人类相关性分析的影响。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDebug通过移除不良概念和重新训练，有效减少概念瓶颈模型对偏差的依赖，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽然允许专家干预预测，但无法解决模型与专家推理之间的系统性偏差问题，如从有偏数据中学习的捷径。

Method: 提出了一个两步骤的调试框架：1. 移除步骤，专家通过概念解释识别并移除不良概念；2. 重新训练步骤，使用CBDebug方法将概念级反馈转化为样本级辅助标签，用于监督偏差缓解和定向增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构（PIP-Net、Post-hoc CBM）和已知虚假相关性的基准测试中，显著优于先前的重新训练方法。

Conclusion: CBDebug框架通过结合专家反馈和监督偏差缓解方法，显著提升了概念瓶颈模型的性能，减少了其对不良概念的依赖。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Method: 该工具结合了深度学习模型和数据预处理技术，包括自动预处理测深数据、执行深度学习推理、阈值化模型输出，并生成沉船的像素级分割掩码或边界框。模型训练使用了来自五大湖和爱尔兰海岸的真实沉船数据，并通过合成数据生成增加数据多样性和规模。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder是一个开源的QGIS插件，能够通过深度学习模型自动检测多波束声纳数据中的沉船，显著提高了沉船检测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

TL;DR: 研究发现，适度剪枝可提升模型解释性，但过度剪枝会损害语义一致性，尽管准确性不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究剪枝对模型可解释性的影响，尤其是基于幅度的剪枝后微调对低层显著性图和高层概念表征的作用。

Method: 使用ResNet-18在ImageNette上进行训练，采用基于幅度的剪枝后微调，比较Vanilla Gradients (VG)和Integrated Gradients (IG)的后验解释，评估稀疏性和忠实度。并应用CRAFT-based概念提取来追踪学习概念的语义一致性变化。

Result: 研究表明，轻度到中度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，同时保留语义明确的概念；而过度剪枝会合并异质特征，降低显著性图的稀疏性和概念一致性，尽管准确性不受影响。

Conclusion: 轻度到中度剪枝可以提升显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，同时保留语义上有意义的概念；而过度剪枝则会合并异质特征，降低显著性图的稀疏性和概念一致性，尽管仍能保持准确性。这表明剪枝可以塑造内部表征以更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

TL;DR: TUN3D是一种新型方法，首次在仅需多视图图像输入的情况下实现联合布局估计和3D物体检测，无需深度传感器或相机姿态信息，性能达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常依赖点云输入，但大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，视觉数据更为常见。TUN3D旨在解决这一问题，首次在真实扫描中实现联合布局估计和3D物体检测，仅需多视图图像输入，且不需要真实相机姿态或深度监督。

Method: TUN3D基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，采用两个专用头部：一个用于3D物体检测，另一个用于布局估计，并利用新颖有效的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: TUN3D在三个场景理解基准测试中均表现优异：（i）使用真实点云，（ii）使用姿态图像，（iii）使用无姿态图像。

Conclusion: TUN3D在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准测试中均达到了最先进的性能，不仅与专门的3D物体检测方法表现相当，还在布局估计方面取得了显著进展，为整体室内场景理解设定了新标准。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视图像不同区域的重要性差异，可能影响视觉关键内容的重建质量，因此需要一种能细化语义粒度并优化资源利用的系统。

Method: 系统采用图像导向的语义编码器处理关键区域，非关键区域则通过图像到文本建模方法压缩，并结合模型量化和低秩适应微调技术实现轻量级部署。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该系统在语义保真度和视觉质量上均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的生成语义通信系统通过区分图像的关键和非关键区域，结合轻量级部署策略，显著提升了图像传输的语义保真度和视觉质量，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的骨架化尺度空间框架，通过稀疏化和密集化实现了形状的层次化简化，不仅满足关键的尺度空间属性，还能应用于实际任务如稳健骨架化、形状压缩和增材制造的刚度增强。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型能够在不增加气候指标误差的情况下，将气候预测降尺度至1公里分辨率，解决了现有气候预测空间分辨率低的问题。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Conclusion: 本研究强调了基于图像的越狱攻击的实际挑战，以及为视觉语言模型（VLMs）开发高效防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Result: 最先进的深度学习模型性能已接近最先进的人类专家水平。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在植物和动物自动识别方面的表现已接近人类专家水平。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

Method: DyME框架训练轻量级、特定概念的LoRA适配器，并在推理时动态组合所需适配器。为解决适配器间的干扰，引入了特征和参数层次的双层次正交性约束。

Result: 在ErasureBench-H和标准数据集上的实验表明，DyME在多概念擦除中表现优于现有基线方法，擦除保真度更高且非目标内容退化更少。

Conclusion: DyME通过动态组合轻量级LoRA适配器，结合双层次正交性约束，有效解决了多概念擦除中的干扰问题，显著提高了擦除保真度并减少了非目标内容的退化。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专用于评估视频理解模型输出的MLLM，其7B版本在多数基准测试中优于更大的基线模型，证明了视频输入对评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore）无法捕捉人类判断的精细度，而人工评估成本高昂。MLLM在视频理解评估中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过生成器与评估器的交互训练方法，即生成器根据目标评分生成响应，评估器筛选不匹配的响应。

Result: VideoJudge-7B在四个基准测试中的三个中表现优于更大的MLLM基线模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 32B和72B），且LLM评估器（如Qwen3）表现不如MLLM评估器。

Conclusion: VideoJudge-7B在三个基准测试中表现优于更大的MLLM基线模型，证明了其在视频理解评估任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom is a learned feature codec for CP, compressing features via RVQ to reduce bandwidth usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication bandwidth constraints scalability in multi-agent collaborative perception (CP).

Method: ReVQom is an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ), transmitting only per-pixel code indices.

Result: ReVQom achieves 273x to 1365x compression (6-30 bpp) with minimal accuracy loss, matching or outperforming raw-feature CP at 18 bpp.

Conclusion: ReVQom enables efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception, advancing practical V2X deployment.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现主流AI模型在生成沙特职业图像时存在严重的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，呼吁更多样化的训练数据和公平算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业图像时，是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性。

Method: 分析了ImageFX、DALL-E V3和Grok生成的1,006张图像，涉及56种沙特职业，使用中性提示。两名训练有素的沙特注释员评估了每张图像的五个维度：感知性别、服装和外观、背景和设置、活动和互动以及年龄。第三位资深研究员在两位主要评分者意见不一致时进行裁决，共产生10,100个独立判断。

Result: 结果显示强烈的性别失衡，ImageFX输出85%为男性，Grok为86.6%，DALL-E V3为96%，表明DALL-E V3表现出最强的性别刻板印象。这种失衡在领导和技术角色中尤为明显。此外，所有三个模型在服装、设置和活动方面经常出现文化不准确性。反刻板印象的图像通常源于文化误解而非真正的进步描绘。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在生成图像时反映了其训练数据中嵌入的社会偏见，仅有限地反映了沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别。这些发现强调了急需更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评价框架，以确保视觉输出的公平性和真实性。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别短视频平台中的不当内容日益重要，现有方法需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入了三种针对性的预训练任务：Caption（增强对视频细节的感知）、VQA（加深对问题定义和标注指南的理解）和CoT（增强推理能力）。

Result: 实验结果表明，预训练方法显著提升了MLLM的性能，并在新兴问题上展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的预训练方法显著提升了多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在零样本和有监督微调（SFT）设置下的性能，并展现出对新兴、未见问题的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: GUI-Cursor通过交互式搜索和强化学习，显著提升GUI定位准确率，适应复杂场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在高分辨率GUI图像上预测坐标不准确的问题。

Method: 使用多步在线强化学习与基于轨迹的密集奖励函数训练GUI-Cursor模型。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上分别将准确率提升至93.9%和56.5%，且95%的案例仅需两步即可解决。

Conclusion: GUI-Cursor通过交互式搜索任务重新定义了GUI基础问题，采用强化学习训练，显著提高了定位准确率，并在复杂案例中展现出适应性。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统依赖嵌入模型和余弦相似度排序，存在两个问题：(1) 低质量文本-视频数据对难以识别和检查；(2) 余弦相似度缺乏解释性。

Method: 提出 X-CoT 框架，利用 LLM CoT 推理替代传统的嵌入模型相似度排序，包括扩展基准数据集以支持语义理解和减少数据偏差，并设计检索 CoT 步骤（成对比较）生成详细推理和完整排序。

Result: X-CoT 在实验中提升了检索性能，生成详细推理依据，并支持模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT 通过引入 LLM CoT 推理框架，显著提升了文本-视频检索的性能，并提供了详细的解释性分析，有助于模型行为和数据质量评估。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Conclusion: 通过整合背景掩码、基于补丁的分析策略和高效的领域适应，提出的方法克服了现有方法的局限性，能够可靠地检测手术器械图像中的细粒度缺陷。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上的实验表明，该方法在更细粒度的地理定位任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过整合空间先验的对比学习策略，显著提高了基于图像的全球地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度上。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive

Conclusion: 尽管当前最先进的视频生成器被视为世界模型，但在从单张图像预测运动方面仍存在困难，尤其是在简单的物理场景中。研究表明，这种限制源于生成像素的间接性，而非直接建模运动。提出的方法在模拟数据和真实世界直觉物理数据集上均显示出更高的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Method: 通过UCF Sports数据集对DINOv3和V-JEPA2两种自监督学习架构进行多维度评估，包括分类准确性、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分能力。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（Silhouette得分：0.31 vs 0.21）和姿势识别动作上表现优异，而V-JEPA2在所有动作类型中表现稳定且性能方差较低（0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频分析系统中架构设计选择的重要性，并提供了基于任务需求和可靠性约束选择适当特征提取方法的实证指导。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

TL;DR: 该论文通过表征相似性度量和SNF方法，揭示了视觉模型家族间的共享和独特计算策略，展示了架构和训练目标如何共同塑造表征结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来区分其表征中的共享和独特计算策略。

Method: 利用一套表征相似性度量（如RSA、Soft Matching和Linear Predictivity），并采用Similarity Network Fusion（SNF）方法整合这些度量。

Result: 几何和调谐携带家族特定特征，而线性可解码信息更广泛共享；SNF实现了比任何单一度量更强的家族分离，并揭示了监督模型和自监督模型的聚类模式。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个基于生物学启发的框架，用于对视觉模型进行分类，表明由架构和训练目标共同塑造的新兴计算策略定义了超越表面设计类别的表征结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

TL;DR: FantasyWorld框架通过几何分支增强视频基础模型，实现3D感知视频生成，提升多视角一致性和下游任务适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏显式3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。

Method: 提出FantasyWorld框架，结合冻结的视频基础模型和可训练的几何分支，通过跨分支监督实现视频潜变量和隐式3D场的联合建模。

Result: FantasyWorld在多视角一致性和风格一致性上优于现有几何一致基线，实验验证了统一主干和跨分支信息交换的有效性。

Conclusion: FantasyWorld通过统一的框架和跨分支信息交换，有效提升了3D感知视频生成的质量，为下游3D任务提供了通用表示。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理异构PDE数据，通过创新架构在多项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决异构时空数据和多物理场建模的挑战，MORPH旨在提供一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，以捕捉局部和全局相互作用。

Method: MORPH基于卷积视觉变换器架构，结合了组件级卷积、跨场交叉注意力和轴向注意力机制，以处理不同维度和分辨率的时空数据。

Result: MORPH在零样本和全样本泛化任务中表现优于从头训练的模型，并在多项评估中匹配或超越了现有基准和最先进模型。

Conclusion: MORPH模型通过其灵活的架构和高效的学习能力，为科学机器学习提供了一个可扩展且数据高效的基础框架，能够处理异构和多模态的科学观测数据。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外成像在低光和恶劣天气条件下物体检测的挑战，如类别不平衡、热噪声和计算限制。

Method: 通过替换 YOLOv8 的 CSPDarknet 主干网络为更高效的 MobileNetV4，并引入 SlideLoss 损失函数，动态强调未被充分代表和被遮挡的样本。

Result: 在 FLIR ADAS V2 基准测试中，MS-YOLO 取得了竞争力的 mAP 和更高的精度，仅需 6.7 GFLOPs。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO 在保持高检测质量的同时显著降低了计算成本，适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署。

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

TL;DR: MATR通过显式预测对象运动减少查询冲突，显著提升多目标跟踪性能，在多个数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based框架在单一Transformer Decoder层中联合处理检测和跟踪查询，导致冲突和关联精度下降。

Method: 提出Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，通过显式预测对象运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突。

Result: 在DanceTrack、SportsMOT和BDD100k数据集上，MATR显著提升了性能指标，如DanceTrack上HOTA提高9分以上，并在多个数据集上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MATR通过显式建模运动信息，在端到端Transformer框架中提供了一种简单而高效的方法，显著提升了多目标跟踪的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种基于Lie群微分偏差的视频去雨方法，通过几何一致性对齐和速度估计，有效提升去雨效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野外拍摄的视频常受雨纹、模糊和噪声干扰，且相机姿态微小变化会加剧帧间不匹配和时域伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且不够鲁棒。

Method: DeLiVR通过两个互补组件实现：旋转有界的Lie相对偏差和差分群位移，前者预测帧内角度以实现几何一致性对齐，后者计算相邻帧间角度差以估计速度。

Result: DeLiVR在公开基准测试中展现出高效和鲁棒的去雨效果。

Conclusion: DeLiVR通过引入Lie群微分偏差，有效提升了视频去雨方法的效率和鲁棒性，实验结果表明其在公开基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

Motivation: 受自然图像领域巨大进展的启发，尤其是通过自监督学习（SSL）训练的模型在有限标注数据下的强大适应性和特征可迁移性，作者希望将这一技术应用于SAR领域。

Method: 实验首先测试了当前最强大的视觉基础模型（如DINOv2、DINOv3和PE-Core），发现其直接应用于SAR目标特征提取时存在不足。随后，通过自监督微调公开可用的SSL模型与SAR数据，训练了多个AFRL-DINOv2模型，显著超越了当前最佳SAR域模型SARATR-X。

Result: 通过自监督微调公开SSL模型与SAR数据，训练的AFRL-DINOv2模型显著超越了当前最佳SAR域模型SARATR-X，并分析了不同骨干网络和下游任务适应配方的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 尽管本研究在SAR基础模型方面取得了积极成果，但仍有许多工作有待完成，希望这项工作能为未来的SAR基础模型建设者提供信息和启发。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 UI 测试和 AI 代理训练方法依赖于笨重的物理设备或静态截图分析，难以应对动态多样的移动环境，限制了可扩展性和智能 UI 代理的开发。

Method: UISim 采用两阶段方法：首先根据初始手机屏幕图像和用户操作预测下一个 UI 状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测的布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，UISim 在生成真实且连贯的后续 UI 状态方面优于端到端 UI 生成基线，展现了其高保真度和潜力。

Conclusion: UISim 通过其动态和交互式的图像模拟能力，显著提升了 UI 测试、原型设计及合成数据生成的效率，并为 AI 代理的 UI 导航任务规划提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to

Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，并忽视了情感标签的语义信息对情绪理解的贡献。

Method: 框架包含视觉上下文编码模块和情绪语义编码模块，前者利用多尺度场景信息编码个体关系，后者利用大语言模型生成情感词汇并通过结构化情感树精炼成全面的语义表示。相似性感知交互用于对齐和整合视觉与语义信息。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过整合视觉场景上下文和标签引导的语义信息，显著提升了群体情绪识别（GER）的性能，并在三个广泛使用的数据集上取得了具有竞争力的结果。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: KG-SAM被证明是一个强大且可推广的框架，能够显著提升医学图像分割的效果，特别是在处理模糊边界和不确定性量化方面。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute

rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

*Lan Chen,Yuchao Gu,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVid通过微调预训练视频生成模型，以视觉句子形式统一处理多样化视觉任务，展示了无需任务特定修改的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练视频生成模型是否能适应多样化的图像和视频任务，以克服现有方法（如LVM）需要跨模态和跨源任务特定预训练的高成本和可扩展性限制。

Method: UniVid框架通过微调视频扩散变换器（video diffusion transformer），将任务表示为视觉句子，其中上下文序列定义了任务和预期输出模态。

Result: UniVid在跨模态推理（混合图像和视频上下文）和跨源任务（从自然数据到标注数据）中表现出良好的泛化能力，且理解与生成任务可通过简单反转视觉句子顺序切换。

Conclusion: 预训练的视频生成模型（如UniVid）展示了作为可扩展且统一的视觉建模基础的潜力，能够适应多样化的图像和视频任务，而无需任务特定的修改或多源预训练。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间结构的令牌合并方法，兼容现代ViT架构，在多种任务中实现高效加速且性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT主干架构的空间设计对令牌减少提出了新挑战，现有方法大多无法保持这些架构依赖的空间结构。

Method: 采用2D减少策略、空间感知合并算法和最大幅度每维度令牌表示，以保持空间结构和突出特征。

Result: 在SAM-H上实现了1.25倍加速且COCO评估的mIOU仅下降0.7%，在DeiT-B上1.15倍加速且ImageNet的top-1准确率无下降。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种简单有效的令牌合并方法，能够在保持空间完整性的同时与现代ViT主干架构兼容，实现了在多种视觉任务上的最先进性能。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GASP-ICL框架在无需微调大型视觉语言模型的情况下，显著提升了多模态深度伪造检测的性能，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ProDA框架通过解耦多动作场景中的指定动作，显著提升了视频动作识别的性能。实验证明其优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式语义记忆，导致空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀，影响了导航效率。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出了JanusVLN框架。

Method: 通过结合空间几何编码器和视觉语义编码器，构建双隐式神经记忆，避免了冗余计算，实现了高效的增量更新。

Conclusion: JanusVLN提出了一种新型的双隐式神经记忆框架，显著提升了视觉与语言导航任务的性能，为未来研究探索了新的方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but

In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for

innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a

approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架在跨图像推理任务中实现了最先进的性能，达到了64.82%的准确率，比之前的最佳方法提高了1%。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Conclusion: LongScape框架通过结合扩散去噪和自回归因果生成，实现了稳定且一致的长时程视频生成，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

Conclusion: DiTraj 是一种简单但高效的无训练框架，专为 DiT 设计，用于文本到视频生成中的轨迹控制。通过前景-背景分离引导和 STD-RoPE 方法，显著提升了视频质量和轨迹可控性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对静态场景，而现实场景常包含动态元素（如移动物体、光照变化等），因此需要一种能够联合建模时间辐射变化和3D转换的方法。

Method: 提出HDR-4DGS，一种基于高斯泼溅的架构，配备动态色调映射模块，明确连接HDR和LDR域，并根据时间维度上的辐射分布动态调整色调映射功能。

Result: HDR-4DGS在任意视角和时间实例下实现逼真的HDR渲染，实验证明其在定量和视觉性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HDR-4DGS通过创新的动态色调映射模块，实现了时间辐射一致性和空间准确的色彩转换，在定量性能和视觉保真度上均超越现有最先进方法。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Conclusion: SRHand通过结合隐式图像表示和显式手部网格，显著提升了低分辨率图像下的3D手部重建质量，尤其在细节（如皱纹、指甲）方面表现优异。

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在美学评估中因数据稀缺和主观性导致的准确性和可解释性问题。

Method: 提出了Aes-R1框架，包括AesCoT管道用于构建和过滤高质量的美学推理数据，以及RAPO算法联合优化绝对评分回归和相对排名顺序。

Result: 实验表明，Aes-R1将基础模型的平均PLCC/SRCC提升了47.9%/34.8%，超越同类先进基线。消融研究验证了其在有限监督和分布外场景中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Aes-R1通过结合强化学习和高质量的美学推理数据，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在美学评分和推理方面的性能，表现出色且具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉配音方法中音频驱动范式无法捕捉说话者特定唇部习惯，以及传统修复方法在处理遮挡时产生视觉伪影的问题。

Method: 基于Stable-Diffusion框架，开发了唇部习惯调制机制和遮挡感知训练策略，并引入混合Mamba-Transformer架构以优化训练效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，StableDub在唇部习惯相似性、遮挡鲁棒性、音频-唇部同步、视频质量和分辨率一致性方面均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: StableDub通过整合唇部习惯感知建模与遮挡鲁棒合成，显著提升了视觉配音任务的性能，尤其在唇部习惯相似性和遮挡鲁棒性方面表现卓越。

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决文本驱动的3D场景生成中物体运动控制的不足，Drag4D旨在提供一个交互式框架，使用户能够定义3D轨迹并实现高质量集成。

Method: 1. 使用2D高斯泼溅和全景图像增强文本到3D背景生成；2. 通过3D复制粘贴方法将目标物体提取为完整3D网格并合成到场景中；3. 开发部分增强的运动条件视频扩散模型以实现时间对齐。

Result: Drag4D实现了物体在3D场景中的精确空间对齐和时间动画，展示了其统一架构的有效性。

Conclusion: Drag4D框架通过三阶段流程成功实现了用户控制的3D物体运动与高质量3D背景的无缝集成，展示了统一架构的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频到视频（A2V）模型在细粒度同步方面表现不佳，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，因此探索更精确的同步方法是必要的。

Method: Syncphony基于预训练的视频骨干网络，结合Motion-aware Loss和Audio Sync Guidance，优化音频与视频的同步。

Result: Syncphony在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上表现出更高的同步精度和视觉质量。

Conclusion: Syncphony在音频到视频生成中通过引入Motion-aware Loss和Audio Sync Guidance，显著提升了同步精度和视觉质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: LG-CD模型通过结合视觉与文本信息，显著提升了变化检测性能，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的变化检测方法主要关注单模态视觉信息，忽略了多模态数据（如文本）提供的丰富语义信息。为了解决这一局限性，作者提出了LG-CD模型，利用自然语言提示引导网络关注感兴趣区域。

Method: LG-CD模型利用视觉基础模型（SAM2）提取多尺度金字塔特征，通过多层适配器微调下游任务，设计了文本融合注意力模块（TFAM）对齐视觉与文本信息，并通过视觉-语义融合解码器（V-SFD）深度整合两者信息生成高精度变化检测掩码。

Result: 在LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD三个数据集上的实验表明，LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods。

Conclusion: LG-CD模型通过结合多模态信息（视觉与文本），显著提升了变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性，并在三个数据集上优于现有方法。此外，该方法为利用多模态信息实现广义变化检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

Motivation: 现有文本驱动和拖拽驱动的图像编辑方法各有局限性：文本驱动缺乏精确空间控制，拖拽驱动缺乏细粒度纹理引导。本文旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散的统一框架，包含两个关键创新：点云确定性拖拽（增强潜在空间布局控制）和拖拽-文本引导去噪（动态平衡拖拽和文本条件的影响）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在联合编辑任务中表现优异，且与单一文本或拖拽方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的统一扩散框架在图像编辑中结合了文本和拖拽互动的优势，不仅实现了高保真的联合编辑，还在单独文本或拖拽条件下表现出色，为可控图像操作提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Conclusion: 提出的sideload-CL-adaptation框架通过对比学习预训练和轻量级模型微调，显著提升了北欧地区雪覆盖环境下无人机图像中车辆检测的性能。

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

Method: 提出了 IF-V2V，一种无需反转的方法，通过向量场校正与样本偏差、结构运动保持初始化以及偏差缓存机制，适应现成的基于流匹配的 I2V 模型。

Result: 评估表明，该方法在编辑质量和一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IF-V2V 提供了一种轻量级的即插即用解决方案，显著提升了视频编辑的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

Motivation: 大多数多视角计数方法依赖全监督学习，需要大量标注数据，限制了其应用。

Method: 利用神经体积渲染学习场景的隐式表示，重建连续几何形状和复杂的、视图依赖的2D投影外观。

Result: SSLCounter在多个MVC基准测试中不仅达到最先进性能，而且仅使用70%的训练数据就能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: SSLCounter作为一种自监督学习框架，通过神经体积渲染减少对大规模标注数据的依赖，在MVC任务中表现出色，且数据效率高。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

Method: 通过一个受控的合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型和大规模视觉语言模型在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务。

Result: 研究发现，检测器如GroundingDINO和OWLv2在精确定位方面表现良好但在关系推理上有限，而视觉语言模型如SmolVLM和GPT-4o能提供粗略的布局线索和流畅的描述但在细粒度空间上下文上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 本文强调了当前视觉基础模型在空间理解上的不足，并指出社区需要开发更具空间感知能力的模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

Motivation: 解决视觉上下文学习中对单一上下文配对的过度依赖问题，避免由此导致的偏见和不稳定预测。

Method: PANICL采用基于补丁的k近邻视觉上下文学习方法，平滑分配分数，无需额外训练即可减少偏见。

Result: 在多种视觉任务中，PANICL均表现出优于基线模型的性能，并对领域偏移表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PANICL通过利用多个上下文配对的图像，减少了视觉上下文学习中的偏见和不稳定性，并在多种视觉任务中表现出色，具有广泛的适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖深度传感器或在低光/无纹理场景中性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出token-scaler-based微调机制和深度感知匹配过程，结合Depth-Anything v2和LoFTR。

Result: 在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上平均召回率提升6.1%，深度预测性能提升14.41%。

Conclusion: SingRef6D通过单RGB图像参考和深度感知匹配，显著提升了6D姿态估计的鲁棒性和性能，尤其在资源有限或挑战性场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在深度图、边缘图和人体骨架等多种条件下，对松散对齐的视觉条件均能提升性能，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SemanticControl通过自适应地抑制视觉条件与文本提示冲突部分的影响，同时增强文本引导，有效解决了现有ControlNet模型在视觉条件与目标提示不对齐时的性能问题。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

Method: 提出情感陈述判断任务及自动化流程，高效构建情感中心化陈述，减少人工标注负担。

Result: 主流MLLMs在情感解释和上下文情感判断表现较强，但在感知主观性理解上相对受限，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 本研究通过提出情感陈述判断任务及自动化流程，系统评估了主流MLLMs在情感解释和基于上下文的情感判断方面的表现，揭示了其在感知主观性理解上的局限性，并指出了未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Motivation: 现有方法依赖简单的基于重建的目标，导致属性泄漏和与人类偏好不一致。

Method: 引入显式位置监督以减少属性泄漏，采用Mixture-of-Experts架构增强模型能力，设计在线强化学习框架以对齐人类偏好。

Result: 实验验证了框架在主题保真度和人类偏好对齐方面的显著改进。

Conclusion: MultiCrafter框架显著提高了主题保真度，并更好地与人类偏好对齐。

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

Motivation: 现有的开放世界部分分割方法依赖2D基础模型的间接监督，无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解有限、分解不可控和泛化能力不足。

Method: PartSAM采用基于triplane的双分支编码器-解码器架构，结合模型在环标注流程，从在线资源中筛选出超过五百万个3D形状-部分对进行训练。

Result: PartSAM在多个基准测试中大幅优于现有方法，能够通过单一提示实现高精度部分识别，并在Segment-Every-Part模式下自动分解形状为表面和内部结构。

Conclusion: PartSAM通过其可扩展的架构和多样化的3D数据，显著提升了3D部分分割的准确性和泛化能力，标志着3D部分理解基础模型的重要进展。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于深度学习的无参考对比质量评估方法，通过微调预训练模型并引入对比感知回归头，在多个数据集上取得了最优性能，证明了其在实时和资源受限应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像对比度是视觉感知的基本因素，对整体图像质量至关重要。然而，大多数无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）模型难以在多样化的真实条件下准确评估对比度失真。

Method: 本研究提出了一种基于深度学习的框架，通过定制和微调三种预训练架构（EfficientNet B0、ResNet18和MobileNetV2）以及一个基于Siamese网络的模型，用于感知平均意见分数（MOS）评估。模型采用对比感知回归头，并在两个基准数据集（CID2013和CCID2014）上进行了端到端训练。

Result: 定制化的EfficientNet B0模型在CCID2014和CID2013数据集上取得了最先进的性能（PLCC = 0.9286/0.9581，SRCC = 0.9178/0.9369），优于传统方法和其他深度基线。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过对轻量级预训练网络进行对比感知适配，可以开发出高性能、可扩展的无参考对比质量评估方案，适用于实时和资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast

Method: 提出Geo-R1，一种基于强化微调（RFT）的范式，首先生成显式、可解释的推理链分解指代表达，再利用这些理性定位目标对象。

Result: 在三个少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1显著优于SFT基线，并展现出强健的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过其‘先推理后行动’的RFT范式，在少样本地理空间指代表达理解任务中显著优于传统SFT方法，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

Conclusion: 该研究提出了VIPER框架，有效减少了医疗视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的谄媚行为，为实际临床应用中部署稳健的VLM奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

TL;DR: GLARIFY是一种利用时空注视信息增强视觉语言模型在现实应用中效果的新方法，通过处理噪声注视模式和融入热图模块，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户的注意力被整合到视觉语言模型（VLMs）中以简化日常场景中的多模态查询。然而，利用注视数据建模用户注意力可能引入模糊性挑战：（1）用户的口头问题因使用代词或跳过上下文而变得模糊；（2）人类的注视模式可能是噪声且与口头问题表现出复杂的时空关系。先前的工作仅考虑单张图像作为视觉模态输入，未能捕捉用户注意力的动态特性。

Method: 研究首先分析了数百个带有注视模态的查询样本，证明了用户注视模式的噪声性质。随后利用GPT-4o设计了一个自动数据合成流程，生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，并包含专门的链式思考（CoT）过程来处理噪声注视模式。最后设计了一个热图模块，将注视信息融入前沿的视觉语言模型，同时保留其预训练知识。

Result: 实验表明，GLARIFY在保留测试集上的表现显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GLARIFY通过将视觉语言模型与人类注意力稳健对齐，为视觉助手提供了一种可用且直观的交互范式。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在多模态任务中表现优异，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未充分理解，尤其是关键视觉信息在不同位置时模型的输出不一致问题。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集，分析了LVLMs的空间偏差，并提出Balanced Position Assignment（BaPA）机制。

Result: 实验表明，BaPA不仅提升了LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，还通过轻量级微调进一步提高了多模态任务性能。

Conclusion: BaPA机制通过为所有图像令牌分配相同的位置嵌入，显著提升了LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，且无需重新训练。结合轻量级微调后，还能进一步提升多模态任务性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法首次支持对主体驱动生成中的不一致性进行量化和定位，为该任务的推进提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Conclusion: ERGO提出了一种高效的两阶段推理管道，通过结合推理驱动的感知方法，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了高精度。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like

prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的DFF方法在复杂场景（如细微纹理或深度突变）中表现不佳，焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。DualFocus旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DualFocus采用变分公式，结合空间约束和焦距约束，利用焦点堆栈中的梯度模式变化来区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，DualFocus在深度准确性和感知质量上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DualFocus通过结合空间和焦距维度的双重约束，显著提升了深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

*Genjia Liu,Anning Hu,Yue Hu,Wenjun Zhang,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于信息论的RDcomm框架，优化多智能体协作中的通信效率，显著减少通信量并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在任务性能与通信量之间的权衡上缺乏理论基础，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 论文提出了RDcomm框架，包括任务熵离散编码和互信息驱动的信息选择，以优化通信策略。

Result: RDcomm在3D目标检测和BEV分割任务上达到了最先进的精度，同时将通信量减少了高达108倍。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入基于信息论的速率-失真理论，为多智能体协作中的性能-通信权衡提供了理论基础，并提出了RDcomm框架，显著提升了通信效率。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

TL;DR: FailureAtlas是一个主动探索框架，用于大规模发现和诊断Text-to-Image模型的系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准测试在诊断T2I模型的系统性失败方面能力有限，需要一种主动探索的方法来更全面地识别失败原因。

Method: FailureAtlas将错误发现构建为一个结构化搜索问题，使用新颖的加速技术解决计算爆炸问题。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion模型上应用时，发现了超过247,000个未知错误切片，并证明这些失败与训练数据稀缺有关。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas为生成AI的稳健性开发提供了一种新的、诊断优先的方法论。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的自监督方法，通过幻觉放大机制和双锚点策略减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象，实验证明其有效性和跨架构泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但容易产生与视觉证据不一致的幻觉内容，现有方法往往需要额外微调或牺牲信息量和可扩展性。

Method: 提出了一种基于文本到图像模型的幻觉放大机制，通过将生成的描述投影到视觉空间以揭示隐含的幻觉信号，利用正负双锚点对解码器隐藏状态进行编辑。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中显著减少了幻觉现象（如CHAIR上降低超过5%），同时保持了模型性能，且无需额外训练成本，具有跨架构的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种无需训练的自监督方法来减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉现象，该方法通过引入幻觉放大机制和双锚点策略，显著降低了幻觉发生率，同时保持了模型的召回率和描述丰富性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 解决条件图像生成模型在边缘设备上部署时的高资源需求和标注数据稀缺问题，降低成本和隐私风险。

Method: 提出Refine-Control，一种半监督蒸馏框架，引入三层次知识融合损失来提升学生模型性能，并利用标记和未标记数据增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，Refine-Control在计算成本和延迟方面有显著改进，同时保持了高保真生成能力和可控性。

Conclusion: Refine-Control框架通过半监督蒸馏方法显著降低了计算成本和延迟，同时保持了高质量的图像生成能力和可控性。

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知的三阶段迭代方法，提升了视觉语言模型在复杂输入下的推理性能，实验显示性能提升3.1-5.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在面对复杂和冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，导致无关推理或幻觉，需要一种更精准的区域发现和处理方法。

Method: CoFFT是一种无需训练的方法，包含三个阶段：(1) 多样化样本生成，(2) 双重前瞻解码，(3) 视觉焦点调整，通过迭代循环优化推理和视觉焦点。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next等模型上，CoFFT在多个基准测试中性能提升3.1-5.8%，且计算开销可控。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知，显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂和冗余视觉输入下的推理能力，实验证明其在多个基准测试中性能提升3.1-5.8%。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个面对面教学视频数据集，并展示了多模态大型语言模型在该场景中的优越性能，为教学互动的全面理解提供了新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对面教学场景在计算机视觉领域尚未得到系统研究，主要原因是缺乏合适的数据集和有限的分析技术。

Method: 提出了一个新的以自我为中心的面对面教学视频数据集，并标注了两个基本任务的真实数据：程序步骤分割和对话状态分类。通过该数据集，对多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）与传统任务特定模型进行了基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs即使在没有任务特定微调的情况下，也能超越专业基线模型。

Conclusion: 多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在未进行任务特定微调的情况下，已经表现出对面对面教学场景的全面理解潜力，超越了专业基线模型。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的框架，通过预训练的2D分割模型和视觉语言模型提升3D高斯场景的开放词汇理解，显著减少场景适应时间并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：(i)依赖昂贵的每场景重新训练；(ii)限制性的单义设计无法表示复杂、多概念的语义；(iii)跨视图语义不一致性易损最终的语义表示。MUSplat旨在克服这些限制。

Method: MUSplat利用预训练的2D分割模型生成并提升多粒度2D掩码到3D中，估计每个高斯点的前景概率以形成初始对象组，然后通过语义熵和几何不透明度优化这些初始组的模糊边界，最后通过视觉语言模型（VLM）解释对象在其最具代表性视角下的外观，提炼出鲁棒的文本特征以实现开放词汇查询。

Result: MUSplat在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割的基准任务中表现优于现有的基于训练的框架，同时解决了它们的单义限制。

Conclusion: MUSplat通过消除昂贵的每场景训练过程，将场景适应时间从几小时缩短到几分钟，并在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割的基准任务中表现优于现有的基于训练的框架。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

TL;DR: DAVIS是一个基于扩散模型的音频-视觉分离框架，通过生成建模直接合成分离后的声音频谱，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于掩码回归，难以捕捉复杂数据分布以实现高质量声音分离，DAVIS通过生成建模解决这一问题。

Method: DAVIS采用Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)和Flow Matching (FM)结合Separation U-Net架构，直接从噪声分布生成分离后的声音频谱。

Result: 在AVE和MUSIC数据集上，DAVIS的DDPM和FM变体均优于现有方法，分离质量更高。

Conclusion: DAVIS框架通过生成建模范式（DDPM和FM）在音频-视觉分离任务中表现出色，超越了现有方法，展示了生成模型在此类任务中的高效性。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Motivation: 现有医学数据集过于关注分类准确性，导致模型在临床推理任务中的真实能力被高估，因此需要设计一个专注于深度推理的紧凑型基准来弥补这一不足。

Method: 研究开发了Neural-MedBench，结合多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记，设计了三个核心任务家族，并采用混合评分流程（LLM评分、临床医生验证和语义相似度指标）进行可靠评估。

Result: 对包括GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma在内的先进视觉语言模型的评估显示，与传统数据集相比，这些模型在Neural-MedBench上的表现显著下降，错误分析表明推理失败是主要原因。

Conclusion: 论文提出了Neural-MedBench作为评估多模态临床推理能力的紧凑型基准，并通过系统评估揭示了当前视觉语言模型在深度推理任务上的不足，强调了广度与深度评估框架的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 由于GAN和扩散模型生成的内容越来越真实，现有方法在空间或频域特征上的单一关注限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出Spectral Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet)，包含Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)和Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)模块，通过局部空间分支和全局频谱分支联合捕捉异常。

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中，SpecXNet实现了最先进的准确率，特别是在跨数据集和未见过的篡改场景下。

Conclusion: SpecXNet通过结合空间和频谱双域特征，实现了鲁棒且可泛化的深度伪造检测，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的准确率。

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Conclusion: MGM框架通过生成具有PBR材料属性的高质量3D内容，显著提升了材料建模的视觉效果，并支持实际的下游渲染应用。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种通过分割有害叙事为多个无害场景的黑盒越狱方法，显著提高了T2V模型的攻击成功率，揭示了当前安全机制的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着T2V模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。尽管已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和T2I模型的漏洞，但T2V模型的安全性仍未被充分研究，存在显著的安全空白。

Method: 提出SceneSplit，一种新颖的黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害叙事分割为多个独立无害的场景，利用场景组合作为约束来引导生成有害视频。核心机制通过迭代场景操纵进一步增强，绕过安全过滤器。

Result: 在11个安全类别上评估SceneSplit，结果显示其在Luma Ray2、Hailuo和Veo2上的平均攻击成功率（ASR）分别为77.2%、84.1%和78.2%，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 当前T2V模型的安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构的攻击，为理解和改进T2V模型的安全性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新颖的自监督点云补全方法，通过多视角增强和引入Mamba模型，显著提升了补全质量，并在合成和真实数据集上达到了最先进的效果。

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但在使用较少神经功能评估（NFEs）或较低引导尺度时，输出仍可能显得不真实且缺乏细节。

Method: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术——历史引导采样（HiGS），通过将近期模型预测整合到每个推理步骤中，优化采样过程。

Result: 实验表明，HiGS在不同模型和架构下均能提升图像质量，并在预训练的SiT模型上实现了256×256 ImageNet无引导生成的最新FID 1.61（仅需30步采样）。

Conclusion: HiGS作为一种即插即用的增强技术，能够在不增加额外计算负担的情况下，显著提升扩散模型的图像生成质量与效率。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

Conclusion: MultiMat通过结合视觉和文本图表示的多模态程序合成框架，显著提升了程序性材料图的生成效率和视觉质量，超越了仅基于文本的基线方法。

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的MSEA和ARC方法在多模态大语言模型的解释性研究中表现优异，显著提升了模型行为的忠实性和细粒度解释能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

Conclusion: 该研究通过整合StyleGAN、DragGAN和PCA，显著提升了GAN生成图像的潜在空间效率和可控性，为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制方法。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex

that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

Conclusion: HERMAN方法通过利用LLMs生成层次化文本描述符并自适应匹配CLIP的多层次语义特征，在CIL任务中显著提升了性能，同时有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward是首个细粒度、时空感知的基准，用于标注人类感知的伪造痕迹，训练多模态语言模型模仿人类判断，在伪造检测任务上表现优于GPT-5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视频生成模型发展迅速，但人类是否能检测到生成的视频中的深度伪造痕迹（即时空基础的视觉伪影）这一关键维度被很大程度上忽视了。

Method: 研究者引入了DeeptraceReward基准，包含4.3K详细注释的3.3K高质量生成视频，并训练多模态语言模型（LMs）作为奖励模型来模仿人类的判断和定位。

Result: 在DeeptraceReward上，7B奖励模型在伪造线索识别、定位和解释方面平均比GPT-5高出34.7%。研究发现二元伪造与真实分类比细粒度的深度伪造痕迹检测更容易，而在后者中，性能从自然语言解释（最容易）到空间定位，再到时间标记（最难）逐渐下降。

Conclusion: DeeptraceReward通过提供细粒度的、空间和时间感知的基准，为视频生成奖励提供了严谨的测试平台和训练信号，促进了社会意识和可信的视频生成。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

TL;DR: FlashEdit通过OSIE、BG-Shield和SSCA三项创新技术，实现了高保真、实时的图像编辑，速度提升150倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑方法虽质量高，但延迟过高，阻碍实际应用。FlashEdit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FlashEdit采用三步创新技术：1) OSIE管线绕过高成本迭代过程；2) BG-Shield技术选择性修改编辑区域特征以保护背景；3) SSCA机制抑制语义泄漏至背景，确保局部编辑精确性。

Result: 实验表明FlashEdit在保持背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑速度提升超过150倍（0.2秒内完成）。

Conclusion: FlashEdit成功实现了高保真、实时的图像编辑，显著提升了处理速度，同时保持了背景一致性和结构完整性。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapRL是一种新颖的强化学习框架，通过重新定义字幕质量评估标准，显著提升了图像字幕任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有监督微调方法在图像字幕任务中依赖昂贵、不可扩展的人工标注数据，导致模型泛化能力差和多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提出了Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL)，一个基于强化学习和可验证奖励的两阶段训练框架，通过非视觉语言模型对字幕质量的评估来生成奖励。

Result: CapRL在12个基准测试中表现优异，在Prism Framework中的性能接近Qwen2.5-VL-72B，并平均超出基线8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL通过重新定义字幕质量，采用两阶段训练框架，显著提升了图像字幕任务的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著成果。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的数据采集和人工标注，而现有卫星方法存在数据遮挡、过时和向量化效率低的问题。UniMapGen旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: UniMapGen采用离散序列表示车道线，并引入多模态输入支持（BEV、PV和文本提示）以及状态更新策略，以优化地图向量生成。

Result: UniMapGen在OpenSatMap数据集上表现优异，能够推断被遮挡道路并预测缺失道路。

Conclusion: UniMapGen提出了一种创新的大规模地图构建框架，通过离散序列表示和多模态输入支持，显著提升了地图构建的完整性和连续性，并在OpenSatMap数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

TL;DR: GS-2M提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅的统一框架，联合优化网格重建和材质分解，有效处理高反射表面，结果与SOTA相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分开处理网格重建和材质分解任务，且难以处理高反射表面，常依赖外部模型先验。

Method: 基于3D高斯泼溅的统一框架，结合粗糙度监督策略和多视角光度变化，设计了精心优化的损失函数和优化过程。

Result: GS-2M在广泛使用的数据集上验证了其有效性，生成了可用于下游任务的三角形网格及其材质组件。

Conclusion: GS-2M通过联合优化深度和法线渲染相关的属性，能够在保持几何细节的同时有效处理高反射表面，其重建结果与现有最先进方法相当。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在文档分析领域并不常见，但其增强的推理能力可能对下游任务有益，因此研究了规则基础强化学习在文档图像分类中的效果。

Method: 研究者采用了规则基础的强化学习方法，并在文档图像分类任务中进行了测试，包括三种不同的分布外场景：不同图像、未见类别和不同模态。

Result: 研究发现，强化学习在分布外数据上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 规则基础的强化学习在文档图像分类任务中展现出优于传统方法的泛化能力，特别是在面对分布外数据时。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决轻量级3D医学图像分割在复杂解剖结构和异构模态下的效率与鲁棒性冲突问题。

Method: 采用双流CNN-Transformer架构，结合Paired Window Attention（PWA）和Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided卷积（JLC），并引入Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer（SDKT）技术。

Result: 在多种模态基准测试中，Dice系数提升26%，GPU吞吐量提高11倍，CPU提高48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg通过创新的双流CNN-Transformer架构和知识转移技术，显著提升了轻量级3D医学图像分割的效率和鲁棒性，且在多种模态下表现优异。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

TL;DR: RAPID3通过三层次强化加速策略，无需更新生成器即可实现图像级自适应加速，显著提升DiT采样速度（近3倍），保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速方法通常依赖统一启发式或手动设计的自适应策略，无法实现图像级自适应加速；动态神经网络虽能实现自适应加速，但微调成本高。

Method: 引入RAPID3框架，包含三个轻量级策略头（Step-Skip、Cache-Reuse、Sparse-Attention），通过GRPO在线训练策略参数，同时冻结生成器参数。

Result: 在包括Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX在内的先进DiT骨干上，RAPID3实现了近乎3倍的采样加速，且生成质量具有竞争力。

Conclusion: RAPID3框架通过三层次强化加速策略，在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了Diffusion Transformers的采样速度，实现了近乎3倍的加速效果。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在自然图像任务上表现出色，但其从技术图表中提取数学模型的能力尚未被探索。工程设计需要通过视觉理解和数学推理的层次化抽象，因此需要评估模型在这方面的表现。

Method: 通过一个包含8,006+问题的综合基准测试CircuitSense，评估了六种最先进的多模态大语言模型在电路理解上的表现，包括感知、分析和设计三个层次。

Result: 闭源模型在感知任务（如组件识别和拓扑识别）上准确率超过85%，但在符号推导和分析推理任务上表现低于19%。具备更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上表现更优。

Conclusion: CircuitSense benchmark揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在视觉到数学推理方面的根本局限性，特别是在符号推导和分析推理方面表现不佳。数学理解在电路合成中扮演基础性角色，符号推理能力是工程能力的关键指标。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Conclusion: 通过利用预训练的GPT-4模型的能力，结合特定设计的提示和输入图像，可以准确预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系，且无需标注训练数据，易于集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary

salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective

*Wenqiang Wang,Siyuan Liang,Xiao Yan,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDOA通过聚类和远标签策略，有效攻击动态输出场景，攻击成功率高且适用于生成式任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本对抗攻击方法在动态输出场景中的局限性。

Method: 采用聚类替代模型训练和最远标签目标攻击策略，将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景。

Result: 在四个数据集和八个受害者模型上验证了TDOA的有效性，攻击成功率最高达50.81%，静态场景下达82.68%。生成式任务中性能提升显著。

Conclusion: TDOA方法在动态输出场景和静态输出场景中均表现出色，不仅攻击成功率显著，还能扩展到生成式任务中。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

TL;DR: 通过逻辑张量网络（LTNs）融入医学知识，提升语义分割性能，尤其在数据稀缺时效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的语义分割系统在噪声和伪影存在时仍有改进空间，通过融入医学知识可以提升性能。

Method: 引入逻辑张量网络（LTNs）将医学背景知识编码为一阶逻辑规则，并与SwinUNETR结合进行端到端的语义分割。

Result: 实验表明，LTNs能提升基线分割性能，尤其在训练数据稀缺时效果显著。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法（如LTNs）具有通用性，可适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除技术主要针对扩散模型，无法适用于VAR模型，因此需要开发新的方法来应对VAR模型的安全问题。

Method: 提出VARE框架，利用辅助视觉标记减少微调强度；引入S-VARE方法，结合过滤交叉熵损失和保留损失，精确调整不安全视觉标记并保持语义保真度。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能够实现精确的概念擦除，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: VARE和S-VARE框架成功实现了VAR模型中的精确概念擦除，同时保持了生成质量，填补了自回归文本到图像生成中的安全漏洞。

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现深度伪造检测器在频率域存在光谱偏差，导致其过度依赖特定频段，限制了在未见伪造类型上的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了FreqDebias框架，包括Fo-Mixup增强和双重一致性正则化（CR），前者动态多样化训练样本的频率特征，后者通过局部（CAMs）和全局（vMF分布）监督促进一致性表示学习。

Result: FreqDebias显著提升了跨域泛化能力，并在跨域和域内设置中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreqDebias框架通过频率去偏策略显著提升了深度伪造检测器的跨域泛化能力，并在跨域和域内设置中优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

*Song Fei,Tian Ye,Lujia Wang,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucidFlux是一种无需标题的通用图像修复框架，通过轻量级双分支条件器和自适应调制计划，显著提升了图像修复的质量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用图像修复（UIR）旨在恢复由未知混合退化影响的图像，同时保留语义。然而，现有方法（如判别性修复器和基于UNet的扩散先验）常导致过度平滑、幻觉或漂移。

Method: LucidFlux引入了一个轻量级双分支条件器，用于注入退化输入和轻度修复代理的信号，分别锚定几何形状和抑制伪影。此外，设计了一个时间步和层次自适应的调制计划，以在骨干层次结构中路由这些线索，实现从粗到细的上下文感知更新。

Result: 在合成和真实场景基准测试中，LucidFlux始终优于强大的开源和商业基线，消融研究验证了各组件的必要性。

Conclusion: LucidFlux证明，在大型DiTs中，何时、何地以及如何进行条件注入——而非增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现稳健且无需标题的通用图像修复的关键。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net在医学图像分割中存在语义鸿沟和多尺度特征提取不足的局限性，导致细粒度细节和精确边界难以保留。

Method: 提出U-MAN架构，包含两个核心模块：PAGF（渐进注意力引导特征融合）替代传统跳跃连接，通过注意力机制融合编码器和解码器特征；MAN（多尺度自适应KAN）实现多尺度特征自适应处理。

Result: 在BUSI、GLAS和CVC三个公开数据集上的实验表明，U-MAN在边界定义和细节保留方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: U-MAN架构通过引入PAGF和MAN模块，有效解决了传统U-Net在医学图像分割中的语义鸿沟和多尺度特征提取不足的问题，显著提升了分割精度，特别是在边界准确性和细节保留方面。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Motivation: 现有模式识别模型通常基于预处理数据（如RGB图像或高比特ADC数据），但这类预处理可能不适用于自动化分析，且在低带宽和能耗受限场景下效率低下。

Method: 提出$\gamma$-Quant方法，即任务特定的非线性量化学习，应用于原始图像目标检测和可穿戴设备的人类活动识别（HAR）。

Result: 实验表明，使用4位可学习量化的原始数据在性能上与12位原始数据相当。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为$\gamma$-Quant的任务特定非线性量化学习方法，证明了在低比特深度捕获下，原始数据配合可学习的量化（如4位）可以达到与12位原始数据相当的性能。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

Motivation: 为了解决应用导向型VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据的高成本问题，提出自监督训练框架SSVIF。

Method: 利用特征级和像素级融合分割的一致性，设计了自监督任务（跨分割一致性）以及两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，SSVIF在无标签可见-红外图像对上训练时，性能优于传统VIF方法，并与有监督方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的SSVIF框架在无需下游任务标注数据的情况下，通过自监督学习实现了与有监督方法相媲美的性能，显著降低了数据获取成本。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 由于不同医学成像模态之间存在较大的域差距，训练鲁棒的学习算法具有挑战性。现有方法（如基于GAN的风格迁移）在高度可变区域难以捕捉跨域映射。

Method: 论文首先采用Bézier曲线进行风格迁移，减少源域和目标域之间的差距，随后利用分割模型生成伪标签，训练条件扩散模型（CDM）合成高质量的目标域图像，并通过不确定性引导的分数匹配方法提升CDM的鲁棒性。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成逼真的标注图像，显著增强目标域并提升分割性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合Bézier曲线和扩散模型的统一框架，用于跨域图像生成，显著提升了分割模型的性能。

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

TL;DR: PSTTS是一种无需额外参数的渐进式时空标记选择模块，通过空间纯化和时间选择有效减少事件数据中的冗余，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理事件数据时忽略了高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致计算开销大，且现有RGB视频的标记稀疏化方法不适用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：空间标记纯化和时间标记选择，分别处理事件数据中的噪声和非事件区域以及冗余时间信息。

Result: 在DailyDVS-200数据集上，PSTTS减少了29-43.6%的FLOPs，提高了21.6-41.3%的FPS，同时保持了任务准确性。

Conclusion: PSTTS模块通过有效地识别和丢弃时空冗余标记，在保持任务准确性的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

Motivation: 现有方法对所有图像令牌进行均匀优化，忽略了不同令牌对RLVR训练的贡献差异，阻碍了性能提升。

Method: 提出GCPO方法，从因果依赖、熵诱导的空间结构和RLVR聚焦的令牌多样性三个角度识别关键令牌，并引入动态令牌优势权重进行优化。

Result: GCPO仅利用30%的图像令牌即可实现比GRPO更优的性能，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GCPO通过识别和优化关键图像令牌，显著提升了基于RLVR的自回归视觉生成性能，实验证明其在多个文本到图像基准测试中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

Conclusion: EAGLE 框架在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的可解释性方面表现出色，尤其在忠实性、定位和幻觉诊断方面优于现有方法，同时显著减少 GPU 内存需求。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

Result: VLMs在典型颜色上准确率高，但在非典型颜色集上表现显著下降。跨语言分析显示训练数据严重偏向英语和中文。

Conclusion: 研究发现，虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）在典型颜色命名上表现良好，但在非典型颜色集上表现显著下降。语言模型架构对颜色命名有独立于视觉处理能力的影响。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyCoVAD是一种混合SSL-LLM模型，结合了SSL的低级时空模式建模和LLM的语义推理能力，显著提升了复杂视频异常检测性能并优化了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSL方法难以捕捉复杂异常的语义关系，而LLM虽具备强大推理能力但计算成本高且缺乏细粒度空间定位。

Method: HyCoVAD采用多任务SSL时间分析器和LLM验证器的混合模型，其中SSL模块基于nnFormer架构，LLM模块提供语义上下文验证。

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上，HyCoVAD的帧级AUC达到72.5%，超出基线12.5%，同时降低了LLM计算量。

Conclusion: HyCoVAD通过结合SSL和LLM的优势，在复杂视频异常检测中取得了显著性能提升，并减少了计算开销。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

Motivation: SNN的半监督学习方法相较于ANN仍未被充分探索，但其生物合理性和能效性使其具有重要研究价值。

Method: 提出了SpikeMatch框架，利用SNN的泄漏因子进行多样化伪标签生成，并通过弱增强样本生成可靠伪标签来训练强增强样本。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch作为首个SNN半监督学习框架，通过利用SNN的时间动态特性，有效提升了半监督学习性能，并在多个标准基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: LongLive是一种实时交互式长视频生成框架，通过因果自回归设计和多项创新技术，解决了效率和质量问题，支持高性能推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成在效率和质量上面临挑战，现有方法如扩散模型和因果注意力自回归模型在效率和长视频质量上存在不足，且交互式需求增加了复杂性。

Method: 采用因果、帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制以实现平滑切换，使用流式长调优对齐训练和推理，并引入短窗口注意力和帧级注意力汇以保持长范围一致性。

Result: LongLive在单个NVIDIA H100上实现了20.7 FPS的高效推理，支持240秒长视频生成，并支持INT8量化推理，质量损失极小。

Conclusion: LongLive通过其因果、帧级自回归设计、KV重缓存机制、流式长调优和短窗口注意力等技术，有效解决了长视频生成中的效率和质量问题，支持实时交互和高性能推理。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

TL;DR: SPARK框架通过回收数据训练生成奖励模型，显著提升了模型性能，无需额外奖励模型或人类偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF高成本和潜在奖励-策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信号的问题。

Method: SPARK是一种基于RLVR的高效、稳定、策略内方法，通过回收滚动和正确性数据，同时训练模型作为生成奖励模型。

Result: SPARK在多个LLM和LVLM模型上实现了显著性能提升，例如SPARK-VL-7B在推理、奖励和通用基准上分别平均提升了9.7%、12.1%和1.5%。

Conclusion: SPARK框架通过协同策略和奖励模型的共同进化，显著提升了LLMs和LVLMs的性能，展示了其鲁棒性和广泛泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

TL;DR: CCNeXt是一种自监督卷积架构，用于深度估计，结合CNN和窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，在速度和准确性上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在不同场景中获取可靠地面真实深度数据的困难，自监督技术在大型未标记数据集可用时成为一种解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的自监督卷积方法CCNeXt，结合现代CNN特征提取器和窗口化极线交叉注意力模块的编码器，以及深度估计解码器的全面重新设计。

Result: CCNeXt在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上表现优异，速度快且在所有指标上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CCNeXt架构在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上实现了竞争性指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，并在KITTI Eigen Split改进地面真实数据和Driving Stereo数据集中所有指标上达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

TL;DR: UML-CoT框架利用UML生成结构化CoT和可执行计划，显著提升LLMs在具体任务中的推理能力，效果优于非结构化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结构化CoT方法（如场景图或逻辑图）存在局限性，无法建模高阶关系、缺乏继承或行为抽象等构造，且未提供顺序或条件规划的标准语义。

Method: 提出了UML-CoT框架，结合UML类图捕捉对象语义和活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练流程，包括监督微调和基于组相对策略优化（GRPO）的奖励学习。

Result: 在MRoom-30k（一个新的杂乱房间清理场景基准）上，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面均优于非结构化CoT方法。

Conclusion: UML-CoT框架通过利用统一建模语言（UML）生成符号化的链式思维（CoT）和可执行的动作计划，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLMs）在具体任务中的推理能力。相比非结构化的CoT方法，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面表现更优。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量、领域特定的数据集是构建稳健视觉系统的关键，但现有方法在数据质量、多样性和成本之间存在复杂权衡。Labeling Copilot旨在通过自动化工具解决这一瓶颈。

Method: Labeling Copilot采用大型多模态语言模型驱动的中央协调器，通过多步推理执行三个核心功能：校准发现、可控合成和共识标注。共识标注模块结合非极大值抑制和投票机制，协调多个基础模型生成准确标签。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，共识标注模块平均每图像生成14.2个候选提案（是真实标注的2倍），标注mAP达37.1%。在Open Images数据集中，发现903个新边界框类别，总类别超1500个。校准发现工具在1000万样本规模下，计算效率比同类方法高40倍。

Conclusion: Labeling Copilot通过其核心组件（校准发现、可控合成和共识标注）为工业级数据集的高质量标注提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，验证了代理工作流在大规模数据标注中的有效性。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小样本图像分类因标记数据有限而具有挑战性，现有方法通常需要大量模型微调或外部信息源。

Method: DIPSY利用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，提出了三个关键创新：扩展的无分类器引导方案、基于类别相似性的采样策略以及无需模型微调的流程。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，DIPSY达到了最先进或可比的性能，且无需生成模型适配或依赖外部工具。

Conclusion: DIPSY通过提出一种无需训练的生成方法，显著提升了小样本图像分类的性能，特别是在细粒度分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Method: 本研究通过引入马尔可夫注意力掩码，从理论上证明了VAR与离散扩散模型的等价性，并提出了SRDD方法，将扩散模型的优势（如迭代优化）直接应用于VAR。

Result: 实验结果表明，SRDD在多个数据集上均实现了更快的收敛、更低的推理成本和更好的零样本重建效果，证明了扩散模型视角对VAR的积极影响。

Conclusion: 通过重新解读VAR与离散扩散模型的数学等价性，本研究建立了自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁，证明了SRDD在效率、生成质量和零样本重建方面的优势。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Motivation: 现有参考分割方法通常需要微调或多模型组合，成本较高。扩散模型蕴含丰富语义信息，可作为通用特征提取器，因此探索其直接应用于下游任务的可能性。

Conclusion: RefAM框架通过利用扩散变换器的特征和注意力机制，无需微调或额外训练，在零样本参考图像和视频分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

TL;DR: The paper presents a GPU-resident redesign of GROMACS' halo-exchange algorithm using NVSHMEM, improving strong scaling by up to 2x through better communication-computation overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of MPI's CPU-centric nature, which introduces latencies on GPU-resident applications, hindering GPU utilization and scalability in molecular dynamics simulations.

Method: An NVSHMEM-based GPU kernel-initiated redesign of the GROMACS domain decomposition halo-exchange algorithm, utilizing highly tuned GPU kernels, kernel fusion, and the asynchronous copy engine over NVLink.

Result: Improved GROMACS strong scaling performance by up to 1.5x (intra-node) and 2x (multi-node), and up to 1.3x multi-node over NVLink+InfiniBand.

Conclusion: The GPU-resident formulation with NVSHMEM-based redesign significantly improves GROMACS' strong scaling performance, demonstrating the benefits of GPU-initiated communication for latency-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Improving time-to-solution in molecular dynamics simulations often requires
strong scaling due to fixed-sized problems. GROMACS is highly
latency-sensitive, with peak iteration rates in the sub-millisecond, making
scalability on heterogeneous supercomputers challenging. MPI's CPU-centric
nature introduces additional latencies on GPU-resident applications' critical
path, hindering GPU utilization and scalability. To address these limitations,
we present an NVSHMEM-based GPU kernel-initiated redesign of the GROMACS domain
decomposition halo-exchange algorithm. Highly tuned GPU kernels fuse data
packing and communication, leveraging hardware latency-hiding for fine-grained
overlap. We employ kernel fusion across overlapped data forwarding
communication phases and utilize the asynchronous copy engine over NVLink to
optimize latency and bandwidth. Our GPU-resident formulation greatly increases
communication-computation overlap, improving GROMACS strong scaling performance
across NVLink by up to 1.5x (intra-node) and 2x (multi-node), and up to 1.3x
multi-node over NVLink+InfiniBand. This demonstrates the profound benefits of
GPU-initiated communication for strong-scaling a broad range of
latency-sensitive applications.

data-parallel training. Recent frameworks attempt to mitigate these issues
through data reorganization or hybrid parallel strategies. However, they often
overlook how computational and communication costs scale with sequence length,
resulting in suboptimal performance. We identify three critical challenges: (1)
varying computation-to-communication ratios across sequences of different
lengths in distributed attention, (2) mismatch between static NIC-GPU affinity
and dynamic parallel workloads, and (3) distinct optimal partitioning
strategies required for quadratic attention versus linear components. To
address these challenges, we present Zeppelin, a novel training system that
integrates three key techniques: (1) a hierarchical sequence partitioning
method for the attention module that reduces communication overhead and
balances computation, supported by an efficient attention engine that applies
divergent parallel strategies; (2) a routing layer that orchestrates inter-node
transfers to fully utilize NIC bandwidth; and (3) a remapping layer that
transforms sequence layouts between attention and linear modules, ensuring high
computational efficiency across both. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse
configurations show that Zeppelin delivers an average 2.80x speedup over
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 研究探讨利用LLMs自动翻译服务器无功能以减少能源债务，初步结果显示节能潜力，但面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算基础设施的快速数字化和新兴技术（如AI模型）的使用增加了排放，现有缓解策略依赖利益相关者干预，难以在遗留系统中应用。

Method: 设计并实现了ReFaaS，集成到Fission服务器无框架中，评估多种LLMs的代码翻译能力及其对能源消耗的影响。

Result: 初步结果表明，翻译后的功能可减少高达70%的调用能源，约3000至5000次调用后实现净节能，但并非所有功能都适合翻译。

Conclusion: 尽管存在局限性，ReFaaS展示了通过LLMs自动翻译服务器无功能以减少能源债务的潜力，并提出了四个关键研究挑战以推动长期自动化缓解。

Abstract: The rapid digitization and the increasing use of emerging technologies such
as AI models have significantly contributed to the emissions of computing
infrastructure. Efforts to mitigate this impact typically focus on the
infrastructure level such as powering data centers with renewable energy, or
through the specific design of energy-efficient software. However, both
strategies rely on stakeholder intervention, making their adoption in legacy
and already-deployed systems unlikely. As a result, past architectural and
implementation decisions continue to incur additional energy usage - a
phenomenon we refer to as energy debt.
  Hence, in this paper, we investigate the potential of serverless computing
platforms to automatically reduce energy debt by leveraging the unique access
to function source code. Specifically, we explore whether large language models
(LLMs) can translate serverless functions into more energy-efficient
programming languages while preserving functional correctness. To this end, we
design and implement ReFaaS and integrate it into the Fission serverless
framework. We evaluate multiple LLMs on their ability to perform such code
translations and analyze their impact on energy consumption.
  Our preliminary results indicate that translated functions can reduce
invocation energy by up to 70%, achieving net energy savings after
approximately 3,000 to 5,000 invocations, depending on the LLM used.
Nonetheless, the approach faces several challenges: not all functions are
suitable for translation, and for some, the amortization threshold is
significantly higher or unreachable. Despite these limitations, we identify
four key research challenges whose resolution could unlock long-term, automated
mitigation of energy debt in serverless computing.

Conclusion: AI_INFN项目通过Kubernetes平台和云原生解决方案，有效支持了INFN用例中机器学习技术的采用，特别是在GPU加速的数据分析工作流开发及其在异构分布式计算资源上的扩展性方面。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is driving a revolution in the way scientists design,
develop, and deploy data-intensive software. However, the adoption of ML
presents new challenges for the computing infrastructure, particularly in terms
of provisioning and orchestrating access to hardware accelerators for
development, testing, and production. The INFN-funded project AI_INFN
(Artificial Intelligence at INFN) aims at fostering the adoption of ML
techniques within INFN use cases by providing support on multiple aspects,
including the provisioning of AI-tailored computing resources. It leverages
cloud-native solutions in the context of INFN Cloud, to share hardware
accelerators as effectively as possible, ensuring the diversity of the
Institute's research activities is not compromised. In this contribution, we
provide an update on the commissioning of a Kubernetes platform designed to
ease the development of GPU-powered data analysis workflows and their
scalability on heterogeneous distributed computing resources, also using the
offloading mechanism with Virtual Kubelet and InterLink API. This setup can
manage workflows across different resource providers, including sites of the
Worldwide LHC Computing Grid and supercomputers such as CINECA Leonardo,
providing a model for use cases requiring dedicated infrastructures for
different parts of the workload. Initial test results, emerging case studies,
and integration scenarios will be presented with functional tests and

Motivation: 为了进一步理解online-LOCAL和SLOCAL模型中全局内存的优势边界，尤其是在网格图中3-coloring问题的局部性需求。

Method: 本文提出了一种方法，通过构建特定场景，展示了即使在算法拥有网格方向信息的情况下，3-coloring问题仍需要高局部性。

Result: 证明了在确定性或随机性online-LOCAL模型中，即使算法拥有网格方向信息，3-coloring网格图仍需要Ω(logn)局部性。

Conclusion: 本文通过移除对网格方向假设的依赖，证明了即使在算法明确获得全局一致的网格方向时，确定性或随机性online-LOCAL模型中3-coloring网格图仍需要Ω(logn)局部性。

Abstract: The online-LOCAL and SLOCAL models are extensions of the LOCAL model where
nodes are processed in a sequential but potentially adversarial order. So far,
the only problem we know of where the global memory of the online-LOCAL model
has an advantage over SLOCAL is 3-coloring bipartite graphs. Recently, Chang et
al. [PODC 2024] showed that even in grids, 3-coloring requires $\Omega(\log n)$
locality in deterministic online-LOCAL. This result was subsequently extended
by Akbari et al. [STOC 2025] to also hold in randomized online-LOCAL. However,
both proofs heavily rely on the assumption that the algorithm does not have
access to the orientation of the underlying grid. In this paper, we show how to
lift this requirement and obtain the same lower bound (against either model)
even when the algorithm is explicitly given a globally consistent orientation
of the grid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白盒监控器在检测有害行为时存在数据泄露问题，导致其效果被夸大。需要一种方法来评估监控器是否真正检测到模型行为而非表面诱骗痕迹。

Method: 提出了一个系统性框架，包括内容过滤、分数过滤和微调模型生物三种策略，用于评估监控器的性能。

Result: 实验发现，内容过滤能平滑去除诱骗信号，降低AUROC 30%；分数过滤降低AUROC 15%；微调模型生物虽改进评估但性能下降40%。

Conclusion: 白盒监控器在检测大型语言模型潜在有害行为方面具有优势，但存在数据泄露问题。通过内容过滤、分数过滤和微调模型生物三种策略，可以有效评估监控器的性能，尽管这些策略会降低其性能。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过自我训练和决策支点验证，有效提升了大型语言模型的推理能力，无需依赖真实推理数据或外部指标。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

TL;DR: 研究比较了经典机器学习模型和图神经网络在预测消费者行为方面的表现，发现图神经网络在某些方面优于经典模型，为理解消费者行为提供了新视角。


<details>

Motivation: 预测消费者行为在市场营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中具有重要意义。脑电图数据能够通过提供大脑神经活动的详细信息帮助分析决策过程。

Method: 首先从NeuMa数据集中提取并清理脑电图数据特征，为图神经网络模型创建脑连接特征。随后应用并比较了不同的机器学习模型，包括经典模型和图神经网络。

Result: 尽管结果总体上没有显示出显著差异，但图神经网络在某些基本标准上表现更好，而经典模型在这些方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 结合脑电图信号分析和机器学习模型可以更深入地理解消费者行为，同时提供了广泛使用的模型与较少使用的模型（如图神经网络）之间的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的算法发现框架缺乏领域知识和多步推理能力，难以应对复杂的地理空间问题。GeoEvolve 旨在填补这一空白。

Method: GeoEvolve 采用双层循环结构：内层循环通过代码进化器生成和变异候选解决方案，外层代理控制器评估全局精英并查询 GeoKnowRAG 模块，注入地理学理论先验。

Result: GeoEvolve 在空间插值（克里金法）和空间不确定性量化任务中表现优异，将插值误差降低 13-21%，不确定性估计性能提升 17%。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve 通过结合地理空间领域知识和进化搜索，为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展的路径，展示了在科学发现中的高效性和可信度。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

Motivation: 传统F1指标在处理语义相关但非完全匹配的预测时过于严格，无法反映现实中人类标注的模糊性和类别重叠性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的两步精确率-召回率计算公式，结合标签相似性矩阵计算软精确率和软召回率，从而得到Semantic F1分数。

Result: 通过理论和实证验证，Semantic F1在解释性和生态有效性上优于现有指标，且对相似性矩阵的误指定具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Semantic F1分数通过引入语义相似性矩阵，为模糊或多标签分类任务提供了更公平和生态有效的评估方法，适用于多种任务和模态。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

Motivation: 低资源语言中配对文本和语音数据稀缺，而ASR模型更易获取，因此需要一种适应新语言的TTS系统开发方法。

Method: 提出了基于GRPO的框架，首先通过IPA令牌训练多语言基线，然后在有限配对数据上微调，最后应用GRPO优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，该管道在低资源语言中产生了可懂且说话人一致的语音，显著优于仅微调的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在低资源语言中显著优于仅微调的方法，同时在高资源语言中也超越了离线对齐方法（如DPO），在可懂度、说话人相似性和音频质量方面表现更优。

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Method: 提出Retrieval-of-Thought（RoT）方法，通过组织和检索先前的推理步骤构建动态模板，指导新问题的生成。

Conclusion: RoT通过动态模板检索和重用，显著提高了大型推理模型的效率，减少了输出令牌、推理延迟和成本，同时保持了准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Method: 设计了UltraHorizon基准，通过探索任务在三个不同环境中验证智能体的核心能力，包括持续的推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用。

Conclusion: 论文通过引入UltraHorizon基准，揭示了当前LLM智能体在长视野任务中的表现不足，并指出简单的规模扩展无法解决这一问题。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

TL;DR: WebRSSBench是一个新的综合Web理解基准，评估了12个MLLMs在推理、鲁棒性和安全方面的能力，结果显示模型在这些方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对端到端Web应用所需的推理、鲁棒性和安全能力的评估，因此需要一个新的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 通过构建WebRSSBench，一个包含8项任务（如位置关系推理、颜色鲁棒性和安全关键检测等）的综合Web理解基准，从729个网站中收集了3799个问答对，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和结合自动检查与人工验证的多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估了12个MLLMs，结果显示模型在组合和跨元素推理、面对用户界面和内容扰动时的鲁棒性，以及识别和避免安全关键或不可逆操作方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 现有MLLMs在WebRSSBench上的表现显示，模型在组合和跨元素推理、面对用户界面和内容扰动时的鲁棒性，以及识别和避免安全关键或不可逆操作方面仍有显著不足。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

TL;DR: D-Artemis是一种新型GUI代理框架，通过模拟人类认知循环解决了现有方法的局限性，并在多个基准测试中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理面临数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测成本高和矛盾指导风险等挑战，D-Artemis旨在通过模拟人类认知循环（思考、对齐和反思）来解决这些问题。

Method: D-Artemis框架包括三个关键组件：细粒度的应用特定提示检索机制、预执行对齐阶段（包含思想-行动一致性检查模块和行动修正代理）以及状态反思代理。

Result: D-Artemis在AndroidWorld上实现了75.8%的成功率，在ScreenSpot-V2上实现了96.8%的成功率，展现了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: D-Artemis通过引入细粒度的应用特定提示检索机制、预执行对齐阶段和状态反思代理，显著提升了GUI任务的性能，并在多个基准测试中取得了新的SOTA结果。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

Motivation: 现有基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI代理，且静态轨迹评估方法准确性有限。

Method: ProRe 采用主动奖励系统，由通用推理器调度状态探测任务，评估器代理执行环境交互以收集额外观察。

Result: 在3K轨迹上的实验显示，ProRe将奖励准确性和F1分数分别提升5.3%和19.4%，与先进策略代理结合时任务成功率提升22.4%。

Conclusion: ProRe 通过结合通用推理器和领域特定评估器，显著提升了GUI代理的奖励准确性和任务成功率。

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

TL;DR: DS-STAR是一种新型数据科学代理，通过自动数据文件分析、LLM验证和顺序规划，解决了异构数据格式和分析计划验证的挑战，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学任务通常复杂且涉及多样化数据源，而现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在异构数据格式处理和生成分析计划方面表现不佳，缺乏验证计划充分性的方法。

Method: DS-STAR引入了三个关键贡献：(1) 数据文件分析模块，自动探索和提取多样化数据格式的上下文；(2) 验证步骤，由LLM基础的法官评估分析计划的充分性；(3) 顺序规划机制，从简单可执行的计划开始，基于反馈迭代优化直至计划充分性得到验证。

Result: DS-STAR在多样化数据源和异构格式的任务中表现出色，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DS-STAR在三个具有挑战性的基准测试（DABStep、KramaBench和DA-Code）中实现了最先进的性能，尤其在需要处理多种异构数据格式的困难任务上显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

Method: 通过引入一个基于公理的决策建模框架，定义了一个基于结构属性的公理分类法，并展示了决策公理与评估公理之间的紧张关系。

Result: 研究发现，决策-评估悖论在现实公理结构中普遍存在，强调了在决策数据训练模型或应用公理时需要特别小心。

Conclusion: 论文强调了在使用公理进行决策和评估时需要格外谨慎，以避免决策-评估悖论，并指出了在训练模型或应用公理时需特别注意的现实意义。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Conclusion: DeepTravel 通过端到端的强化学习框架，显著提升了小型大语言模型（如 Qwen3 32B）在旅行规划任务中的表现，超越了现有前沿模型如 OpenAI o1、o3 和 DeepSeek R1。

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

Conclusion: TRACE通过架构对齐的骨干网络和解耦的学习目标，为图上的计算学习提供了一个更稳健的范式，显著优于所有现有架构。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: RISK是一个用于电子商务风险管理的GUI代理框架，通过整合数据集、基准测试和强化微调框架，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据抓取方法和大多数现有GUI代理无法处理电子商务风险管理中需要聚合多样化、深度嵌入的网页数据并通过多步、有状态的交互来完成的复杂任务。

Method: RISK框架包括三个部分：RISK-Data（数据集）、RISK-Bench（基准测试）和RISK-R1（强化微调框架）。RISK-R1通过四个方面的改进来优化性能：输出格式、单步级别、多步级别和任务级别。

Result: 实验表明，RISK-R1在离线单步任务中提升了6.8%，离线多步任务中提升了8.8%，并在在线评估中达到了70.5%的最高任务成功率。

Conclusion: RISK框架通过整合RISK-Data、RISK-Bench和RISK-R1三个组件，提供了一个可扩展的领域特定解决方案，用于自动化复杂的网络交互，提升了电子商务风险管理的技术水平。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

*Dong-Kyum Kim,Minsung Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过训练语言模型在关系知识图谱上，可以诱导出双线性内部表示结构，从而解决反向推理问题并保持编辑后的逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在反向推理（如从'A是B'推断'B是A'）中的局限性是否是其固有缺陷，还是知识编码方式的产物。

Method: 通过从头开始训练语言模型在一个合成的关系知识图谱数据集上，展示了双线性关系结构在其隐藏表示中的出现。

Result: 研究发现，双线性关系结构显著减轻了反向诅咒，使得模型能够推断未见过的反向事实。此外，这种结构在模型编辑中起到了关键作用，确保编辑正确地传播到反向和其他逻辑依赖的事实上。

Conclusion: 训练语言模型时，如果采用关系知识图谱数据，可以诱导出双线性内部表示结构，从而使得模型在编辑后能保持逻辑一致性。这表明模型编辑的成功不仅依赖于编辑算法，还依赖于被修改知识的底层表示几何结构。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出GSM-Agent基准测试，专注于评估LLM的代理推理能力，发现前沿模型表现不佳，并提出工具增强方法以改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试常将代理推理与复杂数学推理、专家级知识等高级能力混合，难以纯粹评估代理推理能力。因此，需要一种更纯净的评估方法。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准测试，要求LLM代理解决小学水平的数学问题，但仅提供问题而不提供前提信息，需主动使用工具收集信息。提出代理推理图概念，通过聚类环境文档嵌入并映射工具调用来构建推理路径。

Result: 即使是前沿模型如GPT-5，在GSM-Agent基准测试中准确率仅为67%。研究发现，许多模型在代理推理中缺乏重新访问先前节点的能力，而这是静态推理中的关键模式。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个名为GSM-Agent的新基准测试，旨在更纯净地评估LLM的代理推理能力，并通过引入代理推理图概念和工具增强测试时间扩展方法，为未来研究提供了框架和方向。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）在现实应用中的需求增长，如何高效生成具有可调推理能力的模型谱系成为关键挑战。模型合并作为一种无需训练的解决方案，具有潜力但尚未被充分探索。

Method: 本研究通过大规模实证评估，系统性地比较了多种模型合并技术在不同推理基准上的表现，并通过调整合并强度构建了准确性与效率的权衡曲线。

Result: 研究发现，模型合并能够实现对推理能力的细粒度控制，甚至在父模型权重空间高度不同的情况下，仍能实现Pareto改进（即合并模型在准确性和效率上均优于其中一个父模型）。

Conclusion: 模型合并是一种有效且可控的方法，能够校准推理准确性和计算效率之间的权衡，为满足多样化应用需求提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对模型在单次尝试中的表现与其潜在能力之间的差距，设计了一种显式提升模型性能的框架。

Method: 提出了A2R（非对称两阶段推理）框架，包括并行生成潜在解决方案的“探索者”模型和整合这些方案进行精细化推理的“合成者”模型。

Result: 使用A2R框架后，Qwen3-8B-distill模型的性能提升了75%，且A2R-Efficient变体在成本降低30%的情况下超越了单体Qwen3-32B模型的平均性能。

Conclusion: A2R框架不仅显著提升了模型在复杂任务上的表现，还通过非对称扩展范式实现了成本效益的优化，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 现实世界中的机器人系统需要同时平衡多个相互冲突的目标，而现有复杂交互导致无法直接使用现成的先进MOS算法。

Method: 采用聚合函数优化隐藏目标的方法，扩展标准MOS算法的核心操作以反映特定的聚合函数。

Result: 在多种机器人规划问题中，扩展后的MOS算法性能显著优于未使用目标聚合的原始算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通用的多目标搜索问题表述，通过隐藏目标的聚合函数优化解决方案目标，支持标准MOS算法的应用，并在多个机器人规划问题中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

Motivation: 尽管ML和AI的创新潜力巨大，但其快速发展对环境的影响日益显著。现有的量化工具虽然易于使用，但估算准确性存疑。

Method: 通过比较数百个AI实验的真实测量数据，提出了一个验证框架，评估静态和动态能源估算方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过系统性评估静态和动态能源估算方法的可靠性，提供了AI能源需求和估算误差的深入见解，并为可持续AI发展建立了透明度和验证标准。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

TL;DR: Log2Plan通过两层次规划和用户日志挖掘，提升了GUI自动化的鲁棒性和效率，尤其在复杂任务中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划-执行代理在泛化性、延迟和长序列一致性方面存在局限，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: Log2Plan采用结构化两层次规划框架，结合用户行为日志的任务挖掘方法，将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典，并通过实时GUI上下文解释将高级计划转化为低级动作序列。

Result: 在200个真实任务中，Log2Plan显著提高了任务成功率和执行时间，尤其在长序列任务中保持超过60.0%的成功率。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结合两层次规划框架和用户行为日志的任务挖掘方法，显著提升了GUI任务自动化的鲁棒性和适应性，尤其在长序列任务中表现优异。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集标注通常存在不确定性，标注者意见不一且置信度不均，传统聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性。

Method: 提出使用概率度量直接操作分布来明确考虑标注不确定性，这些度量可以独立于标注生成过程应用，无论是通过简单计数、主观置信度评分还是概率响应模型。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二进制标签的置信度显著影响了模型排名。

Conclusion: 作者呼吁社区发布原始标注数据并采用不确定性感知评估，以更好地反映临床数据的性能估计。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Conclusion: InfiMed-Foundation系列模型通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗领域提供了更可靠、高效的AI驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代状态空间模型（SSMs）的转移矩阵在计算效率上表现良好，但在表达能力（如模拟有限状态自动机）方面存在限制。非结构化转移矩阵虽表达能力强，但计算和内存成本过高。

Method: PD-SSM 将转移矩阵参数化为列单热矩阵（P）和复值对角矩阵（D）的乘积，从而在保持计算效率的同时实现最优状态大小和深度。

Result: PD-SSM 在 FSA 状态跟踪任务中显著优于现有结构化 SSM 变体，在多类时间序列分类任务中表现与神经控制微分方程相当，并能有效跟踪复杂 FSA 的状态。

Conclusion: PD-SSM 通过结构化稀疏参数化方法显著提升了状态空间模型的表达能力，同时保持了计算效率，适用于复杂任务如时间序列分类和 Transformer-SSM 混合架构。

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

TL;DR: PRIME是一个多智能体推理框架，整合了快速直觉和慢速深思熟虑的认知过程，显著提升了开源大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受《思考，快与慢》中人类认知的双过程理论启发，PRIME旨在通过模拟人类认知过程，提升大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的效率和准确性。

Method: PRIME采用多智能体推理框架，首先由快速思考代理（System 1）生成快速答案，若检测到不确定性，则触发由规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策制定等专门代理组成的System 2推理流程。

Result: 实验结果表明，PRIME使开源大语言模型（如LLaMA 3）在多跳和知识基础推理基准测试中表现优异，与顶级闭源模型（如GPT-4和GPT-4o）竞争。

Conclusion: PRIME框架通过动态整合快速直觉思维（System 1）和慢速深思熟虑思维（System 2），显著提升了开源大语言模型（如LLaMA 3）在复杂知识密集型推理任务中的表现，使其能够与顶级闭源模型（如GPT-4和GPT-4o）竞争。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注最终答案准确性，忽视了 LLM 搜索代理在外部证据上的推理和行为。SeekBench 填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过专家标注的 190 条追踪数据和 1,800 多个响应步骤，对 LLM 搜索代理的证据使用、搜索适应性和校准能力进行细粒度分析。

Result: SeekBench 提供了对 LLM 搜索代理认知能力的详细评估，揭示了其在证据使用、搜索适应性和校准方面的表现。

SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps
generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for
granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

TL;DR: EMMA框架通过生成多样化的机器人操作视频和优化训练策略，显著提升了视觉-语言-动作模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实机器人操作数据收集成本高昂且耗时，需要一种方法来增强数据多样性和训练效率。

Method: 提出了EMMA框架，包括DreamTransfer（基于扩散Transformer的多视角一致视频生成方法）和AdaMix（硬样本感知训练策略）。

Result: 生成的视频在多视角一致性、几何保真度和文本条件准确性上优于现有方法，VLA模型在零样本任务中性能提升超过200%。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过结合生成数据引擎和有效训练管道，显著提升了VLA策略的泛化能力，特别是在零样本视觉域任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Motivation: 基础模型（FMs）为人工生命（ALife）模拟提供了强大的自动化搜索工具，但现有方法主要依赖于视觉语言模型（VLMs）与自然语言目标提示的对齐，缺乏开放式的探索能力。

Method: ASAL++ 在ASAL的基础上，利用第二个基础模型根据模拟的视觉历史提出新的进化目标，并探索了两种策略：Evolved Supervised Targets (EST) 和 Evolved Temporal Targets (ETT)。

Result: 在Lenia基质中使用Gemma-3提出进化目标的实验表明，EST策略促进了更大的视觉新颖性，而ETT策略则培养了更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++ 通过引入多模态基础模型（FMs）驱动的开放搜索方法，为人工生命（ALife）领域提供了新的研究方向，展示了基础模型在推动ALife发现中的潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

TL;DR: GeoSketch是一个神经符号框架，通过交互式循环解决几何问题，结合感知、推理和动态操作，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法将图表视为静态图像，缺乏动态操作能力，而动态操作是人类几何推理的核心。

Method: GeoSketch框架包含三个模块：感知模块将图表抽象为结构化逻辑形式；符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一步推理步骤；草图行动模块执行如绘制辅助线或应用变换等操作。采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，GeoSketch在逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率上显著优于静态感知方法。

Conclusion: GeoSketch通过将几何推理重新定义为交互式的感知-推理-行动循环，显著提高了逐步推理的准确性和问题解决的成功率，为复杂视觉空间问题的解决奠定了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

Motivation: 当前LLM智能体的开发需要大量手工设计和调整，限制了其扩展性和成本效益，因此需要一种更通用和高效的框架。

Method: 提出了InfiAgent，一个基于金字塔状DAG的多智能体框架，包括“智能体即工具”机制、双重审计机制、智能体路由功能和自进化机制。

Result: 评估显示InfiAgent在性能上比类似框架ADAS高出9.9%，案例研究中的InfiHelper生成的论文获得了顶级IEEE会议的认可。

Conclusion: InfiAgent框架通过其创新的多智能体架构和自进化机制，显著提升了LLM智能体的性能和适应性，能够广泛应用于无限场景，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

Motivation: 随着语言模型代理能力增强并广泛接触现实工具，需要一个可扩展的评估框架来衡量其代理能力。传统基于基准的评估方法设计成本高且需要人工设计任务。

Method: 提出了EELMA（Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents）算法，通过多轮文本交互近似计算有效赋权。

Result: 赋权与平均任务表现强相关，高赋权状态和动作通常是通用能力的关键时刻。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，赋权（empowerment）作为一种通用指标，在复杂、开放的环境中评估和监控语言模型代理具有吸引力。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

Conclusion: 该研究通过定义‘推理流形’概念，构建了REMA框架，成功将抽象的推理失败与可测量的几何偏差联系起来，为理解黑盒模型的内部计算过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作行为，忽略了大规模代理社会中利他主义的涌现机制。

Method: 通过引入一个Schelling变体的城市迁移模型，创造社会困境，并采用基于扎根理论的系统编码方法定性分析代理决策的认知基础。

Result: 研究发现LLMs存在两种截然不同的社会倾向原型：'适应性利己者'和'利他优化者'，前者在社交规范影响下利他行为显著增加，后者则始终优先集体利益。

Conclusion: 本研究首次揭示了不同大型语言模型（LLMs）在利己与利他倾向上的内在异质性，提出在社会模拟中，模型选择不仅是推理能力的问题，更是选择内在社会行为逻辑的问题。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和共进化循环，显著提升了大型语言模型在运筹学问题上的表现，并生成了一个通用的过程验证器。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

Conclusion: DES作为一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS方法，展示了现代LLMs结构灵活性如何推动推理能力的提升。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究揭示RL在LLM规划中的探索作用优于SFT，Q-learning在多样性和奖励设计上优于PG，实验验证了理论发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习（RL）在提升大型语言模型（LLM）规划能力中的理论依据，揭示其优势和局限性。

Method: 通过基于图的可处理抽象，分析策略梯度（PG）和Q-learning方法，结合监督微调（SFT）的比较。

Result: 发现SFT可能引入虚假解决方案，而RL通过探索实现正确规划；PG存在多样性崩溃问题，而Q-learning能保持多样性并避免奖励滥用。

Conclusion: 研究表明，Q-learning在保持输出多样性和避免奖励滥用方面优于策略梯度方法，为LLM规划任务提供了更可靠的理论基础。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

*Md Sajid Islam,Tanvir Hasan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种混合智能路由框架，结合机器学习增强AODV，显著提高了蓝牙Mesh网络的路由可靠性，特别是在无基础设施环境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的路由策略（如AODV）在拥塞和动态拓扑变化下性能下降，蓝牙Mesh网络在紧急和资源受限场景中具有潜力，但需要更可靠的路由方案。

Method: 提出了一个混合智能路由框架，该框架通过监督机器学习增强AODV，集成了四种预测模型（交付成功分类器、TTL回归器、延迟回归器和转发器适用性分类器），形成一个统一的评分机制，动态排名邻居节点。

Result: 在模拟环境中，混合ABCD模型实现了约99.97%的数据包交付率，显著优于基准和中间方法。

Conclusion: 轻量级、可解释的机器学习模型能够显著提升蓝牙Mesh网络中的路由可靠性和适应性，特别是在无基础设施环境中，传输成功率优先于延迟限制。

Abstract: Bluetooth-based mesh networks offer a promising infrastructure for offline
communication in emergency and resource constrained scenarios. However,
traditional routing strategies such as Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV)
often degrade under congestion and dynamic topological changes. This study
proposes a hybrid intelligent routing framework that augments AODV with
supervised machine learning to improve next-hop selection under varied network
constraints. The framework integrates four predictive models: a delivery
success classifier, a TTL regressor, a delay regressor, and a forwarder
suitability classifier, into a unified scoring mechanism that dynamically ranks
neighbors during multi-hop message transmission. A simulation environment with
stationary node deployments was developed, incorporating buffer constraints and
device heterogeneity to evaluate three strategies: baseline AODV, a partial
hybrid ML model (ABC), and the full hybrid ML model (ABCD). Across ten
scenarios, the Hybrid ABCD model achieves approximately 99.97 percent packet
delivery under these controlled conditions, significantly outperforming both
the baseline and intermediate approaches. The results demonstrate that
lightweight, explainable machine learning models can enhance routing
reliability and adaptability in Bluetooth mesh networks, particularly in
infrastructure-less environments where delivery success is prioritized over
latency constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传输协议在网络通信中至关重要，但面对多样化的应用、工作负载和网络架构，需要一种高级别、目标无关的编程抽象来简化开发和适应不同执行环境。

Method: 提出了一种高级别的传输协议编程框架TINF，使用类似C语言的约束构造，允许开发者以目标无关的方式编写传输协议。开发了两个TINF兼容的后端（DPDK和Linux eXpress DataPath），并在多个协议上进行了部署。

Result: TINF框架成功实现了多种传输协议，并验证了其在不同后端（DPDK和Linux eXpress DataPath）上的可行性和优势。

Conclusion: 通过TINF框架，我们展示了高级别、目标无关的传输层编程抽象的潜力，能够减少传输协议的开发工作量，并支持自动分析和形式验证。

Abstract: Transport protocols are fundamental to network communications, continuously
evolving to meet the demands of new applications, workloads, and network
architectures while running in a wide range of execution environments (a.k.a
targets). We argue that this diversity across protocols and targets calls for a
high-level, target-agnostic programming abstraction for the transport layer.
Specifically, we propose to specify transport protocols as high-level programs
that take an event and flow state as input, and using constrained C-like
constructs, produce the updated state along with target-agnostic instructions
for key transport operations such as data reassembly, packet generation and
scheduling, and timer manipulations.
  We show the benefits of our high-level transport programs by developing
multiple transport protocols in our programming framework called TINF,
developing two TINF- compliant backends, one in DPDK and one in Linux eXpress
DataPath, and deploying TINF programs for multiple protocols across both
backends. Inspired by the benefits unlocked by L2/L3 packet-processing
languages like P4, we believe target-agnostic transport programs can reduce the
development effort for transport protocols, enable automated analysis and
formal verification of the transport layer, and further research in
programmable targets for transport protocols.

Motivation: 随着可编程网络硬件的出现，将功能从通用CPU迁移到NIC成为可能，研究旨在探索Bluefield-3 NIC在负载均衡中的应用潜力。

Method: 研究通过在Bluefield-3上实现XenoFlow负载均衡器，评估其性能和局限性，特别是Flow Pipe条目对线速的影响。

Result: XenoFlow在Bluefield-3上实现了比基于eBPF的主机负载均衡器低44%的延迟，且在高负载下仍保持低延迟。

Conclusion: 论文展示了在Bluefield-3 NIC上实现的可编程负载均衡器XenoFlow的优势，尽管存在Flow Pipe条目的限制，但通过硬件卸载显著降低了延迟。

Abstract: With the advent of programmable network hardware, more and more
  functionality can be moved from software running on general purpose CPUs to
  the NIC. Early NICs only allowed offloading fixed functions like checksum
  computation. Recent NICs like the Nvidia Bluefield-3 allow a fully
  programmable dataplane. In this paper, we present our first steps towards a
  load balancer named XenoFlow running on the Bluefield-3. Furthermore, we
  show the capabilities and limitations of the Bluefield-3 eSwitch. Our
  results show that the Bluefield-3 will not achieve line rate with only 2
  entries in a Flow Pipe. However, we also show the adventages of hardware
  offloading on the NIC and being closer to the network. With XenoFlow, we
  achieve an 44% lower latency compared to a comparable eBPF-based load
  balancer running on the host. Furthermore, XenoFlow achieves this low
  latency even under high load.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的新型切换框架在超可靠通信（URC）环境中表现出色，提供了更高的服务可用性和能源效率。

Abstract: Efficient handover (HO) strategies are essential for maintaining the
stringent performance requirements of ultra-reliable communication (URC)
systems. This work introduces a novel HO framework designed from a
physical-layer perspective, where the decision-making process focuses on
determining the optimal time and location for performing HOs. Leveraging
extreme value theory (EVT) and statistical radio maps, the proposed method

framework ensures seamless HOs and improved system performance by facilitating
effective resource transitions and coordination across spatial locations while
incorporating mechanisms to mitigate the ping-pong effect. Comparative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频扩散模型在头发动态控制上的不足，实现更精细的头发动态渲染。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：首先通过物理模拟器将物理参数编码为每帧几何，然后提取每帧控制信号，最后将这些信号输入视频扩散模型生成具有所需头发动态的视频。

Result: 在10K视频数据集上训练后，ControlHair 在精确控制头发动态方面优于基于文本和姿态的基线方法。

Conclusion: ControlHair 提出了一种结合物理模拟器和条件视频扩散的混合框架，首次实现了可控的动态头发渲染。

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics,
diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent
video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack
fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid
framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion
to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage
pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into
per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals,
and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate
videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics
reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training
the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset,
ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering
precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of
ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic.
ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for
controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on
our website.

TL;DR: PowerGS是首个在3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中联合优化渲染和显示功耗的框架，通过识别等质量曲线和功耗最小点，实现了高达86%的功耗降低，同时保持质量。支持注视点渲染。代码已开源。

Motivation: 3DGS家族模型在功耗受限的扩展现实（XR）设备上效率不足，这些设备需要在瓦级功耗下运行。因此，需要一种方法来最小化3DGS的渲染和显示功耗，同时保持质量。

Method: PowerGS框架通过识别显示和渲染功耗景观中的等质量曲线，并在给定曲线上找到功耗最小点（具有闭式解），实现了功耗的联合优化。此外，它还支持注视点渲染以进一步节省功耗。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，PowerGS相比最先进的3DGS模型，总功耗降低了高达86%，且主观和客观质量损失最小。

Conclusion: PowerGS通过联合优化渲染和显示功耗，在3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）模型中实现了显著的功耗降低（高达86%），同时保持主观和客观质量的最小损失。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) combines classic image-based rendering,
pointbased graphics, and modern differentiable techniques, and offers an
interesting alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. 3DGS-family
models are far from efficient for power-constrained Extended Reality (XR)
devices, which need to operate at a Watt-level. This paper introduces PowerGS,
the first framework to jointly minimize the rendering and display power in 3DGS
under a quality constraint. We present a general problem formulation and show
that solving the problem amounts to 1) identifying the iso-quality curve(s) in
the landscape subtended by the display and rendering power and 2) identifying
the power-minimal point on a given curve, which has a closed-form solution
given a proper parameterization of the curves. PowerGS also readily supports
foveated rendering for further power savings. Extensive experiments and user
studies show that PowerGS achieves up to 86% total power reduction compared to
state-of-the-art 3DGS models, with minimal loss in both subjective and
objective quality. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖多视角视频恢复变形，限制了其在受限场景下的应用。因此，需要一种能够仅从单张图像重建变形的方法。

Method: 提出了DeformSplat框架，包含两项关键技术：Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching（连接3D高斯表示与2D像素观测）和Rigid Part Segmentation（初始化与细化，识别刚性区域）。

Result: 实验表明，DeformSplat在单图像变形重建上显著优于现有方法，并可扩展至帧插值和交互式物体操作等应用。

Conclusion: DeformSplat框架通过结合Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching和Rigid Part Segmentation技术，成功实现了仅从单张图像重建物体变形的目标，并在实验中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on
multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under
constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel
framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single
image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we
present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D
Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust
deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part
Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation
explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric
coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach
can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame
interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled
the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given
sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook
the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual
artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry
and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site
visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a
safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path
planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both
structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view
planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system,
including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method
generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to
effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective
optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity,
improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views.
Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for
texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale
synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach
effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture
reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at
low operational cost.

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as
basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches
due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills.
A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined
goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to
the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts
and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share
significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal
states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor
skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.
Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless
and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set
of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained
by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact
with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user
commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法在大型仓库中因关注点混合和分散而表现不佳，需要一种能够抽象和利用概念知识的新方法。

Method: RepoLens分为离线阶段（提取和丰富概念知识）和在线阶段（检索问题特定术语、聚类和排名关注点，并通过最小侵入性提示增强集成到定位工作流中）。

Result: 在SWE-Lancer-Loc基准测试中，RepoLens平均提升了22%的Hit@k和46%的Recall@k，并在不同模型中表现出广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: RepoLens通过抽象和利用代码仓库的概念知识，有效解决了大型仓库中的问题定位挑战，显著提升了现有工具的性能。

Abstract: Issue localization, which identifies faulty code elements such as files or
functions, is critical for effective bug fixing. While recent LLM-based and
LLM-agent-based approaches improve accuracy, they struggle in large-scale
repositories due to concern mixing, where relevant logic is buried in large
functions, and concern scattering, where related logic is dispersed across
files.
  To address these challenges, we propose RepoLens, a novel approach that
abstracts and leverages conceptual knowledge from code repositories. RepoLens
decomposes fine-grained functionalities and recomposes them into high-level
concerns, semantically coherent clusters of functionalities that guide LLMs. It
operates in two stages: an offline stage that extracts and enriches conceptual
knowledge into a repository-wide knowledge base, and an online stage that
retrieves issue-specific terms, clusters and ranks concerns by relevance, and
integrates them into localization workflows via minimally intrusive prompt
enhancements. We evaluate RepoLens on SWE-Lancer-Loc, a benchmark of 216 tasks
derived from SWE-Lancer. RepoLens consistently improves three state-of-the-art
tools, namely AgentLess, OpenHands, and mini-SWE-agent, achieving average gains
of over 22% in Hit@k and 46% in Recall@k for file- and function-level
localization. It generalizes across models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1) with
Hit@1 and Recall@10 gains up to 504% and 376%, respectively. Ablation studies
and manual evaluation confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the
constructed concerns.

Abstract: The IT industry provides supportive pathways such as returnship programs,
coding boot camps, and buddy systems for women re-entering their job after a
career break. Academia, however, offers limited opportunities to motivate women
to return. We propose a diverse multicultural research project investigating
the challenges faced by women with software engineering (SE) backgrounds
re-entering academia or related research roles after a career break. Career
disruptions due to pregnancy, immigration status, or lack of flexible work
options can significantly impact women's career progress, creating barriers for
returning as lecturers, professors, or senior researchers. Although many
companies promote gender diversity policies, such measures are less prominent
and often under-recognized within academic institutions. Our goal is to explore
the specific challenges women encounter when re-entering academic roles
compared to industry roles; to understand the institutional perspective,
including a comparative analysis of existing policies and opportunities in
different countries for women to return to the field; and finally, to provide
recommendations that support transparent hiring practices. The research project
will be carried out in multiple universities and in multiple countries to
capture the diverse challenges and policies that vary by location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excel功能复杂且用户需求多样，现有教程依赖专家手动编写，更新成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 框架首先实例化任务，然后通过执行代理（Execution Agent）在Excel中规划并执行解决方案，收集构建教程所需的中间产物，最终生成结构化的Excel文档和视频演示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在任务执行成功率上比现有最佳基线提高了8.5%，生成的教程在可读性和教学效果上表现优异，且自动化流程将时间成本降至专家编写的1/20。

Conclusion: 自动化教程生成框架显著提高了任务执行成功率（提升8.5%），并且在可读性和教学效果上接近或超越专家编写的教程，同时大幅降低了时间和人力成本。

Abstract: Excel is one of the most widely used productivity tools across domains,
offering rich functionality but also overwhelming users with its complexity.
This creates a persistent demand for tutorials to support effective usage.
However, existing tutorials are manually authored by experts, require frequent
updates after each software release, and incur substantial labor costs. Prior
work has not achieved fully automated tutorial generation, since existing
methods still depend on handcrafted operation sequences or example materials.
In this paper, we present the first framework for automatically generating
Excel tutorials directly from natural language task descriptions. Our framework
first instantiates the task. Then a central component of this framework,
Execution Agent, plans and executes the solution in Excel, and collects the
intermediate artifacts required for tutorial construction. These artifacts are
then transformed into both structured Excel documents and video demonstrations.
To build a comprehensive tutorial corpus, we collected 1,559 task descriptions
from real-world scenarios. In addition, we designed a systematic evaluation
framework that integrates assessments from both large language models (LLMs)
and human reviewers. Experimental results show that our framework improves task
execution success rates by 8.5% over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the
generated tutorials demonstrate superior readability and instructional
effectiveness, often approaching or surpassing expert-authored materials.
Importantly, the automated pipeline eliminates manual labor and reduces time
costs to 1/20 of expert authoring, making scalable and high-quality tutorial
generation practical for the first time.

TL;DR: AgentPack是一个包含130万条人机协作代码编辑的语料库，其数据质量优于传统人类提交数据，微调后的模型表现更优。


<details>

Motivation: 传统基于提交和拉取请求的代码编辑数据存在噪音（如提交信息简略、混杂无关编辑等），而人机协作的代码编辑更聚焦且目标明确，其提交信息由LLM生成，更详细地表达了意图和原理。

Method: 介绍了AgentPack，一个包含130万条由Claude Code、OpenAI Codex和Cursor Agent共同创作的代码编辑的语料库，并详细描述了其识别和筛选流程。

Result: 量化了这些代理的采用趋势，分析了编辑的结构特性，并证明基于AgentPack微调的模型优于仅基于人类提交数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 使用AgentPack微调的模型在代码编辑任务上表现优于仅基于人类提交数据训练的模型，展示了利用软件工程代理公开数据训练未来代码编辑模型的潜力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models for code editing has typically relied on
mining commits and pull requests. The working hypothesis has been that commit
messages describe human intent in natural language, and patches to code
describe the changes that implement that intent. However, much of the
previously collected data is noisy: commit messages are terse, human-written
commits commingle several unrelated edits, and many commits come from simple,
rule-based bots.
  The recent adoption of software engineering agents changes this landscape.
Code changes co-authored by humans and agents tend to be more narrowly scoped
and focused on clearer goals. Their commit messages, generated by LLMs,
articulate intent and rationale in much greater detail. Moreover, when these
changes land in public repositories, they are implicitly filtered by humans:
maintainers discard low-quality commits to their projects.
  We present AgentPack, a corpus of 1.3M code edits co-authored by Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex, and Cursor Agent across public GitHub projects up to mid-August
2025. We describe the identification and curation pipeline, quantify adoption
trends of these agents, and analyze the structural properties of the edits.
Finally, we show that models fine-tuned on AgentPack can outperform models
trained on prior human-only commit corpora, highlighting the potential of using
public data from software engineering agents to train future code-editing
models.

Motivation: 尽管许多调优器利用代理模型来加速配置调优过程，但先前研究发现模型准确性可能具有误导性，这引发了对代理模型在配置调优中作用的未解问题。本文旨在系统探索和讨论这一问题，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过基于适应度景观分析的新视角，本文提出了一个理论作为评估模型在调优中实用性的替代方法，并进行了涉及多达27,000个案例的广泛实证研究。

Result: 实证研究表明，Model4Tune在79%-82%的情况下显著优于随机猜测，为配置调优提供了有效的自动化工具。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Model4Tune，一个自动化预测工具，用于估计在未预见系统中哪种模型-调优器组合最佳，无需昂贵的调优器分析。结果表明，Model4Tune在79%-82%的情况下显著优于随机猜测，为配置调优提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: To efficiently tune configuration for better system performance (e.g.,
latency), many tuners have leveraged a surrogate model to expedite the process
instead of solely relying on the profoundly expensive system measurement. As
such, it is naturally believed that we need more accurate models. However, the
fact of accuracy can lie-a somewhat surprising finding from prior work-has left
us many unanswered questions regarding what role the surrogate model plays in
configuration tuning. This paper provides the very first systematic exploration
and discussion, together with a resolution proposal, to disclose the many faces
of surrogate models for configuration tuning, through the novel perspective of
fitness landscape analysis. We present a theory as an alternative to accuracy
for assessing the model usefulness in tuning, based on which we conduct an
extensive empirical study involving up to 27,000 cases. Drawing on the above,
we propose Model4Tune, an automated predictive tool that estimates which
model-tuner pairs are the best for an unforeseen system without expensive tuner
profiling. Our results suggest that Moldel4Tune, as one of the first of its
kind, performs significantly better than random guessing in 79%-82% of the
cases. Our results not only shed light on the possible future research
directions but also offer a practical resolution that can assist practitioners
in evaluating the most useful model for configuration tuning.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SecureAgentBench是一个用于严格评估代码代理安全代码生成能力的基准测试，结果显示当前代理在生成安全代码方面存在显著不足，需进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估代码代理生成代码的安全性方面存在不足，往往忽略了漏洞引入的真实上下文或采用狭窄的评估协议。因此，需要一种更全面的方法来评估代码代理的安全代码生成能力。

Method: SecureAgentBench包含105个编码任务，每个任务包括（i）需要在大规模仓库中进行多文件编辑的现实任务设置，（ii）基于真实世界开源漏洞的对齐上下文，以及（iii）结合功能测试、漏洞检查（通过概念验证利用）和静态分析新引入漏洞的全面评估。

Result: 评估结果显示，当前代码代理在生成安全代码方面表现不佳，最好的代理SWE-agent（由DeepSeek-V3.1支持）仅达到15.2%的正确且安全的解决方案。一些代理虽然能生成功能正确的代码，但仍会引入漏洞，甚至包括新漏洞。显式安全指令的加入并未显著改善安全编码。

Conclusion: SecureAgentBench被确立为一个严格的基准测试，用于评估代码代理在安全代码生成方面的能力，并为利用大型语言模型（LLM）进行更可靠的软件开发迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming
software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and
repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a
critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain
insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities
were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture
either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore
introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to
rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each
task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in
large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source
vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii)
comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability
checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced
vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents
(SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7
Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents
struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent
supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions,
(ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce
vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding
explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure
coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish
SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step
toward more reliable software development with LLMs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SK2Decompile是一种两阶段反编译方法，通过结构恢复和标识符命名模型，结合强化学习，显著提升了反编译的正确性和可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的反编译器在有效呈现程序的源代码结构及原始标识符方面存在局限。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先通过结构恢复模型将二进制代码转换为中间表示（IR），保留控制流和数据结构；其次通过标识符命名模型生成反映程序语义的有意义标识符。两个阶段均使用强化学习优化模型表现。

Result: SK2Decompile在正确性和可读性方面均取得显著提升。

Conclusion: SK2Decompile显著优于现有基线方法，在HumanEval数据集上实现了21.6%的平均重新执行率提升，在GitHub2025基准测试中实现了29.4%的R2I改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising approach for binary
decompilation. However, the existing LLM-based decompilers still are somewhat
limited in effectively presenting a program's source-level structure with its
original identifiers. To mitigate this, we introduce SK2Decompile, a novel
two-phase approach to decompile from the skeleton (semantic structure) to the
skin (identifier) of programs. Specifically, we first apply a Structure
Recovery model to translate a program's binary code to an Intermediate
Representation (IR) as deriving the program's "skeleton", i.e., preserving
control flow and data structures while obfuscating all identifiers with generic
placeholders. We also apply reinforcement learning to reward the model for
producing program structures that adhere to the syntactic and semantic rules
expected by compilers. Second, we apply an Identifier Naming model to produce
meaningful identifiers which reflect actual program semantics as deriving the
program's "skin". We train the Identifier Naming model with a separate
reinforcement learning objective that rewards the semantic similarity between
its predictions and the reference code. Such a two-phase decompilation process
facilitates advancing the correctness and readability of decompilation
independently. Our evaluations indicate that SK2Decompile, significantly
outperforms the SOTA baselines, achieving 21.6% average re-executability rate
gain over GPT-5-mini on the HumanEval dataset and 29.4% average R2I improvement
over Idioms on the GitHub2025 benchmark.

TL;DR: TITAN是一个LLM驱动的智能MMORPG测试框架，通过感知抽象、动作优化、长时程推理和错误检测四大组件，显著提升了任务完成率和错误检测性能，并成功应用于实际游戏QA流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动化游戏测试方法在MMORPG的复杂和开放环境中难以实现高状态覆盖率和效率，而现有LLM游戏玩法方法在理解复杂游戏状态-动作空间和长复杂任务方面推理能力有限。

Method: TITAN框架包含四个关键组件：高维游戏状态的感知与抽象、可用动作的主动优化与优先级排序、带动作轨迹记忆和反思自修正的长时程推理，以及基于LLM的预言机用于检测潜在功能与逻辑错误并提供诊断报告。

Result: 在两大商业MMORPG上的实验显示，TITAN实现了显著更高的任务完成率（95%）和错误检测性能，且检测到四个先前未知的错误。此外，TITAN已部署于八个实际游戏QA流程中。

Conclusion: TITAN作为一个LLM驱动的智能MMORPG测试框架，在任务完成率和错误检测性能上显著优于现有自动化游戏测试方法，并成功部署于实际游戏QA流程中，展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Testing MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) is a
critical yet labor-intensive task in game development due to their complexity
and frequent updating nature. Traditional automated game testing approaches
struggle to achieve high state coverage and efficiency in these rich,
open-ended environments, while existing LLM-based game-playing approaches are
limited to shallow reasoning ability in understanding complex game state-action
spaces and long-complex tasks. To address these challenges, we propose TITAN,
an effective LLM-driven agent framework for intelligent MMORPG testing. TITAN
incorporates four key components to: (1) perceive and abstract high-dimensional
game states, (2) proactively optimize and prioritize available actions, (3)
enable long-horizon reasoning with action trace memory and reflective
self-correction, and (4) employ LLM-based oracles to detect potential
functional and logic bugs with diagnostic reports.
  We implement the prototype of TITAN and evaluate it on two large-scale
commercial MMORPGs spanning both PC and mobile platforms. In our experiments,
TITAN achieves significantly higher task completion rates (95%) and bug
detection performance compared to existing automated game testing approaches.
An ablation study further demonstrates that each core component of TITAN
contributes substantially to its overall performance. Notably, TITAN detects
four previously unknown bugs that prior testing approaches fail to identify. We
provide an in-depth discussion of these results, which offer guidance for new
avenues of advancing intelligent, general-purpose testing systems. Moreover,
TITAN has been deployed in eight real-world game QA pipelines, underscoring its
practical impact as an LLM-driven game testing framework.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文首次系统研究了用户提示变化对LLM生成代码中库幻觉的影响，发现LLM对自然提示变化极为脆弱，需紧急防范相关风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在生成代码时经常出现幻觉，尤其是虚构不存在的库。这种幻觉不仅误导开发者，还可能破坏构建并暴露系统于供应链威胁。目前缺乏关于真实世界提示变化如何影响幻觉率的研究。

Method: 评估了六种不同的LLM，研究了两类幻觉：库名幻觉（无效导入）和库成员幻觉（有效库中的无效调用）。分析了开发论坛中提取的真实用户语言及不同程度的用户错误（如拼写错误和完全虚构的名称/成员）对幻觉率的影响。

Result: 研究发现：库名中的单字符拼写错误导致高达26%的任务出现幻觉，虚构库名被接受率高达99%，时间相关提示导致幻觉率高达84%。提示工程虽有助于缓解幻觉，但效果不一致且依赖LLM。

Conclusion: 论文强调了LLM在自然提示变化下的脆弱性，并呼吁急需防范库相关幻觉及其潜在利用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they
continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library
hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break
builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting.
Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how
real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present
the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library
hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two
hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library
member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how
realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of
varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake
names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic
vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger
hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to
99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of
tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but
remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of
LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards
against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.

Motivation: 随着语言模型在软件工程中的应用日益广泛，其推理过程引发的环境问题受到关注。此前研究关注硬件选择和提示长度，但忽略了语言复杂性对可持续性的影响。

Method: 本研究采用实证方法，使用开源小型语言模型进行需求分类，通过改变提示的可读性来研究其对能源消耗和性能的影响。

Result: 研究结果表明，提示的可读性对环境影响和性能有显著影响，揭示了二者之间的权衡。简单提示可在不显著降低F1分数的情况下减少能源成本。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，通过简化提示的可读性，可以在不明显影响F1分数的情况下降低能源成本，为绿色AI议程中的可持续提示设计提供了实践指导和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Language Models are increasingly applied in software engineering, yet their
inference raises growing environmental concerns. Prior work has examined
hardware choices and prompt length, but little attention has been paid to
linguistic complexity as a sustainability factor. This paper introduces Green
Prompt Engineering, framing linguistic complexity as a design dimension that
can influence energy consumption and performance. We conduct an empirical study
on requirement classification using open-source Small Language Models, varying
the readability of prompts. Our results reveal that readability affects
environmental sustainability and performance, exposing trade-offs between them.
For practitioners, simpler prompts can reduce energy costs without a
significant F1-score loss; for researchers, it opens a path toward guidelines
and studies on sustainable prompt design within the Green AI agenda.

Method: 提出了一种统一的表示方法来支持任意用户定义的更新策略，并设计了一种依赖分析算法。此外，通过利用Horn子句的局部结构简化消息传递，对消息进行分组以减少warp发散，从而更好地利用GPU资源。

Conclusion: 本文提出的GPU加速LBP算法在程序分析中表现出色，平均速度提升显著，同时保持了高准确性。

Abstract: Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) is a widely used approximate inference
algorithm in probabilistic graphical models, with applications in computer
vision, error correction codes, protein folding, program analysis, etc.
However, LBP faces significant computational challenges when applied to
large-scale program analysis. While GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) parallel
computing provides a promising solution, existing approaches lack support for
flexible update strategies and have yet to integrate logical constraints with
GPU acceleration, leading to suboptimal practical performance.
  This paper presents a GPU-accelerated LBP algorithm for program analysis. To
support the diverse update strategies required by users, we propose a unified
representation for specifying arbitrary user-defined update strategies, along
with a dependency analysis algorithm. Furthermore, building on previous work
that leverages the local structure of Horn clauses to simplify message passing,
we group messages to minimize warp divergence and better utilize GPU resources.
Experimental results on datarace analysis over eight real-world Java programs
show that our approach achieves an average speedup of $2.14\times$ over the
state-of-the-art sequential approach and $5.56\times$ over the state-of-the-art
GPU-based approach, while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing is a cornerstone of Autonomous Driving System (ADS)
development, offering safe and scalable evaluation across diverse driving
scenarios. However, discrepancies between simulated and real-world behavior,
known as the reality gap, challenge the transferability of test results to
deployed systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study
comparing four representative testing modalities: Software-in-the-Loop (SiL),
Vehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and full real-world testing.
Using a small-scale physical vehicle equipped with real sensors (camera and
LiDAR) and its digital twin, we implement each setup and evaluate two ADS
architectures (modular and end-to-end) across diverse indoor driving scenarios
involving real obstacles, road topologies, and indoor environments. We
systematically assess the impact of each testing modality along three
dimensions of the reality gap: actuation, perception, and behavioral fidelity.
Our results show that while SiL and ViL setups simplify critical aspects of
real-world dynamics and sensing, MR testing improves perceptual realism without
compromising safety or control. Importantly, we identify the conditions under
which failures do not transfer across testing modalities and isolate the
underlying dimensions of the gap responsible for these discrepancies. Our
findings offer actionable insights into the respective strengths and
limitations of each modality and outline a path toward more robust and
transferable validation of autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 探讨情境特定教学对初学者在错误定位技能上的影响。

Method: 进行了为期八周的纵向研究，设置了四种条件：无指导（G1）、抽象指南（G2）、具体步骤（G3）以及将具体步骤与问题特定细节配对的情境特定教学（G4）。

Result: G4组在正确率和完成时间上表现最佳，达到80%的正确率且完成时间稳定在13-15分钟，显著优于其他组。

Conclusion: 情境特定的教学比抽象指南或情境无关的步骤能更快地掌握技能并增强记忆。

Abstract: Bug localization is a critical skill, yet novices often lack systematic
approaches. Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps;
the impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week
longitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract
guidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that
pairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4).
Forty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5).
Each session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element
containing a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to
completion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and
strategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to
completion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other
groups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p <
0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other
groups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses
showed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants
internalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that
context-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger
retention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions
produced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized
performance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may
bridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more
equitable path for novices.

challenging, particularly when the reports are incomplete and the modern UI
exhibits high combinatorial complexity. Existing approaches based on
reinforcement learning or large language models (LLMs) exhibit limitations in
such scenarios. They struggle to infer unobserved steps and reconstruct the
underlying user action sequences to navigate the vast UI interaction space,
primarily due to limited goal-directed reasoning and planning. We present
TreeMind, a novel technique that integrates LLMs with a customized Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to achieve strategic UI exploration in bug
reproduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine
external decision-making with LLM semantic reasoning for reliable bug
reproduction. We formulate the reproduction task as a target-driven search
problem, leveraging MCTS as the core planning mechanism to iteratively refine
action sequences. To enhance MCTS with semantic reasoning, we introduce two
LLM-guided agents with distinct roles: Expander generates top-k promising
actions based on the current UI state and exploration history, while Simulator
estimates the likelihood that each action leads toward successful reproduction.
By incorporating multi-modal UI inputs and advanced prompting techniques,
TreeMind conducts feedback-aware navigation that identifies missing but
essential user actions and incrementally reconstructs the reproduction paths.
We evaluate TreeMind on a dataset of 93 real-world Android bug reports from
three widely-used benchmarks. Experimental results show that it significantly
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in reproduction success rate. A
real-world case study indicates that integrating LLM reasoning with MCTS-based
planning is a compelling direction for automated bug reproduction.

TL;DR: AFD通过混合方法精确建模自定义分配函数，显著提升指针分析精度，减少别名集大小，并发现新内存错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指针分析方法普遍忽视自定义分配函数，导致别名分析粗糙和精度下降。

Method: AFD采用混合方法：利用值流分析检测简单包装器，并借助大型语言模型（LLM）推理具有副作用的复杂分配模式。

Result: 在15个真实C项目中识别了600多个自定义分配函数，集成AFD后建模堆对象增加26倍，别名集大小减少39%，运行时开销仅1.4倍。此外，改进的分析提升了间接调用解析能力，并发现了17个之前未检测到的内存错误。

Conclusion: AFD技术通过精确建模自定义分配函数，显著提升了指针分析的精度和实用性，为大型软件系统中的指针分析提供了一条可扩展且实用的路径。

Abstract: Pointer analysis is foundational for many static analysis tasks, yet its
effectiveness is often hindered by imprecise modeling of heap allocations,
particularly in C/C++ programs where user-defined allocation functions (AFs)
are pervasive. Existing approaches largely overlook these custom allocators,
leading to coarse aliasing and reduced analysis precision. In this paper, we
present AFD, a novel technique that enhances pointer analysis by automatically
identifying and modeling custom allocation functions. AFD employs a hybrid
approach: it uses value-flow analysis to detect straightforward wrappers and
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason about more complex allocation
patterns with side effects. This targeted enhancement enables precise modeling
of heap objects at each call site, achieving context-sensitivity-like benefits
without the associated overhead. We evaluate AFD on 15 real-world C projects,
identifying over 600 custom AFs. Integrating AFD into a baseline pointer
analysis yields a 26x increase in modeled heap objects and a 39% reduction in
alias set sizes, with only 1.4x runtime overhead. Furthermore, our enhanced
analysis improves indirect call resolution and uncovers 17 previously
undetected memory bugs. These results demonstrate that precise modeling of
custom allocation functions offers a scalable and practical path to improving
pointer analysis in large software systems.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效算法，用于高维分布间的最优传输，解决了计算瓶颈并实现了维度无关的传输成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高维分布间的最优传输问题，旨在设计高效的算法，使得传输时间仅依赖于维度而非分布的完整表示大小，解决实际应用中的计算瓶颈。

Method: 通过引入‘顺序可采样’的新概念，并结合Knothe-Rosenblatt传输成本，设计了一个通用算法。对于高斯分布，利用成员资格预言机访问条件集，构建了顺序采样器。

Result: 算法能够在多项式时间内完成传输，并控制计算误差。对于高斯分布，实现了维度无关的传输成本，解决了Etesami等人提出的开放性问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种高效算法，用于在高维空间中实现最优传输，特别是在处理乘积分布时，能够以多项式时间完成传输，并控制计算误差。此外，该算法还解决了高斯分布传输中的计算浓度问题。

Abstract: We study optimal transport between two high-dimensional distributions
$\mu,\nu$ in $R^n$ from an algorithmic perspective: given $x \sim \mu$, find a
close $y \sim \nu$ in $poly(n)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of $x,y$.
Thus, running time depends on the dimension rather than the full representation
size of $\mu,\nu$. Our main result is a general algorithm for transporting any
product distribution $\mu$ to any $\nu$ with cost $\Delta + \delta$ under
$\ell_p^p$, where $\Delta$ is the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport cost and $\delta$
is a computational error decreasing with runtime. This requires $\nu$ to be
"sequentially samplable" with bounded average sampling cost, a new but natural
notion.
  We further prove:
  An algorithmic version of Talagrand's inequality for transporting the
standard Gaussian $\Phi^n$ to arbitrary $\nu$ under squared Euclidean cost. For
$\nu = \Phi^n$ conditioned on a set $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$, we
construct the sequential sampler in expected time $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ using
membership oracle access to $\mathcal{S}$. This yields an algorithmic transport
from $\Phi^n$ to $\Phi^n|\mathcal{S}$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time and
expected squared distance $O(\log 1/\varepsilon)$, optimal for general
$\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$.
  As corollary, we obtain the first computational concentration result (Etesami
et al. SODA 2020) for Gaussian measure under Euclidean distance with
dimension-independent transportation cost, resolving an open question of
Etesami et al. Specifically, for any $\mathcal{S}$ of Gaussian measure
$\varepsilon$, most $\Phi^n$ samples can be mapped to $\mathcal{S}$ within
distance $O(\sqrt{\log 1/\varepsilon})$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种在MPC和半流模型中高效寻找有向图近似最密子图的方法，显著改进了现有技术，并通过实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Finding dense subgraphs is a fundamental problem with applications to
community detection, clustering, and data mining. Our work focuses on finding
approximate densest subgraphs in directed graphs in computational models for
processing massive data. We consider two such models: Massively Parallel
Computation (MPC) and semi-streaming. We show how to find a
$(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$ MPC rounds with
sublinear memory per machine. This improves the state-of-the-art results by
Bahmani et al. (WAW 2014) and Mitrovi\'c & Pan (ICML 2024). Moreover, we show
how to find an $O(\log n)$-approximation in a single pass in semi-streaming.
This is in stark contrast to prior work, which implies
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/6})$-approximation for a single pass; a better
approximation is known only for randomized streams (Mitrovi\'c & Pan). This is
the first deterministic single-pass semi-streaming algorithm for the densest
subgraph problem, both for undirected and directed graphs. Our semi-streaming
approach is also an insertion-only dynamic algorithm, attaining the first
directed densest subgraph algorithm with $O(\log^2 n)$ worst-case update time
while using sub-linear memory. We empirically evaluate our approaches in two
ways. First, we illustrate that our single-pass semi-streaming algorithm
performs much better than the theoretical guarantee. Specifically, its
approximation on temporal datasets matches the $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation
of an $O(\log n)$-pass algorithm by Bahmani et al. (VLDB 2012). Second, we
demonstrate that our MPC algorithm requires fewer rounds than prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一采样在数据摘要中效率高，但其在聚类问题中构建核心集的有效性尚未明确，现有核心集概念（强核心集）难以通过统一采样高效构建。

Method: 通过统一采样构建稳定核心集，针对1-中位数问题在ℓ1度量下的核心集进行了理论分析。

Result: 理论证明在ℓ1度量下，大小为O(ε−2logd)的统一采样能以高概率生成稳定核心集，并扩展至其他相关度量（如Kendall-tau和Jaccard）。

Conclusion: 稳定核心集的概念填补了弱核心集和强核心集之间的空白，统一采样方法在构建高效核心集方面具有潜力，实验验证了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Uniform sampling is a highly efficient method for data summarization.
However, its effectiveness in producing coresets for clustering problems is not
yet well understood, primarily because it generally does not yield a strong
coreset, which is the prevailing notion in the literature. We formulate
\emph{stable coresets}, a notion that is intermediate between the standard
notions of weak and strong coresets, and effectively combines the broad
applicability of strong coresets with highly efficient constructions, through
uniform sampling, of weak coresets. Our main result is that a uniform sample of
size $O(\epsilon^{-2}\log d)$ yields, with high constant probability, a stable
coreset for $1$-median in $\mathbb{R}^d$ under the $\ell_1$ metric. We then
leverage the powerful properties of stable coresets to easily derive new
coreset constructions, all through uniform sampling, for $\ell_1$ and related
metrics, such as Kendall-tau and Jaccard. We also show applications to fair
clustering and to approximation algorithms for $k$-median problems in these
metric spaces. Our experiments validate the benefits of stable coresets in
practice, in terms of both construction time and approximation quality.

<details>

Motivation: 最大团问题是NP难问题，执行时间较长。研究旨在通过跳过搜索空间中的无关部分来提高效率。

Method: 采用了四种优化技术：(i) 高效的惰性构建图表示；(ii) 搜索前的过滤；(iii) 高效的提前退出交集算法；(iv) 算法选择优化。

Result: 优化后的算法在性能上显著优于PMC和MC-BRB，分别实现了最高38.9倍和11倍的加速。

Conclusion: 本文提出的优化技术在最大团搜索中实现了显著的性能提升，相比PMC和MC-BRB算法分别实现了最高38.9倍和11倍的加速。

Abstract: The maximum clique (MC) problem is a challenging graph mining problem which,
due to its NP-hard nature, can take a substantial amount of execution time. The
MC problem is dominated by set intersection operations similar to Maximal
Clique Enumeration, however it differs in requiring to find only a clique of
maximum size. As such, key to the problem is to demonstrate efficiently that a
particular part of the search space does not contain a maximum clique, allowing
to skip over major parts of the search space. We present a number of techniques
to optimize MC search in light of leaving major parts of the search space
unvisited, including (i) an efficient, lazily constructed graph representation;
(ii) filtering prior to initiating a detailed search; (iii) efficient
early-exit intersection algorithms; (iv) exploiting algorithmic choice. These
techniques result in a speedup of up to 38.9x compared to PMC, which is the
most comparable algorithm, and a speedup up to 11x over MC-BRB.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文研究了在线消防员问题在含循环图上的表现，证明了竞争比下限并提出了高效算法，尤其在消防员成对释放时竞争复杂度大幅降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是扩展在线消防员问题的研究范围，从树结构到包含循环的图，以探索循环对算法性能的影响。

Method: 论文首先证明了在蝌蚪图上，任何确定性在线算法的竞争比不低于Ω(√n)。随后提出了一种O(√n)-competitive算法，适用于1-几乎树和仙人掌图。最后，研究了消防员成对释放时的变体。

Result: 论文证明了在蝌蚪图上算法的竞争比下限为Ω(√n)，并提出了适用于1-几乎树和仙人掌图的O(√n)-competitive算法。此外，消防员成对释放时，问题最多为3-competitive。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，即使在包含多个循环的仙人掌图上，在线消防员问题仍然保持O(√n)-competitive。此外，当消防员成对释放时，竞争复杂度显著降低，最多为3-competitive。

Abstract: It is known that the online firefighting is 2-competitive on trees
(Coupechoux et al. 2016), which suggests that the problem is relatively easy on
trees. We extend the study to graphs containing cycles. We first show that the
presence of cycles gives a strong advantage to the adversary: cycles create
situations where the algorithm and the optimal solution operate on different
game states, and the adversary can exploit the uncertainty in the firefighter
sequence to trap the algorithm. Specifically, we prove that even on a tadpole
graph (a cycle with a tail path), no deterministic online algorithm achieves a
competitive ratio better than $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, where n is the number of
vertices. We then propose an $O(\sqrt{n})$-competitive algorithm for 1-almost
trees, which contain at most one cycle and generalize tadpole graphs. We
further generalize this algorithm to cactus graphs, in which multiple cycles
may appear, but no two share more than one vertex, and show that the online
firefighting problem on cactus graphs remains $O(\sqrt{n})$-competitive.
Finally, since cactus graphs have treewidth at most 2, we study a variant where
firefighters are released in pairs, that is, each round an even number of
firefighters is available. Surprisingly, in this setting the competitive
complexity is significantly reduced, and we prove that the problem is at most
3-competitive.
  The main technical challenges lie in both algorithm design and analysis,
since the algorithm and the optimal solution may break different cycles and
thus operate on different residual graphs. To overcome this difficulty, we
design a charging framework that carefully partitions the vertices saved by the
optimal solution and charges them to the vertices saved by the algorithm.
Namely, the charging scheme is carefully constructed to ensure that each vertex
saved by the algorithm is charged at most a constant number of times.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决是否能对所有模式P的细粒度复杂度进行分类的问题，特别是针对主导P模式的检测。

Method: 论文定义了一个图参数ρ(P)，并基于正交向量假设，推导出检测主导P模式的最优运行时间。

Result: 研究发现，除三角形K3外，所有模式P的检测复杂度可以用参数ρ(P)来分类，并给出了最优运行时间的表达式。

Conclusion: 该论文通过定义图参数ρ(P)，为除三角形K3外的所有模式P提供了细粒度复杂度的分类，假设正交向量假设成立。

Abstract: We consider the following generalization of dominating sets: Let $G$ be a
host graph and $P$ be a pattern graph $P$. A dominating $P$-pattern in $G$ is a
subset $S$ of vertices in $G$ that (1) forms a dominating set in $G$ \emph{and}
(2) induces a subgraph isomorphic to $P$. The graph theory literature studies
the properties of dominating $P$-patterns for various patterns $P$, including
cliques, matchings, independent sets, cycles and paths. Previous work
(Kunnemann, Redzic 2024) obtains algorithms and conditional lower bounds for
detecting dominating $P$-patterns particularly for $P$ being a $k$-clique, a
$k$-independent set and a $k$-matching. Their results give conditionally tight
lower bounds if $k$ is sufficiently large (where the bound depends the matrix
multiplication exponent $\omega$). We ask: Can we obtain a classification of
the fine-grained complexity for \emph{all} patterns $P$?
  Indeed, we define a graph parameter $\rho(P)$ such that if $\omega=2$, then
\[ \left(n^{\rho(P)} m^{\frac{|V(P)|-\rho(P)}{2}}\right)^{1\pm o(1)} \] is the
optimal running time assuming the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis, for all
patterns $P$ except the triangle $K_3$. Here, the host graph $G$ has $n$
vertices and $m=\Theta(n^\alpha)$ edges, where $1\le \alpha \le 2$.
  The parameter $\rho(P)$ is closely related (but sometimes different) to a
parameter $\delta(P) = \max_{S\subseteq V(P)} |S|-|N(S)|$ studied in (Alon
1981) to tightly quantify the maximum number of occurrences of induced
subgraphs isomorphic to $P$. Our results stand in contrast to the lack of a
full fine-grained classification of detecting an arbitrary (not necessarily
\emph{dominating}) induced $P$-pattern.

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require
frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is
challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy
access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy
system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained
viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the
VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,
stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert
constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.
Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the
see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images
for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external
evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals
achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final
post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts
tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a new soft-rigid robotic platform,
"GeoGami". We leverage origami surface capabilities to achieve shape
contraction and to support locomotion with underactuated forms. A key challenge
is that origami surfaces have high degrees of freedom and typically require
many actuators; we address repeatability by integrating surface compliance. We
propose a mono-actuated GeoGami mobile platform that combines origami surface
compliance with a geometric compliant skeleton, enabling the robot to transform
and locomote using a single actuator. We demonstrate the robot, develop a
stiffness model, and describe the central gearbox mechanism. We also analyze
alternative cable-driven actuation methods for the skeleton to enable surface
transformation. Finally, we evaluate the GeoGami platform for capabilities,
including shape transformation and rolling. This platform opens new
capabilities for robots that change shape to access different environments and
that use shape transformation for locomotion.

Abstract: The safe operation of quadrotors in near-wall urban or indoor environments
(e.g., inspection and search-and-rescue missions) is challenged by unmodeled
aerodynamic effects arising from wall-proximity. It generates complex vortices
that induce destabilizing suction forces, potentially leading to hazardous
vibrations or collisions. This paper presents a comprehensive solution
featuring (1) a physics-based suction force model that explicitly characterizes
the dependency on both rotor speed and wall distance, and (2) a
suction-compensated model predictive control (SC-MPC) framework designed to
ensure accurate and stable trajectory tracking during wall-proximity
operations. The proposed SC-MPC framework incorporates an enhanced dynamics
model that accounts for suction force effects, formulated as a factor graph
optimization problem integrating system dynamics constraints, trajectory
tracking objectives, control input smoothness requirements, and actuator
physical limitations. The suction force model parameters are systematically
identified through extensive experimental measurements across varying
operational conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates SC-MPC's superior
performance, achieving 2.1 cm root mean squared error (RMSE) in X-axis and 2.0
cm RMSE in Y-axis position control - representing 74% and 79% improvements over
cascaded proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and 60% and 53%
improvements over standard MPC respectively. The corresponding mean absolute
error (MAE) metrics (1.2 cm X-axis, 1.4 cm Y-axis) similarly outperform both
baselines. The evaluation platform employs a ducted quadrotor design that
provides collision protection while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency. To
facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we have open-sourced our
complete implementation, available at

Abstract: Multi-robot target tracking is a fundamental problem that requires
coordinated monitoring of dynamic entities in applications such as precision
agriculture, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and security
surveillance. While Federated Learning (FL) has the potential to enhance
learning across multiple robots without centralized data aggregation, its use
in multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking remains largely
underexplored. Key challenges include limited onboard computational resources,
significant data heterogeneity in FL due to varying targets and the fields of
view, and the need for tight coupling between trajectory prediction and
multi-robot planning. In this paper, we introduce DroneFL, the first federated
learning framework specifically designed for efficient multi-UAV target
tracking. We design a lightweight local model to predict target trajectories
from sensor inputs, using a frozen YOLO backbone and a shallow transformer for
efficient onboard training. The updated models are periodically aggregated in
the cloud for global knowledge sharing. To alleviate the data heterogeneity
that hinders FL convergence, DroneFL introduces a position-invariant model
architecture with altitude-based adaptive instance normalization. Finally, we
fuse predictions from multiple UAVs in the cloud and generate optimal
trajectories that balance target prediction accuracy and overall tracking
performance. Our results show that DroneFL reduces prediction error by 6%-83%
and tracking distance by 0.4%-4.6% compared to a distributed non-FL framework.
In terms of efficiency, DroneFL runs in real time on a Raspberry Pi 5 and has
on average just 1.56 KBps data rate to the cloud.

task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation that
integrates symbolic search. Prior approaches, however, have largely treated
these domains as search utilities, with limited attention to their potential as
scalable sources of reasoning data. At the same time, progress in reasoning
LLMs has been driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, whose application
in robotics remains dependent on costly, human-curated datasets. We propose
Plan2Evolve, an LLM self-evolving framework in which the base model generates
planning domains that serve as engines for producing symbolic problem-plan
pairs as reasoning traces. These pairs are then transformed into extended CoT
trajectories by the same model through natural-language explanations, thereby
explicitly aligning symbolic planning structures with natural language
reasoning. The resulting data extend beyond the model's intrinsic planning
capacity, enabling model fine-tuning that yields a planning-enhanced LLM with
improved planning success, stronger cross-task generalization, and reduced
inference costs.

Abstract: Vision-based odometry has been widely adopted in autonomous driving owing to
its low cost and lightweight setup; however, its performance often degrades in
complex outdoor urban environments. To address these challenges, we propose
PL-VIWO2, a filter-based visual-inertial-wheel odometry system that integrates
an IMU, wheel encoder, and camera (supporting both monocular and stereo) for
long-term robust state estimation. The main contributions are: (i) a novel line
feature processing framework that exploits the geometric relationship between
2D feature points and lines, enabling fast and robust line tracking and
triangulation while ensuring real-time performance; (ii) an SE(2)-constrained
SE(3) wheel pre-integration method that leverages the planar motion
characteristics of ground vehicles for accurate wheel updates; and (iii) an
efficient motion consistency check (MCC) that filters out dynamic features by
jointly using IMU and wheel measurements. Extensive experiments on Monte Carlo
simulations and public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that PL-VIWO2
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
robustness.

Conclusion: 提出的自主无人机-四足机器人对接框架在GPS缺失环境中成功验证，能够在复杂地形（如超过17厘米的户外楼梯和超过30度的陡坡）上实现稳定对接。

Abstract: Autonomous docking between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and ground robots
is essential for heterogeneous systems, yet most existing approaches target
wheeled platforms whose limited mobility constrains exploration in complex
terrains. Quadruped robots offer superior adaptability but undergo frequent
posture variations, making it difficult to provide a stable landing surface for
UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose an autonomous UAV-quadruped
docking framework for GPS-denied environments. On the quadruped side, a Hybrid
Internal Model with Horizontal Alignment (HIM-HA), learned via deep
reinforcement learning, actively stabilizes the torso to provide a level
platform. On the UAV side, a three-phase strategy is adopted, consisting of
long-range acquisition with a median-filtered YOLOv8 detector, close-range
tracking with a constraint-aware controller that integrates a Nonsingular Fast
Terminal Sliding Mode Controller (NFTSMC) and a logarithmic Barrier Function
(BF) to guarantee finite-time error convergence under field-of-view (FOV)
constraints, and terminal descent guided by a Safety Period (SP) mechanism that
jointly verifies tracking accuracy and platform stability. The proposed
framework is validated in both simulation and real-world scenarios,
successfully achieving docking on outdoor staircases higher than 17 cm and
rough slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Supplementary materials and videos are

Motivation: 物体级SLAM因稀疏观测导致优化不足，传统方法依赖人工获取常识知识，费时且泛化性差。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于图的SLAM框架，集成LLMs提供的物体尺寸和方向等常识知识作为先验因素，特别在初始观测有限时发挥作用。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D和3RScan数据集上，系统比最新基线提升了36.8%的建图精度，并展示了实时性能。

Conclusion: 该论文通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）提供物体几何属性的常识知识，成功解决了物体级SLAM在稀疏观测下优化不足的问题，显著提升了地图构建的准确性。

Abstract: Object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which incorporates
semantic information for high-level scene understanding, faces challenges of
under-constrained optimization due to sparse observations. Prior work has
introduced additional constraints using commonsense knowledge, but obtaining
such priors has traditionally been labor-intensive and lacks generalizability
across diverse object categories. We address this limitation by leveraging
large language models (LLMs) to provide commonsense knowledge of object
geometric attributes, specifically size and orientation, as prior factors in a
graph-based SLAM framework. These priors are particularly beneficial during the
initial phase when object observations are limited. We implement a complete
pipeline integrating these priors, achieving robust data association on sparse
object-level features and enabling real-time object SLAM. Our system, evaluated
on the TUM RGB-D and 3RScan datasets, improves mapping accuracy by 36.8\% over
the latest baseline. Additionally, we present real-world experiments in the
supplementary video, demonstrating its real-time performance.

Motivation: 解决多物体场景中物体放置的稳定性挑战，包括避免穿透、精确表面接触和力平衡。

Method: 利用离线采样规划器收集多模态放置标签，训练扩散模型生成稳定放置，结合稳定性感知损失提高采样区域的稳定性。

Result: 在四个基准场景中，物理引导模型生成的放置对强力扰动的鲁棒性提高了56%，同时运行时间减少了47%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将稳定性直接集成到扩散模型的采样过程中，显著提高了放置的鲁棒性和效率，无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge
in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish
precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess
stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to
heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates
stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end,
we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement
labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion
model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a
geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based
generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss,
thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability.
Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning,
and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on
four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our
physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful
perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art
geometric method.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的强化学习框架通过结合预测信号和物理引导的密集奖励，成功实现了人形机器人在乒乓球中的高效表现，展示了其在真实机器人上的零样本部署潜力。

Abstract: Humanoid table tennis (TT) demands rapid perception, proactive whole-body
motion, and agile footwork under strict timing -- capabilities that remain
difficult for unified controllers. We propose a reinforcement learning
framework that maps ball-position observations directly to whole-body joint
commands for both arm striking and leg locomotion, strengthened by predictive
signals and dense, physics-guided rewards. A lightweight learned predictor, fed
with recent ball positions, estimates future ball states and augments the
policy's observations for proactive decision-making. During training, a
physics-based predictor supplies precise future states to construct dense,
informative rewards that lead to effective exploration. The resulting policy
attains strong performance across varied serve ranges (hit rate $\geq$ 96% and
success rate $\geq$ 92%) in simulations. Ablation studies confirm that both the
learned predictor and the predictive reward design are critical for end-to-end
learning. Deployed zero-shot on a physical Booster T1 humanoid with 23 revolute
joints, the policy produces coordinated lateral and forward-backward footwork
with accurate, fast returns, suggesting a practical path toward versatile,
competitive humanoid TT.

Motivation: 现有方法面临困境：模仿策略学习需要大量演示来覆盖任务变体，而模块化方法在动态场景中缺乏灵活性。

Method: VLBiMan 通过任务感知分解从单个人类示例中提取可重用技能，保留不变基元作为锚点，同时通过视觉语言基础动态调整可调组件。

Conclusion: VLBiMan 框架通过结合人类先验知识与视觉语言锚定的适应性，为无结构环境中的实用且多功能双臂操纵迈出了一步。

Abstract: Achieving generalizable bimanual manipulation requires systems that can learn
efficiently from minimal human input while adapting to real-world uncertainties
and diverse embodiments. Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy
learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while
modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan,
a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through
task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while
dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This
adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes,
object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging
semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system
inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and
asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across
tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in
demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional
generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3)
robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances,
and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from
human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without
retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation,
our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in
unstructured settings.

Method: 设计了一个配备定制末端执行器的机器人操纵器，并实施了五种受土耳其冰淇淋启发的欺骗策略，通过混合设计用户研究（91名参与者）评估欺骗和互动时长对用户体验的影响。

Result: 受土耳其冰淇淋启发的欺骗显著提高了享受和参与度，但降低了感知安全和信任，表明在多维方面存在结构化权衡。

Conclusion: 研究发现，在娱乐和互动导向的机器人设计中，游戏性欺骗可以作为一种有价值的策略，但需要权衡其对安全感和信任的潜在负面影响。

Abstract: Playful deception, a common feature in human social interactions, remains
underexplored in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Inspired by the Turkish Ice
Cream (TIC) vendor routine, we investigate how bounded, culturally familiar
forms of deception influence user trust, enjoyment, and engagement during
robotic handovers. We design a robotic manipulator equipped with a custom
end-effector and implement five TIC-inspired trick policies that deceptively
delay the handover of an ice cream-shaped object. Through a mixed-design user
study with 91 participants, we evaluate the effects of playful deception and
interaction duration on user experience. Results reveal that TIC-inspired
deception significantly enhances enjoyment and engagement, though reduces
perceived safety and trust, suggesting a structured trade-off across the
multi-dimensional aspects. Our findings demonstrate that playful deception can
be a valuable design strategy for interactive robots in entertainment and
engagement-focused contexts, while underscoring the importance of deliberate
consideration of its complex trade-offs. You can find more information,

Abstract: Despite growing interest in developing legged robots that emulate biological
locomotion for agile navigation of complex environments, acquiring a diverse
repertoire of skills remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing
methods can learn motion behaviors from expert data, but they often fail to
acquire multiple locomotion skills through a single policy and lack smooth
skill transitions. We propose a multi-skill learning framework based on
Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP), with the aim of enabling
quadruped robots to efficiently acquire a diverse set of locomotion skills from
expert demonstrations. Precise skill reconstruction is achieved through a novel
skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design. The overall framework
supports the active control and reuse of multiple skills, providing a practical
solution for learning generalizable policies in complex environments.

Conclusion: 结合博弈论和传统运动分类模型的方法能够更准确地预测车辆行为，尤其在车道变更场景中，这对于自适应巡航控制等决策系统至关重要。

Abstract: Conventional maneuver prediction methods use some sort of classification
model on temporal trajectory data to predict behavior of agents over a set time
horizon. Despite of having the best precision and recall, these models cannot
predict a lane change accurately unless they incorporate information about the
entire scene. Level-k game theory can leverage the human-like hierarchical
reasoning to come up with the most rational decisions each agent can make in a
group. This can be leveraged to model interactions between different vehicles
in presence of each other and hence compute the most rational decisions each
agent would make. The result of game theoretic evaluation can be used as a
"prior" or combined with a traditional motion-based classification model to
achieve more accurate predictions. The proposed approach assumes that the
states of the vehicles around the target lead vehicle are known. The module
will output the most rational maneuver prediction of the target vehicle based
on an online optimization solution. These predictions are instrumental in
decision making systems like Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or Traxen's
iQ-Cruise further improving the resulting fuel savings.

Abstract: Robotic manipulators capable of regulating both compliance and stiffness
offer enhanced operational safety and versatility. Here, we introduce Worm
Gear-based Adaptive Variable Elasticity (WAVE), a variable stiffness actuator
(VSA) that integrates a non-backdrivable worm gear. By decoupling the driving
motor from external forces using this gear, WAVE enables precise force
transmission to the joint, while absorbing positional discrepancies through
compliance. WAVE is protected from excessive loads by converting impact forces
into elastic energy stored in a spring. In addition, the actuator achieves
continuous joint stiffness modulation by changing the spring's precompression
length. We demonstrate these capabilities, experimentally validate the proposed
stiffness model, show that motor loads approach zero at rest--even under
external loading--and present applications using a manipulator with WAVE. This
outcome showcases the successful decoupling of external forces. The protective
attributes of this actuator allow for extended operation in contact-intensive
tasks, and for robust robotic applications in challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程操作任务涉及复杂的动作序列和对象交互，现有方法在泛化性和语义推理上表现不足，图像条件控制方法难以适应新任务。

Method: SAGE包含两个关键组件：基于场景图的任务规划器和解耦的结构图像编辑管道，前者利用VLMs和LLMs解析环境并推理场景状态转换序列，后者通过图像修复和合成将目标子目标图转换为对应图像。

Result: SAGE在多个长时程任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过结合语义场景图和结构图像编辑，显著提升了长时程操作任务的性能，实现了任务级语义推理与像素级视觉运动控制的桥接。

Abstract: Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental
challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object
interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning
and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential
capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective
goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including
traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or
sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods
struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a
novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon
Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural
representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging
task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also
facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE
consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses
VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded
scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing
pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a
corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance
on distinct long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: LCP通过轻量级神经网络优化不确定性集，在机器人任务中显著提升性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在机器人学中通常输出点估计，其置信度校准不佳，无法量化在新颖、噪声或分布外输入下的预测可靠性。

Method: LCP 使用轻量级神经网络函数替代固定的非一致性分数，利用几何、语义和任务特定特征生成上下文感知的不确定性集。

Result: LCP 在分类任务中减少了18%的预测集大小，在检测任务中缩小了52%的区间，路径规划安全性从72%提升至91%。在CIFAR-100和ImageNet上分类任务中实现了4.7-9.9%的预测集大小减少，在COCO、BDD100K和Cityscapes上检测任务中产生了46-54%更紧密的边界框。

Conclusion: Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP) 在多个机器人任务中显著优于标准CP和集成基线，提供了更小的预测集大小、更紧密的检测区间和更高的路径规划安全性，同时保持了轻量级和高效性。

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly
calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive
reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal
prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage
guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and
can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this
with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a
lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and
task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes
by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving
path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across
three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard
CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it
achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object
detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding
boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to
91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory)
and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained
autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and
15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being
7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型规划器对驾驶数据的长尾分布敏感，常见场景主导数据集，而危险或罕见场景稀疏。这种不平衡会导致模型偏向高频案例，在关键场景上性能下降。

Method: FlowDrive是一种基于流匹配的轨迹规划器，通过学习条件整流流，将噪声直接映射到轨迹分布中，仅需少量流匹配步骤。此外，还引入了调节引导，在流步骤间注入微小扰动，系统性增加轨迹多样性，同时保持场景一致性。

Result: 在nuPlan和interPlan基准测试中，FlowDrive在学习型规划器中取得了最先进的结果，接近基于规则优化的方法。FlowDrive*（加入调节引导和轻量后处理后）在几乎所有基准分割上实现了整体最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FlowDrive*通过引入调节引导和轻量后处理，实现了在几乎所有基准分割上的最先进性能，接近甚至超过基于规则优化的方法。

Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of
driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare
scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases
and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we
compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by
trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a
flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to
map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We
further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small
perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity
while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused
interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among
learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements.
After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it
achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark
splits.

Abstract: Constructing robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks is a long-standing
challenge within artificial intelligence. Approaches using generative methods,
particularly Diffusion Models, have gained attention due to their ability to
model continuous robotic trajectories for planning and control. However, we
show that these models struggle with long-horizon tasks that involve complex
decision-making and, in general, are prone to confusing different modes of
behavior, leading to failure. To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous
trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan.
We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and
continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In
addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible
trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial
and complete symbolic conditions.

TL;DR: EgoScaler extracts object manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos, enabling scalable VLA training with significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether VLAs can be trained directly from raw egocentric videos without costly expert-driven manual teleoperation or auxiliary annotations.

Method: The study leverages EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without auxiliary recordings, and applies it to four large-scale datasets to construct a new dataset for VLA pre-training.

Result: Pre-training on the new dataset improves task success rates by over 20%, performs competitively with real-robot datasets, and combining both yields further improvements.

Conclusion: Egocentric videos are a scalable and promising resource for advancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) research, as demonstrated by improved task success rates and competitive performance with real-robot datasets.

Abstract: Egocentric videos capture how humans manipulate objects and tools, providing
diverse motion cues for learning object manipulation. Unlike the costly,
expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable
alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training
robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed
hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be
trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this
challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object
manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary
recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets
and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing
a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a
state-of-the-art $\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot
environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves
task success rates by over 20\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the
performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and
(iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements.
These results demonstrate that egocentric videos constitute a promising and
scalable resource for advancing VLA research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管受自然启发的多自由度机械臂设计备受期待，但单自由度设计仍具有基础性优势，如简单性、鲁棒性、成本效益和效率。然而，单自由度系统在全周期运动范围内常受自碰撞限制。本研究旨在通过过约束连杆设计，实现能量高效、无自碰撞的运动多样性。

Abstract: While it is expected to build robotic limbs with multiple degrees of freedom
(DoF) inspired by nature, a single DoF design remains fundamental, providing
benefits that include, but are not limited to, simplicity, robustness,
cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Mechanisms, especially those with multiple
links and revolute joints connected in closed loops, play an enabling factor in
introducing motion diversity for 1-DoF systems, which are usually constrained
by self-collision during a full-cycle range of motion. This study presents a
novel computational approach to designing one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF)
overconstrained robotic limbs for a desired spatial trajectory, while achieving
energy-efficient, self-collision-free motion in full-cycle rotations. Firstly,
we present the geometric optimization problem of linkage-based robotic limbs in
a generalized formulation for self-collision-free design. Next, we formulate
the spatial trajectory generation problem with the overconstrained linkages by
optimizing the similarity and dynamic-related metrics. We further optimize the
geometric shape of the overconstrained linkage to ensure smooth and
collision-free motion driven by a single actuator. We validated our proposed
method through various experiments, including personalized automata and
bio-inspired hexapod robots. The resulting hexapod robot, featuring
overconstrained robotic limbs, demonstrated outstanding energy efficiency
during forward walking.

Abstract: As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile
robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in
autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based
methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient
and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing
ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which
may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence
of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic
environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy.
To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR
odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed
coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the
initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by
comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error
between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the
current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted
to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based
on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane
adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map,
achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds.
Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy
of LiDAR odometry.

TL;DR: 本文研究了腿式机器人在运动中测量地形特性的能力，比较了感知导向的爬行步态和运动导向的小跑步态。结果表明，爬行步态在检测脆性表面时更准确，而小跑步态测量结果的方差更大。这些发现为未来星球探测任务中的机器人步态设计提供了参考。


<details>

Motivation: 为了提升机器人在地质勘探中的操作能力，尤其是在松散、可变形基质上的移动，需要理解其环境的力学特性。研究表明，具有直接驱动和低齿轮比执行器的腿式机器人可以灵敏地检测外力，因此具备在运动中通过腿部测量地形特性的潜力。

Method: 本文通过比较感知导向的步态（Crawl N' Sense）和运动导向的步态（Trot-Walk），研究了步态对本体感知地形传感精度的影响。实验在实验室的刚性表面、松散沙地和带有合成表面结壳的松散沙地上进行，量化了每种步态测量可变形基质强度和纹理的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，两种步态均能一致区分低阻力和高阻力基质的强度（以穿透阻力衡量），但运动导向的小跑步态的测量结果幅度和方差更大。此外，爬行步态在检测表面脆性破裂时精度显著高于小跑步态。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，采用感知导向的爬行步态和运动导向的小跑步态，机器人能够测量不同阻力基质的强度差异。然而，运动导向的小跑步态在测量结果上表现出更大的幅度和方差。此外，较慢的爬行步态在检测表面脆性破裂时比快速的小跑步态更准确。这些结果为腿式机器人‘运动中感知’的步态设计和规划提供了新见解，有助于在其他星球上探测地形并进行科学测量。

Abstract: In-situ robotic exploration is an important tool for advancing knowledge of
geological processes that describe the Earth and other Planetary bodies. To
inform and enhance operations for these roving laboratories, it is imperative
to understand the terramechanical properties of their environments, especially
for traversing on loose, deformable substrates. Recent research suggested that
legged robots with direct-drive and low-gear ratio actuators can sensitively
detect external forces, and therefore possess the potential to measure terrain
properties with their legs during locomotion, providing unprecedented sampling
speed and density while accessing terrains previously too risky to sample. This
paper explores these ideas by investigating the impact of gait on
proprioceptive terrain sensing accuracy, particularly comparing a
sensing-oriented gait, Crawl N' Sense, with a locomotion-oriented gait,
Trot-Walk. Each gait's ability to measure the strength and texture of
deformable substrate is quantified as the robot locomotes over a laboratory
transect consisting of a rigid surface, loose sand, and loose sand with
synthetic surface crusts. Our results suggest that with both the
sensing-oriented crawling gait and locomotion-oriented trot gait, the robot can
measure a consistent difference in the strength (in terms of penetration
resistance) between the low- and high-resistance substrates; however, the
locomotion-oriented trot gait contains larger magnitude and variance in
measurements. Furthermore, the slower crawl gait can detect brittle ruptures of
the surface crusts with significantly higher accuracy than the faster trot
gait. Our results offer new insights that inform legged robot "sensing during
locomotion" gait design and planning for scouting the terrain and producing
scientific measurements on other worlds to advance our understanding of their
geology and formation.

Conclusion: ADP方法通过动态调整视觉令牌的保留比例，显著降低了计算成本并提升了推理速度，同时保持了较高的操作成功率。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation with Vision-Language-Action models requires efficient
inference over long-horizon multi-modal context, where attention to dense
visual tokens dominates computational cost. Existing methods optimize inference
speed by reducing visual redundancy within VLA models, but they overlook the
varying redundancy across robotic manipulation stages. We observe that the
visual token redundancy is higher in coarse manipulation phase than in
fine-grained operations, and is strongly correlated with the action dynamic.
Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{A}ction-aware
\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{ADP}), a multi-modal pruning
framework that integrates text-driven token selection with action-aware
trajectory gating. Our method introduces a gating mechanism that conditions the
pruning signal on recent action trajectories, using past motion windows to
adaptively adjust token retention ratios in accordance with dynamics, thereby
balancing computational efficiency and perceptual precision across different
manipulation stages. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO suites and diverse
real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FLOPs
and action inference latency (\textit{e.g.} $1.35 \times$ speed up on
OpenVLA-OFT) while maintaining competitive success rates (\textit{e.g.} 25.8\%
improvements with OpenVLA) compared to baselines, thereby providing a simple
plug-in path to efficient robot policies that advances the efficiency and
performance frontier of robotic manipulation. Our project website is:

Motivation: 由于人机系统中的不确定性，设计鲁棒控制器具有挑战性。线性化方法在实施鲁棒MPC时可能因机器人动力学的非线性而降低性能，因此需要一种更有效的控制策略。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种鲁棒非线性模型预测控制（RNMPC）方法，称为多阶段NMPC，用于控制两自由度外骨骼机器人。该方法通过解决非线性优化问题，显著提高了系统的鲁棒性，降低了跟踪误差和交互力。

Abstract: The use of exoskeleton robots is increasing due to the rising number of
musculoskeletal injuries. However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the
design of control systems. Designing robust controllers is challenging because
of uncertainties in human-robot systems. Among various control strategies,
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful approach due to its ability to
handle constraints and optimize performance. Previous studies have used
linearization-based methods to implement robust MPC on exoskeletons, but these
can degrade performance due to nonlinearities in the robot's dynamics. To
address this gap, this paper proposes a Robust Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (RNMPC) method, called multi-stage NMPC, to control a
two-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton by solving a nonlinear optimization problem.
This method uses multiple scenarios to represent system uncertainties. The
study focuses on minimizing human-robot interaction forces during the swing
phase, particularly when the robot carries unknown loads. Simulations and
experimental tests show that the proposed method significantly improves
robustness, outperforming non-robust NMPC. It achieves lower tracking errors
and interaction forces under various uncertainties. For instance, when a 2 kg
unknown payload is combined with external disturbances, the RMS values of thigh
and shank interaction forces for multi-stage NMPC are reduced by 77 and 94
percent, respectively, compared to non-robust NMPC.

Abstract: Universal grasping with multi-fingered dexterous hands is a fundamental
challenge in robotic manipulation. While recent approaches successfully learn
closed-loop grasping policies using reinforcement learning (RL), the inherent
difficulty of high-dimensional, long-horizon exploration necessitates complex
reward and curriculum design, often resulting in suboptimal solutions across
diverse objects. We propose DemoGrasp, a simple yet effective method for
learning universal dexterous grasping. We start from a single successful
demonstration trajectory of grasping a specific object and adapt to novel
objects and poses by editing the robot actions in this trajectory: changing the
wrist pose determines where to grasp, and changing the hand joint angles
determines how to grasp. We formulate this trajectory editing as a single-step
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use RL to optimize a universal policy across
hundreds of objects in parallel in simulation, with a simple reward consisting
of a binary success term and a robot-table collision penalty. In simulation,
DemoGrasp achieves a 95% success rate on DexGraspNet objects using the Shadow
Hand, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. It also shows strong
transferability, achieving an average success rate of 84.6% across diverse
dexterous hand embodiments on six unseen object datasets, while being trained
on only 175 objects. Through vision-based imitation learning, our policy
successfully grasps 110 unseen real-world objects, including small, thin items.
It generalizes to spatial, background, and lighting changes, supports both RGB
and depth inputs, and extends to language-guided grasping in cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Learning to generate dual-hand grasps that respect object semantics is
essential for robust hand-object interaction but remains largely underexplored
due to dataset scarcity. Existing grasp datasets predominantly focus on
single-hand interactions and contain only limited semantic part annotations. To
address these challenges, we introduce a pipeline, SymOpt, that constructs a
large-scale dual-hand grasp dataset by leveraging existing single-hand datasets
and exploiting object and hand symmetries. Building on this, we propose a
text-guided dual-hand grasp generator, DHAGrasp, that synthesizes Dual-Hand
Affordance-aware Grasps for unseen objects. Our approach incorporates a novel
dual-hand affordance representation and follows a two-stage design, which
enables effective learning from a small set of segmented training objects while
scaling to a much larger pool of unsegmented data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method produces diverse and semantically consistent
grasps, outperforming strong baselines in both grasp quality and generalization
to unseen objects. The project page is at

Conclusion: VLM2VLA通过自然语言表示低级动作，解决了数据分布不匹配问题，采用LoRA微调方法避免了灾难性遗忘，保持了VLM的核心能力，实现了零样本泛化。

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to
create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training
generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to
produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and
multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios,
instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this
catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's
internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired
by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first
resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with
natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and
averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on
robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying
architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets.
Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800
real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the
VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that
require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.

Conclusion: VLA模型通过MimicDreamer框架，利用人类演示视频生成机器人可用的监督数据，显著提升了在真实机器人上的少样本执行能力，且性能优于仅使用真实机器人数据训练的模型。

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability
from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data
remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are
far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm
their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap
persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable
camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms,
and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose
MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into
robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to
directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner,
a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos
by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint
stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos
via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For
action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a
constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint
commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on
our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real
robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts
performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach
improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Generalizing to long-horizon manipulation tasks in a zero-shot setting
remains a central challenge in robotics. Current multimodal foundation based
approaches, despite their capabilities, typically fail to decompose high-level
commands into executable action sequences from static visual input alone. To
address this challenge, we introduce Super-Mimic, a hierarchical framework that
enables zero-shot robotic imitation by directly inferring procedural intent
from unscripted human demonstration videos. Our framework is composed of two
sequential modules. First, a Human Intent Translator (HIT) parses the input
video using multimodal reasoning to produce a sequence of language-grounded
subtasks. These subtasks then condition a Future Dynamics Predictor (FDP),
which employs a generative model that synthesizes a physically plausible video
rollout for each step. The resulting visual trajectories are dynamics-aware,
explicitly modeling crucial object interactions and contact points to guide the
low-level controller. We validate this approach through extensive experiments
on a suite of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where Super-Mimic significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by over 20\%. These results
establish that coupling video-driven intent parsing with prospective dynamics
modeling is a highly effective strategy for developing general-purpose robotic
systems.

Abstract: Preschool children with language vulnerabilities -- such as developmental
language disorders or immigration related language challenges -- often require
support to strengthen their expressive language skills. Based on the principle
of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target
morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or
game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the
same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time
production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he
drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent
also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based
activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an
application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval
game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application
currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue,
affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the
capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological
targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at
this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately
serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using
LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for
children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a
robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of
teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.

*Johan Hatleskog,Morten Nissov,Kostas Alexis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 新方法通过IMU预积分雷达因子减少节点数量，显著降低计算成本，优化时间最多减少56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定滞后雷达-LiDAR-惯性平滑器因缺乏时间同步而创建过多节点，导致计算成本高，难以在资源受限硬件上实时运行。

Method: 提出IMU预积分雷达因子，利用高频率惯性数据将最新LiDAR状态传播到雷达测量时间戳，从而减少因子图节点数量。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在单板计算机上保持基线绝对姿态误差的同时，优化时间最多减少56%。

Conclusion: 引入IMU预积分雷达因子后，在保持绝对姿态误差不变的同时，显著降低了计算成本，优化时间最多减少56%。

Abstract: Fixed-lag Radar-LiDAR-Inertial smoothers conventionally create one factor
graph node per measurement to compensate for the lack of time synchronization
between radar and LiDAR. For a radar-LiDAR sensor pair with equal rates, this
strategy results in a state creation rate of twice the individual sensor
frequencies. This doubling of the number of states per second yields high
optimization costs, inhibiting real-time performance on resource-constrained
hardware. We introduce IMU-preintegrated radar factors that use high-rate
inertial data to propagate the most recent LiDAR state to the radar measurement
timestamp. This strategy maintains the node creation rate at the LiDAR
measurement frequency. Assuming equal sensor rates, this lowers the number of
nodes by 50 % and consequently the computational costs. Experiments on a single
board computer (which has 4 cores each of 2.2 GHz A73 and 2 GHz A53 with 8 GB
RAM) show that our method preserves the absolute pose error of a conventional
baseline while simultaneously lowering the aggregated factor graph optimization
time by up to 56 %.

Abstract: Hospital patient falls remain a critical and costly challenge worldwide.
While conventional fall prevention systems typically rely on post-fall
detection or reactive alerts, they also often suffer from high false positive
rates and fail to address the underlying patient needs that lead to bed-exit
attempts. This paper presents a novel system architecture that leverages the
Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) to orchestrate human-robot-robot interaction
for proactive and personalized patient assistance. The system integrates a
privacy-preserving thermal sensing model capable of real-time bed-exit
prediction, with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based
on predicted intent and patient input. This orchestrated response could not
only reduce fall risk but also attend to the patient's underlying motivations
for movement, such as thirst, discomfort, or the need for assistance, before a
hazardous situation arises. Our contributions with this pilot study are
three-fold: (1) a modular IoRT-based framework enabling distributed sensing,
prediction, and multi-robot coordination; (2) a demonstration of low-resolution
thermal sensing for accurate, privacy-preserving preemptive bed-exit detection;
and (3) results from a user study and systematic error analysis that inform the
design of situationally aware, multi-agent interactions in hospital settings.
The findings highlight how interactive and connected robotic systems can move
beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, empowering
safer, more responsive care environments.

TL;DR: 提出了首个系统量化机器人操作中视觉偏差的基准RoboView-Bias，发现智能体存在显著视觉偏差，并提出有效缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注泛化性和扰动下的鲁棒性，缺乏对视觉偏差的系统量化，限制了理解感知如何影响决策稳定性。

Method: 提出了RoboView-Bias基准，通过因素隔离原则，利用结构化变体生成框架和感知公平验证协议，创建了2,127个任务实例。

Result: 评估了三种具身智能体，发现所有智能体均存在显著视觉偏差，其中相机视角是最关键因素；基于语义接地层的缓解策略可将视觉偏差减少约54.5%。

Conclusion: 系统性的视觉偏差分析是开发安全可靠通用具身智能体的前提。

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased
visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization
and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual
bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception
influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose
RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically
quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor
isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a
perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that
enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and
their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three
representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three
key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera
viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest
success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual
preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,
asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.
Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic
grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on
MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a
prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于触觉反应的多代理MPC方法，用于抓取不同软度和形状的物体，显著提升了多代理系统的协作抓取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抓取实现主要针对刚性物品，对脆弱或可变形材料的处理性能较差，且单代理系统无法抓取和操纵大型、重型物体。

Method: 提出了一个基于学习的触觉反应多代理模型预测控制器（MPC），利用两个Gelsight Mini触觉传感器实时提取物体纹理和刚度信息，通过触觉编码预测抓取稳定性并调整力和位置。

Result: 该方法在实现和维持对不同大小和刚度物体的稳定抓取方面，成功率和性能均优于独立的PD和MPC基线。

Conclusion: 通过结合触觉感知和学习型多代理MPC，该方法为复杂环境中的协作抓取提供了鲁棒、智能的解决方案，显著提升了多代理系统的能力。

Abstract: Grasping is a core task in robotics with various applications. However, most
current implementations are primarily designed for rigid items, and their
performance drops considerably when handling fragile or deformable materials
that require real-time feedback. Meanwhile, tactile-reactive grasping focuses
on a single agent, which limits their ability to grasp and manipulate large,
heavy objects. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based, tactile-reactive
multi-agent Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for grasping a wide range of
objects with different softness and shapes, beyond the capabilities of
preexisting single-agent implementations. Our system uses two Gelsight Mini
tactile sensors [1] to extract real-time information on object texture and
stiffness. This rich tactile feedback is used to estimate contact dynamics and
object compliance in real time, enabling the system to adapt its control policy
to diverse object geometries and stiffness profiles. The learned controller
operates in a closed loop, leveraging tactile encoding to predict grasp
stability and adjust force and position accordingly. Our key technical
contributions include a multi-agent MPC formulation trained on real contact
interactions, a tactile-data driven method for inferring grasping states, and a
coordination strategy that enables collaborative control. By combining tactile
sensing and a learning-based multi-agent MPC, our method offers a robust,
intelligent solution for collaborative grasping in complex environments,
significantly advancing the capabilities of multi-agent systems. Our approach
is validated through extensive experiments against independent PD and MPC
baselines. Our pipeline outperforms the baselines regarding success rates in
achieving and maintaining stable grasps across objects of varying sizes and
stiffness.

Conclusion: 论文提出了OntoBOT本体，通过统一任务、动作、环境和能力的表示，支持服务机器人中的上下文感知推理、任务导向执行和知识共享，并通过四种机器人验证了其通用性。

Abstract: Personal service robots are increasingly used in domestic settings to assist
older adults and people requiring support. Effective operation involves not
only physical interaction but also the ability to interpret dynamic
environments, understand tasks, and choose appropriate actions based on
context. This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors,
actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments,
and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS)
provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with
higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly
coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and
hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing.
Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks,
environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the
Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for
Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities,
spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on
specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment,
action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we
propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing
ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments,
and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects
into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and
(2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions
across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how
OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge
sharing in service robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下操作因流体动力学干扰、有限的通信带宽和浑浊水域中的感知退化而困难重重，需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 1. 双脑架构将高级任务推理与低级反应控制解耦；2. 首次将视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型应用于水下机器人；3. 采用流体力学感知的模型预测控制（MPC）方案实时补偿流体效应。

Conclusion: UnderwaterVLA通过减少对水下特定训练数据的依赖并提高跨环境适应性，为下一代智能AUV提供了一种可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents UnderwaterVLA, a novel framework for autonomous
underwater navigation that integrates multimodal foundation models with
embodied intelligence systems. Underwater operations remain difficult due to
hydrodynamic disturbances, limited communication bandwidth, and degraded
sensing in turbid waters. To address these challenges, we introduce three
innovations. First, a dual-brain architecture decouples high-level mission
reasoning from low-level reactive control, enabling robust operation under
communication and computational constraints. Second, we apply
Vision-Language-Action(VLA) models to underwater robotics for the first time,
incorporating structured chain-of-thought reasoning for interpretable
decision-making. Third, a hydrodynamics-informed Model Predictive Control(MPC)
scheme compensates for fluid effects in real time without costly task-specific
training. Experimental results in field tests show that UnderwaterVLA reduces
navigation errors in degraded visual conditions while maintaining higher task
completion by 19% to 27% over baseline. By minimizing reliance on
underwater-specific training data and improving adaptability across
environments, UnderwaterVLA provides a scalable and cost-effective path toward
the next generation of intelligent AUVs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a task allocation algorithm for teams of heterogeneous
robots in environments with uncertain task requirements. We model these
requirements as probability distributions over capabilities and use this model
to allocate tasks such that robots with complementary skills naturally position
near uncertain tasks, proactively mitigating task failures without wasting
resources. We introduce a market-based approach that optimizes the joint team
objective while explicitly capturing coupled rewards between robots, offering a
polynomial-time solution in decentralized settings with strict communication
assumptions. Comparative experiments against benchmark algorithms demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the challenges of incorporating
coupled rewards in a decentralized formulation.

Abstract: Mutual understanding of artificial agents' decisions is key to ensuring a
trustworthy and successful human-robot interaction. Hence, robots are expected
to make reasonable decisions and communicate them to humans when needed. In
this article, the focus is on an approach to modeling and reasoning about the
comparison of two competing plans, so that robots can later explain the
divergent result. First, a novel ontological model is proposed to formalize and
reason about the differences between competing plans, enabling the
classification of the most appropriate one (e.g., the shortest, the safest, the
closest to human preferences, etc.). This work also investigates the
limitations of a baseline algorithm for ontology-based explanatory narration.
To address these limitations, a novel algorithm is presented, leveraging
divergent knowledge between plans and facilitating the construction of
contrastive narratives. Through empirical evaluation, it is observed that the
explanations excel beyond the baseline method.

Result: HELIOS在Habitat模拟器的OVMM基准测试中表现优异，能够处理复杂场景中的小目标物体感知挑战。

Conclusion: HELIOS在OVMM基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，并且能够零样本迁移到现实世界，如在Spot机器人上的办公室环境中展示的那样。

Abstract: Language-specified mobile manipulation tasks in novel environments
simultaneously face challenges interacting with a scene which is only partially
observed, grounding semantic information from language instructions to the
partially observed scene, and actively updating knowledge of the scene with new
observations. To address these challenges, we propose HELIOS, a hierarchical
scene representation and associated search objective to perform language
specified pick and place mobile manipulation tasks. We construct 2D maps
containing the relevant semantic and occupancy information for navigation while
simultaneously actively constructing 3D Gaussian representations of
task-relevant objects. We fuse observations across this multi-layered
representation while explicitly modeling the multi-view consistency of the
detections of each object. In order to efficiently search for the target
object, we formulate an objective function balancing exploration of unobserved
or uncertain regions with exploitation of scene semantic information. We
evaluate HELIOS on the OVMM benchmark in the Habitat simulator, a pick and
place benchmark in which perception is challenging due to large and complex
scenes with comparatively small target objects. HELIOS achieves
state-of-the-art results on OVMM. As our approach is zero-shot, HELIOS can also
transfer to the real world without requiring additional data, as we illustrate
by demonstrating it in a real world office environment on a Spot robot.

Motivation: 混合交通环境中，自动驾驶车辆与多样化人类驾驶车辆的交互存在不可预测的意图和异质行为，使得安全高效的车道变换极具挑战性。现有方法往往假设统一模式，过于简化这些交互。

Method: 提出了一种意图驱动的车道变换框架，包括驾驶风格识别、合作感知决策和协调运动规划。使用深度学习分类器实时识别人类驾驶风格，合作评分估计周围驾驶员的意图并量化其合作意愿。决策结合行为克隆和逆强化学习，轨迹生成则整合模型预测控制和基于IRL的意图推断。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在车道变换识别中达到94.2%准确率和94.3% F1分数，优于基于规则和学习的基线方法4-15%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过建模驾驶员异质性，展示了在复杂交通环境中推进情境感知和类人自动驾驶的潜力。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with
diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous
behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging.
Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform
patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates
driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated
motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset
identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with
intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions
and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle.
Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning
to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory
generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention
inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers.
Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\%
F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in
lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling
inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to
advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is
crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the
past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most
existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with
depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive
or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for
predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster
robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent
prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which
can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we
introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new
loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on
out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:
0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB
input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future
research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human
interaction intent.

Conclusion: EgoDemoGen 提供了一种实用的方法，使机器人操作在自我中心视角下更加稳健。

Abstract: Imitation learning based policies perform well in robotic manipulation, but
they often degrade under *egocentric viewpoint shifts* when trained from a
single egocentric viewpoint. To address this issue, we present **EgoDemoGen**,
a framework that generates *paired* novel egocentric demonstrations by
retargeting actions in the novel egocentric frame and synthesizing the
corresponding egocentric observation videos with proposed generative video
repair model **EgoViewTransfer**, which is conditioned by a novel-viewpoint
reprojected scene video and a robot-only video rendered from the retargeted
joint actions. EgoViewTransfer is finetuned from a pretrained video generation
model using self-supervised double reprojection strategy. We evaluate
EgoDemoGen on both simulation (RoboTwin2.0) and real-world robot. After
training with a mixture of EgoDemoGen-generated novel egocentric demonstrations
and original standard egocentric demonstrations, policy success rate improves
**absolutely** by **+17.0%** for standard egocentric viewpoint and by
**+17.7%** for novel egocentric viewpoints in simulation. On real-world robot,
the **absolute** improvements are **+18.3%** and **+25.8%**. Moreover,
performance continues to improve as the proportion of EgoDemoGen-generated
demonstrations increases, with diminishing returns. These results demonstrate
that EgoDemoGen provides a practical route to egocentric viewpoint-robust
robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过主动互动理解直观物理，而当前视频模型（如Sora）依赖被动观察，难以掌握物理因果关系。假设真实物理直觉需基于大量因果丰富的真实世界交互。

Method: 提出WoW，一个基于200万机器人交互轨迹训练的140亿参数生成世界模型，并引入SOPHIA和逆向动力学模型来约束和实现物理真实性。

Result: WoW在WoWBench基准测试中表现最佳，展现出物理因果性、碰撞动力学和物体持久性的强大能力。

Conclusion: 大规模真实世界交互是AI发展物理直觉的基石。WoW模型、数据和基准测试将开源。

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active
interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video
models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle
with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central
hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in
extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this
hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model
trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that
the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of
plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical
hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can
be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where
vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its
refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a
co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into
executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We
establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal
reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) achieve strong performance in general
robotic manipulation tasks by scaling imitation learning. However, existing
VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with
long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this
problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively
empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via
test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible
action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future
states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason
potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action
spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a
confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to
enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate
intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score
predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted
extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that
our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward
scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: DAWN框架通过结合扩散建模和运动中心表示，为可扩展和鲁棒的机器人学习提供了强大基线，展示了在仿真和现实世界中的高效迁移能力。

Abstract: We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unified
diffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that
bridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structured
pixel motion representation. In DAWN, both the high-level and low-level
controllers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable,
end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN
achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark,
demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its
effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between
simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable
real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical
viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our
results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with
motion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robust
robot learning. Project page: https://nero1342.github.io/DAWN/

TL;DR: SPF是一种无需训练的无人机导航框架，通过2D空间定位任务实现高效导航，性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于VLM的方法将动作预测视为文本生成任务，而SPF的创新在于将其视为2D空间定位任务，以提高导航效率和准确性。

Method: SPF利用VLMs将模糊语言指令分解为输入图像上的2D路径点迭代标注，并结合预测的移动距离，将其转换为3D位移向量作为无人机的动作指令。

Result: SPF在DRL仿真基准测试中表现优异，比之前的最佳方法高出63%，并在实际评估中大幅超越基线方法。

Conclusion: SPF是一种无需训练的空视语言导航框架，基于视觉语言模型（VLMs），通过将动作预测视为2D空间定位任务，显著提升了导航性能，并在仿真和实际环境中均表现出色。

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev
