### [1] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO利用视频一致性模型（VCMs）实现高效高质的视频恢复，解决了逐帧应用图像LDMs导致的时间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于图像潜在扩散模型（LDMs）的视频恢复方法在逐帧应用时导致的时间不一致性问题。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型（VCMs）捕捉时间因果关系，提出LVTINO作为视频恢复的逆求解器，绕过自动微分的需求，仅需少量神经功能评估。

Result: 在多种视频逆问题上，LVTINO在重建保真度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LVTINO基于视频一致性模型（VCMs）提出了一种零样本或即插即用的高清晰度视频恢复方法，显著提升了重建质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出三阶段训练方法，通过风格编码器和投影层实现细粒度文本引导的风格化图像生成，并构建Style30k-captions数据集支持实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型中细粒度风格难以精确描述和控制的问题，以及风格参考图像的引导信息难以与传统文本条件直接对齐的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于三阶段训练的风格提取图像生成方法，使用风格编码器和风格投影层将风格表示与文本表示对齐。

Result: 实现了细粒度控制的风格化图像生成，并通过Style30k-captions数据集验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过风格编码器和风格投影层实现了细粒度文本引导的风格化图像生成，同时构建了Style30k-captions数据集以支持实验。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究收集了一个困难演变数据集，通过时间动作定位模型检测学习中的困难，结果表明困难是可迁移的，但检测仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解学习过程中困难的演变对于优化人类学习和开发有效的辅助系统至关重要，但现有数据集未关注困难的演变。

Method: 本研究通过收集一个包含61.68小时视频、2,793个视频和5,385个标注时间困难片段的数据集，定义了困难确定问题为时间动作定位任务，并利用时间动作定位模型进行实验。

Result: 模型在跨任务和跨活动中的平均mAP分别为34.56%和19.24%，表明困难是一个可迁移的概念。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，时间动作定位模型能够成功检测到学习中的困难信号，即使在未见过的任务或活动中也表现良好。模型在跨任务和跨活动中的平均mAP分别为34.56%和19.24%，表明困难是一个可迁移的概念，但仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

### [4] [SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370)
*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS是一种基于残差U-Net的轻量级PDE求解基础模型，通过自回归预训练策略在多种PDE任务中实现高效泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型通常基于复杂的大型Transformer架构，计算和参数开销高，而SPUS旨在探索轻量级U-Net架构在此领域的潜力。

Method: 利用轻量级残差U-Net架构和自回归预训练策略，模拟数值求解器的行为以学习底层物理规律。

Result: SPUS在6种未见过的下游PDE任务中实现了最先进的泛化性能，同时所需的参数和微调数据显著减少。

Conclusion: SPUS作为一种基于残差U-Net的紧凑型基础模型，在解决多种PDE系统时表现出卓越的泛化能力和参数效率。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo 是一种基于强化学习的框架，通过优化身份多样性解决了多人生成中的问题，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在多人生成中存在身份重复、融合和计数错误的问题，需要一种无需额外标注的解决方案。

Method: DisCo 采用 Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) 和组合奖励机制，优化面部多样性、身份重复、人数准确性和视觉保真度。

Result: 在 DiverseHumans 测试集上，DisCo 实现了 98.6% 的独特面部准确率和近乎完美的全局身份分布，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo 通过强化学习框架有效解决了多人生成中的身份多样性问题，为生成模型设定了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种层次化地理嵌入和视觉特征融合的方法，显著提升了视觉地理定位的准确性，在多个基准数据集上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球视觉地理定位是一个重要的研究课题，但现有的地理表示方法仍有改进空间。论文旨在通过学习更有效的地理和视觉表示来提升定位性能。

Method: 论文提出了一种层次化的地理嵌入表示方法，并引入了一种有效的方法，将查询图像的外观特征与其语义分割图融合，形成鲁棒的视觉表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在五个基准数据集上的25个指标中，有22个指标达到了历史最佳性能，优于现有技术和大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新颖的地理表示方法，通过将查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示对齐，显著提升了视觉地理定位的性能。实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准数据集上优于现有技术。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XMAS通过聚类相似跨模态注意力矩阵的示例，有效减少LVLM训练数据冗余，保持性能并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在LVLM数据选择中表现不佳，无法超越随机选择。研究旨在填补这一空白，提出首个数据高效的LVLM指令调优方法。

Method: 提出XMAS方法，基于代理LVLM微调过程中注意力矩阵的顶部奇异值轨迹对示例进行聚类，并从这些聚类中采样平衡子集。

Result: XMAS能够丢弃50%的LLaVA-665k数据集和85%的Vision-Flan数据集，完全保留LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游基准上的性能，并加速训练1.2倍。

Conclusion: XMAS方法通过聚类相似跨模态注意力矩阵的示例，有效去除了大规模LVLM训练数据中的冗余，在保持模型性能的同时显著减少了训练数据量和时间。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception是一种用于向量量化图像生成的变分流匹配方法，结合连续和离散监督，提高训练效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合连续方法的几何感知和类别方法的离散监督，以实现对可信代码的不确定性量化和温度控制生成。

Method: 通过在学习代码书索引的类别后验的同时，在连续嵌入空间中计算速度场，将Variational Flow Matching适应于向量量化潜在空间。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务中，训练收敛速度优于连续和离散流匹配基线，同时达到与最先进模型竞争的FID分数。

Conclusion: Variational Flow Matching可以有效结合连续传输和离散监督，提高图像生成的训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出统一深度学习框架，结合CDM和多任务学习，直接从NCCT生成合成CECT并分割主动脉，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多阶段方法在生成合成CECT图像和分割任务中易导致误差累积，且无法充分利用共享的语义和解剖结构。

Method: 采用条件扩散模型（CDM）与多任务学习结合的统一框架，实现了从NCCT扫描生成合成CECT图像并同时分割主动脉腔和血栓的端到端联合优化。

Result: 在264名患者的数据集上，模型在图像合成（PSNR 25.61 dB）和分割任务（腔Dice分数0.89，血栓0.53）上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一深度学习框架通过结合条件扩散模型和多任务学习，显著提升了合成CECT图像的质量和主动脉分割的准确性，减少了临床测量误差。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

### [10] [From Videos to Indexed Knowledge Graphs -- Framework to Marry Methods for Multimodal Content Analysis and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01513)
*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一个框架，结合预训练模型将视频转换为可查询的知识图谱，支持持续学习，简化多模态内容分析流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容分析复杂且计算成本高，现有预训练模型在静态数据上表现良好，但与复杂数据（如视频）的融合仍具挑战性。

Method: 框架结合了预训练模型，将视频转换为时间半结构化数据格式，并进一步转化为帧级索引知识图谱表示。

Result: 开发了一个支持持续学习和动态知识整合的框架，能够高效原型化多模态内容分析流程。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个框架，能够高效地原型化多模态内容分析的流程，通过结合预训练模型将视频转换为时间半结构化数据格式，并进一步转化为可查询的帧级索引知识图谱表示，支持持续学习和动态整合新领域知识。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

TL;DR: WALT通过逆向工程网站功能为工具，简化了网页代理的自动化过程，减少了依赖逐步操作和大量LLM推理的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于逐步UI交互和大量LLM推理的网页代理方法在动态布局和长时任务中表现脆弱，而人类则通过高级操作（如搜索、过滤、排序）更高效地利用网站功能。

Method: WALT 框架将网站功能逆向工程为可重用的工具，如搜索、过滤、排序等，抽象了底层执行细节。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena上，WALT以更少的步骤和更少的LLM依赖推理实现了更高的成功率。

Conclusion: WALT 通过将网站功能逆向工程为可调用的工具，减少了依赖逐步UI交互和大量LLM推理的脆弱性，为浏览器自动化提供了一种更稳健、可推广的范例。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种半监督分割框架，通过拓扑一致性机制和新型匹配策略，有效减少了拓扑错误，提高了分割的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

TL;DR: Diffusion-LPO 利用列表偏好优化扩散模型，显著提升生成质量和偏好对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类对图像的偏好反馈通常包含隐含的排名信息，比成对比较更能精确反映偏好，但现有方法主要依赖成对偏好。

Method: 通过 Plackett-Luce 模型扩展 DPO 目标，利用排名数据优化扩散模型，确保样本在整个排名中的一致性。

Result: Diffusion-LPO 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中表现优异，视觉质量和偏好对齐均优于成对 DPO 基线。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO 是一种简单有效的框架，用于在扩散模型中优化列表偏好，显著优于基于成对偏好的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建统一的MLLM模型面临挑战：混合方法破坏了自回归范式，而纯自回归方法在语义对齐和像素级保真度之间存在权衡。

Method: 采用Mixture-of-Transformers架构和语义到像素的离散表示方法，结合紧凑的语义令牌和细粒度的像素令牌，以较短的序列长度实现了强语言对齐和视觉细节的精确描述。

Result: Bridge在多种多模态基准测试中表现出色，在理解和生成任务上均取得竞争性或更优的结果，同时减少了训练数据和训练时间。

Conclusion: Bridge，一种纯自回归的统一多模态大语言模型（MLLM），通过Mixture-of-Transformers架构增强了预训练视觉理解模型的生成能力，实现了在单一的下一个令牌预测框架内同时进行图像理解和生成。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于耳部静脉模式的非侵入性猪只识别方法，使用计算机视觉和机器学习，在混合品种中达到98.12%准确率，适合实时农场部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的猪只识别方法（如耳标和微芯片）通常不可靠、成本高且仅适用于纯种猪，对小规模农户不实用。因此，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究开发了一个多阶段的计算机视觉流程，包括增强静脉可见性、提取结构和空间特征、生成生物识别签名，并使用机器学习模型（如支持向量机）进行分类。

Result: 支持向量机（SVM）在混合品种猪群中实现了98.12%的准确率，从图像处理到分类的平均时间为8.3秒，证明了实时农场部署的可行性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过利用耳部静脉模式的独特性，提出了一种非侵入性的猪只生物识别方法，支持实时农场部署，为资源有限的农业社区提供了成本效益高且无压力的动物识别解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

TL;DR: 提出CNN+贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，通过不确定性量化提升小数据集下的口腔癌分类可靠性，在多样化数据中泛化性能优于传统CNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔癌在全球范围内发病率高且死亡率高，尤其在医疗资源匮乏地区。早期诊断面临医疗资源不足、数据稀缺等挑战，传统深度学习模型因依赖大数据和点估计而可靠性不足。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络（CNN）与贝叶斯深度学习相结合的混合模型，利用变分推断进行不确定性量化，使用智能手机拍摄的彩色图像进行训练和测试。

Result: 模型在训练数据分布相似的测试集上达到94%准确率，与传统CNN相当；在现实世界多样化数据集上表现更优，准确率达88%（传统CNN为72.94%），且能 negativesamples。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的结合卷积神经网络（CNN）与贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，在数据稀缺环境下显著提高了口腔癌分类的可靠性和泛化能力，为早期诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

TL;DR: CADTrans通过辅助领域模块和多重一致性策略，解决了SFDA中不变特征获取和硬样本对齐的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法因无法直接访问源域数据，难以获得确定的不变特征，且易受硬样本和领域偏差影响。

Method: 提出CADTrans框架，包括辅助领域模块、多重一致性策略和CMK-MMD对齐策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如Office-31、Office-Home等）上验证了CADTrans的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: CADTrans通过构建领域一致性的不变特征表示，显著提升了SFDA的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的MLLM应用通常提供冗长且不区分上下文的描述，导致BLV用户需要筛选大量无关信息，效率低下。

Method: 系统从VizWiz-LF数据集中识别相似的历史视觉上下文，并利用相关的问题指导MLLM生成更符合BLV用户需求的描述。

Result: 评估显示，上下文感知的描述在76.1%的情况下能预测并回答用户的问题，且在54.4%的比较中被用户偏好。

Conclusion: 研究开发了一个系统，通过利用历史BLV用户的问题来生成更符合上下文的描述，显著提高了描述的相关性和用户偏好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

Conclusion: NPN提出了一种新的正则化方法，通过关注感知矩阵的零空间结构，设计特定于感知矩阵的先验，从而在多种成像逆问题中显著提高了重建质量。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过整合RLVR和GRPO，显著提升了VLA模型的推理和执行能力，并在多领域评估中展现出卓越的泛化性能和实际应用效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this

Result: 实验表明，该方法能从少量多视角图像中实现高质量图像去模糊和高保真3D外观恢复。

Conclusion: 提出的联合去模糊和3D重建方法在宏观摄影中实现了高质量的图像去模糊和高保真3D外观恢复。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在青铜器铭文识别任务中显著优于现有技术，为后续考古分析奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的UDA方法对每个新的源-目标对都需要微调骨干网络参数，导致训练参数和存储需求线性增长，且无法重用已训练好的骨干网络参数。

Method: VirDA在现有骨干网络前添加一个域特定的视觉重编程层，生成视觉提示作为输入图像的纹理偏置，优化多个目标函数来调整域内和域间分布差异。

Result: 在Office-31数据集上，VirDA实现了92.8%的平均准确率，仅需1.5M可训练参数，优于PDA等现有方法。

Conclusion: VirDA通过视觉重编程层实现了高效的跨域适应，显著减少了可训练参数数量，同时在准确性上优于或接近现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Motivation: 现有的面部表情编码系统（如 FACS）存在覆盖范围有限和手动标注成本高的问题，需要一种更高效、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 使用 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) 提取身份不变的表情特征，并通过 Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE) 编码这些特征，生成共享码本中的离散标记序列。

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

TL;DR: Con-NRSfM是一种新颖的NRSfM方法，通过图优化和自监督学习实现高精度的3D重建，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从多视角不一致图像中鲁棒重建3D场景的挑战，现有方法依赖密集观测且优化过程复杂。

Method: 提出UniVerse，一个基于视频扩散模型的统一框架，首先将不一致图像转换为初始视频，然后使用专门设计的视频扩散模型恢复为一致图像，最后从这些恢复图像中重建3D场景。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，UniVerse具有强泛化能力和优越性能。

Conclusion: UniVerse框架通过将鲁棒重建分解为恢复和重建两个子任务，简化了优化过程，并展示了在多样图像不一致情况下的强泛化能力和优越性能。此外，UniVerse还能控制重建3D场景的风格。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模板匹配方法效率低下，而基于深度学习的方法缺乏对几何姿态的显式建模，无法满足实际部署需求。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级端到端框架，通过联合定位和几何回归解决模板匹配问题，并引入了模板感知动态卷积模块（TDCM）和旋转-剪切增强策略。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在复合变换下实现了高精度和14ms的推理速度，并在小模板和多对象场景中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的轻量级端到端框架在工业应用中表现出高精度和高效性，适合实时部署。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应像素推理框架，通过动态调整像素级操作的使用，显著提升了视觉语言模型在细粒度任务中的性能，同时减少了不必要的视觉操作，实验证明了其高效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理需要精确理解细粒度视觉元素的任务时表现不佳，主要由于图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域关注不足。虽然近期工作通过引入像素级视觉信息改善了性能，但过度使用这类信息会导致效率低下和无关视觉细节的干扰。

Method: 论文首先通过操作感知的监督微调建立文本推理和视觉操作的基础能力，然后设计了一个基于模型自身反馈的rollout-guided强化学习框架，使视觉语言模型能够根据查询难度动态决定何时调用像素操作。

Result: 在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中，模型表现出卓越性能，同时显著减少了不必要的视觉操作。在HR-Bench 4K上实现了73.4%的准确率，工具使用率仅为20.1%，相比之前方法在准确率和工具使用率上分别提升了性能和降低了66.5%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的自适应像素推理框架通过动态决定必要的像素级操作，显著提升了视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉任务中的性能，同时减少了不必要的视觉操作。模型在HR-Bench 4K上达到了73.4%的准确率，工具使用率仅为20.1%，相比之前的方法在准确率和效率上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

TL;DR: ASRS框架通过测量图像增强后的嵌入变化，识别易出错的CXR病例，提高医疗AI的公平性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光片（CXR）解释中表现优异，但在公平性和可靠性方面存在问题。模型在不同患者亚组中表现不均，导致隐藏的失败未被聚合指标反映。现有错误检测方法难以处理细微的分布内错误。

Method: 提出了增强敏感性风险评分（ASRS）框架，通过应用临床合理的旋转（±15°/±30°）并使用RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入变化。敏感性评分将样本分为稳定性四分位数。

Result: 高度敏感的病例显示出显著较低的召回率（-0.2至-0.3），尽管AUROC和置信度较高。ASRS能够有效识别易出错的CXR病例。

Conclusion: ASRS框架提供了一种无需标签的方法，用于选择性预测和临床医生审查，从而提高了医疗AI的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

Motivation: 现有视频风格化方法存在时间一致性差、风格丰富度低或需要昂贵计算资源的问题，FreeViS 旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过整合多个风格化参考到预训练的 I2V 模型中，结合高频补偿和基于流的运动线索来保持内容布局、运动及风格纹理。

Conclusion: FreeViS 提供了一种无需训练的高质量视频风格化解决方案，具有高保真度和优秀的时间一致性，优于现有基线方法并获得了人类的强烈偏好。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

TL;DR: MedQ-Bench是一个基于多模态大语言模型的医学图像质量评估基准，通过感知和推理任务评估模型能力，结果显示现有模型的性能尚不足以可靠支持临床应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学IQA方法受限于基于标量分数的指标，无法体现专家评估中描述性、类人的推理过程。因此，需要一种更贴近人类推理的语言化评估方法。

Method: 研究团队提出了MedQ-Bench，一个包含两个任务的综合基准：MedQ-Perception（通过人工策划的问题评估低级感知能力）和MedQ-Reasoning（涵盖无参考和比较推理任务）。该基准覆盖五种成像模态和四十多种质量属性，总计2,600个感知查询和708个推理评估。

Result: 评估了14种最先进的MLLMs，结果显示这些模型在感知和推理能力上表现出初步但不稳定的水平，临床应用的准确性不足。

Conclusion: 尽管现有的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在医学图像质量评估（IQA）中展现出初步的感知和推理能力，但其准确性和稳定性仍不足以可靠地应用于临床。MedQ-Bench的引入旨在推动MLLMs在医学IQA领域的进一步优化和探索。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

Motivation: 现有的视觉模型在理解实例级几何关系时依赖昂贵的输入格式（如类别标签、二进制分割掩码）和推理成本（二次方的前向传播次数），限制了其应用。

Method: InstaFormer利用对象查询和潜在掩码描述符之间的交互，语义上表示相同对象并携带互补信息，实现全场景实例的遮挡和深度顺序预测。

Result: InstaFormer在单次前向传播中成功预测全场景实例的遮挡和深度顺序，并通过全面基准测试和消融研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: InstaFormer通过单次前向传播预测完整的遮挡和深度顺序，显著降低了推理成本，并通过开源代码和模型促进了社区的应用与发展。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this

Motivation: 现有的CNN和基于Transformer的模型在复杂风格和高分辨率输入上难以高效扩展。

Method: 引入了PyramidStyler，一个带有金字塔位置编码（PPE）的Transformer框架，结合强化学习动态优化风格化。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和WikiArt上训练后，PyramidStyler在4000个周期后内容损失减少62.6%（至2.07），风格损失减少57.4%（至0.86），推理时间1.39秒；使用RL后进一步改进（内容2.03；风格0.75），速度仅轻微下降（1.40秒）。

Conclusion: PyramidStyler展示了实时、高质量的艺术渲染能力，在媒体和设计领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media

Motivation: 现有方法在扩展3D高斯泼溅到大场景时存在负载不平衡和效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: LoBE-GS 通过深度感知分区、优化策略和轻量级技术，显著提升了大规模场景的3D高斯泼溅训练效率，同时保持了重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

Result: 实现了分钟级时间一致性，计算效率高且复杂度线性。

Conclusion: MemoryPack和Direct Forcing显著提升了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性，推动了自回归视频模型的实用化。

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Conclusion: 结合提出的损失项和等渗回归方法，能够最佳地校准CenterPoint和PillarNet的主导和次要类别预测，但DSVT-Pillar无法通过相同方法实现联合校准。

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Conclusion: DiffPS通过利用预训练的扩散模型和三个专门设计的模块，在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

Conclusion: FMU通过将流匹配生成先验嵌入深度展开框架，显著提升了HSI重建质量，并在模拟和真实数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于YOLOv7和ConSinGAN的自动化缺陷检测系统，用于DIP组件的表面和引脚缺陷检测，准确率高且易于扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业组件的缺陷检测耗时耗力，给质检人员带来巨大负担且难以管理产品质量，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用数字相机光学和基于深度学习的模型，结合ConSinGAN生成数据集，研究了四种YOLO模型（v3、v4、v7、v9），并开发了SCADA系统及相关传感器架构。

Result: YOLOv7结合ConSinGAN在准确率达到95.50%，检测时间为285毫秒，显著优于其他YOLO版本和阈值方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于YOLOv7和ConSinGAN的自动化缺陷检测系统在准确率和检测时间上均优于其他YOLO版本和阈值方法，且易于扩展到多种缺陷类型或数据不足的情况。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

TL;DR: FoundAD利用基础视觉编码器和非线性投影算子，在少样本条件下高效检测图像异常，性能优越且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本异常检测在工业安全检查中具有重要应用，但样本有限且类别无关条件下区分正常与异常特征具有挑战性。

Method: 利用大规模预训练的基础视觉编码器学习正常图像的通用分布，设计非线性投影算子到自然图像流形上，以识别异常区域。

Result: 实验表明，FoundAD在多类检测中表现优异，参数量显著少于现有方法，并通过多种基础编码器验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FoundAD通过非线性投影算子有效识别图像中的异常区域，支持多类检测，性能优越且参数更少。该方法为少样本异常检测领域提供了新视角。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers在密集预测任务（如语义分割）中因二次注意力复杂度导致的实用性受限问题。

Method: 在Vision Transformer（ViT）基础上扩展，引入Cluster模块根据分割掩码的伪聚类合并相似token，并通过Regenerator模块恢复细节。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上实现了高达2.18倍的GFLOPs减少和1.64倍的推理加速，且分割精度相当。

Conclusion: ClustViT通过引入可训练的Cluster模块和Regenerator模块，显著降低了Vision Transformers的计算复杂度，同时保持了语义分割的准确性，为机器人系统中的实际应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖间接表示（如生成坐标作为文本），限制了性能且无法支持密集预测任务（如分割）。

Method: PaDT 通过 Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs) 直接生成文本和视觉输出，使用轻量级解码器进行预测，并动态扩展嵌入表以改进定位和区分相似对象。

Result: PaDT 在四个视觉任务中表现优异，代码已开源。

Conclusion: PaDT 方法在多种视觉感知和理解任务中实现了最先进的性能，即使与更大的 MLLM 模型相比也是如此。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

Motivation: 在线果蔬电商的‘信任赤字’源于数字交易无法直接感知产品质量，传统绝对分级标准在生物特性、时效性和经济可行性之间存在‘不可能三角’限制。

Method: 研究采用‘双源验证’构建‘信任金字塔’模型，提出TTI量化分级权衡，并设计TriAlignXA框架，包含生物适应引擎、时效优化引擎和经济优化引擎，通过多目标优化实现透明决策。

Result: 实验证明TriAlignXA框架在分级任务中准确率显著高于基线模型，理论和实证分析验证了其平衡‘不可能三角’的能力。

Conclusion: 本研究通过构建‘信任金字塔’模型和‘三角信任指数’（TTI），提出了可解释AI框架TriAlignXA，有效解决了农产品分级中的‘不可能三角’问题，为建立可信的在线农产品生态系统提供了理论与实践支持。

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决4D高斯溅射（4DGS）编辑中的视图、时间、非编辑区域一致性及复杂文本指令处理问题。

Method: 1. 引入4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型，结合4D VGGT几何特征。2. 使用多视图网格模块迭代优化多视图输入图像。3. 通过高斯选择机制保持非编辑区域的连贯性。4. 设计基于LLM的用户意图理解模块。

Result: 相比现有方法，4DGS-Craft实现了更一致和可控的4D场景编辑，并能处理复杂用户指令。

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft框架通过引入4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型、多视图网格模块和高斯选择机制，实现了更一致和可控的4D场景编辑。用户意图理解模块进一步提升了编辑性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级超分辨率方法（如CAMixer）存在适应性差、掩蔽粗糙和空间不灵活等问题。

Method: 提出Pure-Pass（PP）机制，利用固定颜色中心点对像素分类，实现细粒度、空间灵活的掩蔽。

Result: PP-ATD-light在重建质量和参数效率上均优于CAMixer-ATD-light，且计算开销相近。

Conclusion: PP-ATD-light通过像素级掩蔽机制（Pure-Pass）显著提升了图像超分辨率性能，在保持计算效率的同时优于CAMixer-ATD-light。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

TL;DR: 研究利用GPT-4o和SLSO框架自动生成颌骨囊肿发现，显著提高了牙号识别等项目的准确性，但广泛病变识别仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用OpenAI GPT-4o的多模态能力自动生成牙科全景X光片上的颌骨囊肿发现，并通过SLSO框架提高准确性。

Method: 本研究构建了一个带结构化输出的自校正循环（SLSO）框架，并通过10步流程验证其有效性，包括图像输入与分析、结构化数据生成、牙号提取与一致性检查、检测到不一致时的迭代再生以及发现生成与后续结构化和一致性验证。

Result: SLSO框架在多个评估项目上提高了输出准确性，牙号、牙齿移动和牙根吸收的改善率分别为66.9%、33.3%和28.6%。在成功案例中，经过最多五次再生后实现了结构一致的输出。

Conclusion: 尽管由于数据集规模较小未达到统计学显著性，但整体SLSO框架强化了阴性结果描述，抑制了幻觉，并提高了牙号识别准确性。然而，对于跨越多个牙齿的广泛病变的准确识别仍有限。未来需进一步优化以提升整体性能，迈向实用的发现生成系统。

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Conclusion: LiLa-Net通过优化编码器层数和简化跳跃连接，实现了高效且具有代表性的潜在空间，能够准确重建原始点云，并在不牺牲性能的情况下提高了重建质量。此外，模型展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which

LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization

Conclusion: kabr-tools 提供了一种强大的自动化行为监测工具，推动了生态系统范围的研究，促进了保护、生物多样性研究和生态监测的进展。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Motivation: 当前方法通常依赖点云或需要预定义同胚映射，限制了语义感知3D形状和纹理变形的能力。

Method: 该方法利用网格引导的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）进行高保真几何和外观建模，采用统一变形策略将3D高斯锚定到重建的网格块上，并通过拓扑感知约束保持纹理保真度。

Result: GaussianMorphing在保持局部细节和全局语义一致性的同时，无需标记数据即可实现高保真变形。

Conclusion: GaussianMorphing在TexMorph基准测试中显著优于现有2D/3D方法，颜色一致性误差（ΔE）降低了22.2%，EI降低了26.2%。

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

Conclusion: InPose方法通过结合预训练的扩散模型和仅基于旋转测量的条件，实现了零样本泛化，有效解决了传统方法因用户体型差异导致的泛化问题。

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Conclusion: VGDM框架通过结合视觉Transformer和扩散模型，显著提升了脑肿瘤检测和分割的准确性和边界精度，超越了传统的U-Net方法。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Conclusion: 本研究开发了一种可扩展的深度学习流程，成功填补了法国1970年代前全国城市扩张数据分析的空白，并公开了代码、训练数据集及全国城市栅格数据，为长期城市化动态研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究点跟踪在复杂手术环境中的可靠性和失败案例，特别是在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中的应用。

Method: 系统分析了腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中点跟踪的失败模式，比较了点跟踪与分割掩码初始化的性能。

Result: 点跟踪在手术工具上表现良好，但在解剖目标上表现不佳。通过定性分析，揭示了影响跟踪结果的关键因素，并提供了改进建议。

Conclusion: 点跟踪在手术工具上的表现具有竞争力，但在解剖目标上表现不佳，主要由于组织相似性和边界模糊导致失败。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在语义分割任务中因域偏移和未标记客户端数据带来的挑战，同时利用现代视觉基础模型的潜力。

Method: 利用Vision-Language解码器和CLIP-based文本嵌入增强语义消歧，采用弱到强一致性学习策略进行伪标签的鲁棒本地训练。

Result: 在合成到真实和清晰到恶劣天气基准测试中表现优异，与现有领域泛化和适应方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: FRIEREN框架通过整合视觉和语言模态，有效解决了FFREEDG任务，为未来研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

TL;DR: ASK-Hint通过结构化提示框架提升视频异常检测性能，无需训练即可实现高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法过于抽象，忽略了细粒度的人机交互或动作语义，影响了复杂异常的检测效果。

Method: 提出ASK-Hint框架，利用动作中心知识组织语义连贯的提示组和细粒度引导问题。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上，ASK-Hint的AUC表现优于现有基线，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ASK-Hint通过结构化提示框架显著提升了视频异常检测的准确性和可解释性，成为无需训练且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPurify通过几何先验和亲和力网络净化2D到3D特征转移，显著减少数据需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D到3D特征转移方法在直接投影2D特征到3D时产生噪声和碎片化预测，而强制几何一致性则需要昂贵的训练流程和大规模标注的3D数据。这种限制源于主流的‘分割-匹配’范式未能将2D语义与3D几何结构融合。

Method: 提出GeoPurify方法，应用小型学生亲和力网络，利用从3D自监督教师模型中提取的几何先验来净化2D VLM生成的3D点特征。在推理阶段，设计了几何引导池化模块以进一步去噪点云并确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在主要3D基准测试上的广泛实验表明，GeoPurify在仅使用约1.5%的训练数据的情况下，达到或超越了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GeoPurify通过利用潜在的几何信息和学习的亲和力网络，有效缓解了2D到3D特征转移中的权衡问题，并在仅使用约1.5%的训练数据的情况下达到或超越了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 解决密集和遮挡场景中离散检测方法无法准确计数的问题，并探索多类别计数在生态保护等新领域的应用。

Method: 提出了一种基于Twins金字塔视觉变换器骨干网络和专门多类别计数头的多类别计数框架，结合双任务设计和类别聚焦模块，有效抑制了训练时的类别间干扰。

Result: 在VisDrone和iSAID基准测试中，MAE分别降低了33%、43%和64%，优于现有方法，且在与YOLOv11的比较中证明了其在密集场景中的必要性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的多类别计数框架和区域损失设计，不仅在密集场景中显著优于现有方法，还扩展了多类别人群计数在新领域的应用潜力，如生物多样性监测。

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

TL;DR: TempoControl 通过优化交叉注意力图实现了视频生成中的时间控制，无需重新训练或额外监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成视频模型缺乏细粒度的时间控制，无法让用户指定视觉元素在生成序列中的具体出现时间。

Method: TempoControl 利用文本到视频扩散模型中的交叉注意力图，通过一种新颖的优化方法（包括相关性、能量和熵三个原则）来引导视觉概念的时间安排。

Result: TempoControl 在多种视频生成应用中展示了有效性，包括单对象和多对象的时间重排序，以及动作和音频对齐的生成。

Conclusion: TempoControl 是一种无需重新训练或额外监督的方法，通过交叉注意力图实现了视频生成中视觉概念的时间对齐，为生成高质量和多样化的视频提供了精确的时间控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

<details>

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在结构化、信息丰富的环境中（如交通地图）进行细粒度视觉推理时的性能不足问题。

Method: 提出了RewardMap，一个多阶段强化学习框架，包含难度感知奖励设计和从简单感知到复杂推理任务的分阶段训练策略。

Result: 在ReasonMap和ReasonMap-Plus数据集上的实验表明，RewardMap的每个组件都带来了性能提升，组合使用效果最佳，且在6个基准测试中平均提升了3.47%。

Conclusion: RewardMap框架通过难度感知奖励设计和多阶段RL策略，显著提升了MLLMs在细粒度视觉推理任务中的性能，并在多个基准测试中实现了平均3.47%的改进。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于拖拽的图像编辑因早期模型先验不足而存在目标区域失真问题，而FLUX等更强先验模型尚未被有效利用。

Method: DragFlow提出了一种区域编辑范式，利用仿射变换提供更丰富一致的特征监督，并整合了预训练适配器和MLLM以增强一致性和解决任务模糊性。

Result: DragFlow在DragBench-DR和ReD Bench上超越所有基线方法，成为新的最先进技术。

Conclusion: DragFlow通过整合FLUX的强大先验、区域编辑范式、预训练适配器和MLLM，显著提升了基于拖拽的图像编辑性能，并在新基准ReD Bench上取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F2C方法通过选择时间连贯的关键片段而非孤立帧，显著提升了视频大语言模型的性能，同时在固定计算预算内保持标记数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频大语言模型（VLMs）由于从原始视频帧产生的大量视觉标记耗尽了模型的上下文窗口，导致实际应用受限。现有的解决方案通过选择稀疏的帧集来减少标记数量，但这种帧级选择丢弃了基本的时间动态信息，导致对运动和事件连续性的推理不理想。

Method: 提出了一种自适应分辨率策略，动态平衡空间分辨率和片段长度，确保每个视频的标记数量恒定。

Result: 在Video-MME、LongVideoBench和MLVU基准测试中，F2C方法分别比均匀采样提高了8.1%、5.6%和10.3%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为F2C的训练无关方法，通过从孤立的关键帧扩展到关键片段（短且时间连贯的片段）来改善视频理解，并在三个长视频基准测试中表现出色，证明了保持时间连贯性的重要性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Conclusion: NeuroSwift通过结合低层特征和高层语义的适配器，实现了跨受试者的高效视觉刺激重建，显著提升了性能并降低了计算需求。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: CLIP依赖粗粒度全局特征，限制了其在细粒度分类任务中的表现，需要一种能捕捉微观局部线索的适配方法。

Method: 提出了Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)和TokenFusion模块，结合两头部LLM衍生分类器和动态知识聚合技术，实现细粒度信号的有效提取。

Conclusion: microCLIP通过自训练框架显著提升了CLIP在细粒度图像分类任务中的性能，平均准确率提高了2.90%，且仅需轻量级适配。

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1通过GRPO优化的多模态大语言模型，不仅能高精度检测AI生成视频，还提供可解释的预测依据，为监管和终端用户提供了透明工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在物理逼真的物体交互和物理基础控制机制方面存在不足，KineMask旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段训练策略，逐步减少对物体未来运动的监督，结合视频扩散模型（VDMs）在合成场景中训练。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中均表现出物体交互的显著改进，并通过实验证明其优于同类模型。

Conclusion: KineMask通过两阶段训练策略和物理引导的视频生成方法，显著提升了物体交互的真实性，并在实验中展现出优于同类模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Motivation: Current video models lack fine-grained control needed for general-purpose household robots to handle delicate tasks and urgent situations.

Method: A feature learning paradigm aligning multimodal senses while preserving unique information, along with a regularization scheme to enhance causality of action trajectory features.

Result: Experiments show improved simulation accuracy and reduced temporal drift, with extensive ablation studies and downstream applications validating the approach.

Conclusion: Incorporating multimodal senses significantly improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

Motivation: 多模态语言模型在视频理解中因上下文长度限制而表现不佳，常错过关键过渡帧且难以维持长时间尺度的连贯性。

Method: 采用Native Sparse Attention (NSA)技术，通过端到端训练在216K视频指令数据集上调整Qwen2.5-VL模型，使用硬件感知的混合注意力方法（文本密集注意力，视频稀疏注意力）。

Result: VideoNSA在长视频理解、时空推理和空间基准测试中表现优于基于令牌压缩和无训练稀疏基线的方法，并揭示了四点关键发现。

Conclusion: VideoNSA通过适应Qwen2.5-VL模型，采用硬件感知的混合注意力方法，显著提升了长视频理解和时空推理能力，并揭示了四点关键发现。

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseShift recalibrates noise levels by resolution, improving low-resolution image quality without architectural changes, as shown by FID score boosts in SD3.5, SD3, and Flux-Dev.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution text-to-image generators lack budget-efficient alternatives for users needing lower resolutions, due to unequal perceptual effects of noise schedulers across resolutions.

Method: NoiseShift, a training-free method that recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size, without requiring changes to model architecture or sampling schedule.

Result: NoiseShift improved SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on LAION-COCO, and by 10.36%, 5.19%, and 3.02% on CelebA, respectively.

Conclusion: NoiseShift effectively mitigates resolution-dependent artifacts and enhances low-resolution image generation quality, as demonstrated by significant improvements in FID scores across multiple models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

Motivation: 研究从视频中预测动态物理属性的任务，特别是需要时间信息推断的属性（如弹性、粘度和动态摩擦）。

Method: 探索了三种方法：(a) Oracle方法，使用经典计算机视觉技术；(b) 简单读出机制，使用视觉提示和可训练提示向量进行跨注意力；(c) MLLMs的提示策略。

Result: 收集了新的视频数据集，并比较了不同方法的性能。生成或自监督视频基础模型表现接近Oracle，MLLMs表现较差但可通过提示改进。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型在生成或自监督训练方式下表现相似，但略逊于Oracle方法；MLLMs目前表现较差，但通过合适的提示策略可以提升性能。

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种多模态对象感知框架，通过结合视觉和听觉信息，成功实现了对日常物体交互声音的识别，并在新任务及现有多模态动作理解任务中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Method: 本文提出了一种密度引导的投毒攻击方法，利用KDE识别低密度区域并策略性注入高斯点，同时引入自适应噪声策略破坏多视角一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在嵌入虚假对象和破坏多视角一致性方面优于现有技术，并通过KDE评估协议系统化评估了攻击难度。

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像（T2I）模型在多主题描述中存在的问题，如属性泄漏、身份纠缠和主题遗漏。

Method: 提出了两种与架构无关的算法：一是无需训练、测试时的控制器，通过单次更新扰动基础速度；二是Adjoint Matching，一种轻量级微调规则，通过回归控制网络到反向伴随信号来保留基础模型能力。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3.5、FLUX和Stable Diffusion XL上，两种算法均显著提高了多主题对齐性，同时保持了基础模型的风格。测试时的控制器在普通GPU上高效运行，微调后的控制器在有限提示下训练后能泛化到未见过的提示。

Conclusion: FOCUS（Flow Optimal Control for Unentangled Subjects）在多主题图像生成任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了基础模型的风格。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Motivation: 解决移动边缘设备上低延迟、截止时间约束的DNN卸载问题。

Method: 设计了一种调度算法，考虑了设备可用性、网络链路通信、优先级感知抢占和任务截止时间，并通过资源可用性表示、网络离散化和动态带宽估计机制来降低延迟。

Result: 在高负载下，新型的低延迟抽象模型表现更优，动态带宽估计提高了任务吞吐量。

Conclusion: 新型的低延迟抽象模型在高负载下表现更优，动态带宽估计有助于任务分配，最终在资源稀缺时提高了任务吞吐量。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution for low-latency deadline-constrained DNN
offloading on mobile edge devices. We design a scheduling algorithm with
lightweight network state representation, considering device availability,
communication on the network link, priority-aware pre-emption, and task
deadlines. The scheduling algorithm aims to reduce latency by designing a
resource availability representation, as well as a network discretisation and a
dynamic bandwidth estimation mechanism. We implement the scheduling algorithm
into a system composed of four Raspberry Pi 2 (model Bs) mobile edge devices,
sampling a waste classification conveyor belt at a set frame rate. The system
is evaluated and compared to a previous approach of ours, which was proven to
outcompete work-stealers and a non-pre-emption based scheduling heuristic under
the aforementioned waste classification scenario. Our findings show the novel
lower latency abstraction models yield better performance under high-volume
workloads, with the dynamic bandwidth estimation assisting the task placement
while, ultimately, increasing task throughput in times of resource scarcity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链用户重视可扩展性，期望快速确认和即时交易处理。

Method: Odontoceti采用了一种新颖的决策规则来提交区块，创建了一个未认证的DAG，并在参与者速度较慢时优化进展。

Result: Odontoceti在现实网络条件下实现了300毫秒的中位延迟和每秒10,000笔交易的吞吐量，相比现有生产协议延迟改善了20-25%。

Conclusion: 本文确立了低容错共识协议在区块链中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Users of blockchains value scalability, expecting fast confirmations and
immediate transaction processing. Odontoceti, the latest in DAG-based
consensus, addresses these concerns by prioritizing low latency and high
throughput, making a strategic trade-off in security by operating with a 20%
fault tolerance instead of the established 33% level. It is the first DAG-based
protocol to achieve commitment in just two communication rounds, delivering
median latency of 300 milliseconds while processing 10,000 transactions per
second under realistic network conditions. Odontoceti operates with n = 5f + 1
validators and creates an uncertified DAG with a novel decision rule for
committing blocks. The protocol includes an optimization that advances progress
when participants are slow, benefiting crash fault scenarios which are more
common in practice than Byzantine faults. Evaluation results demonstrate 20-25%
latency improvements compared to an existing production protocol, validating
that reducing wave length from three rounds to two rounds yields meaningful
performance benefits. This paper establishes the practical viability of lower
fault tolerance consensus protocols for blockchains.

Abstract: As AI cluster sizes continue to expand and the demand for
large-language-model (LLM) training and inference workloads grows rapidly,
traditional scheduling systems face significant challenges in balancing
resource utilization, scheduling efficiency, and service quality. This paper
presents and evaluates Kant: an efficient unified scheduling platform designed
for large-scale AI container clusters, supporting the co-scheduling of both
training and inference jobs. Based on the practical implementation of the Kant
system, we systematically define a set of key evaluation metrics for AI
clusters, including GPU Allocation Ratio (GAR), Scheduling Occupancy Rate
(SOR), GPU Node Fragmentation Ratio (GFR), Job Waiting Time Distribution
(JWTD), and Job Training Time Estimation Distribution (JTTED), providing a
foundation for quantitative performance analysis. Experimental results
demonstrate that Kant achieves exceptional performance in clusters ranging from
hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs. By leveraging scheduling strategies such
as Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves
resource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing
resource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training. The
system has been deployed in multiple AI data center clusters, where it stably
supports large-scale intelligent computing workloads. This work provides a
practical engineering approach for building high-performance, highly available,

Result: QScale在每进程通信复杂度、总通信复杂度和延迟方面均表现优异，适合中等规模系统。

Conclusion: QScale协议通过优化通信复杂度和延迟，为中等规模的分布式账本系统提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing distributed ledger protocols either incur a high communication
complexity and are thus suited to systems with a small number of processes
(e.g., PBFT), or rely on committee-sampling-based approaches that only work for
a very large number of processes (e.g., Algorand). Neither of these lines of
work is well-suited for moderate-scale distributed ledgers ranging from a few
hundred to a thousand processes, which are common in production (e.g, Redbelly,
Sui). The goal of this work is to design a distributed ledger with sub-linear
communication complexity per process, sub-quadratic total communication
complexity, and low latency for finalizing a block into the ledger, such that
it can be used for moderate-scale systems. We propose QScale, a protocol in
which every process incurs only $\widetilde{O}(\kappa \sqrt{n})$ communication
complexity per-block in expectation, $\widetilde{O}(n\kappa)$ total
communication complexity per-block in expectation, and a best-case latency of
$O(\kappa)$ rounds while ensuring safety and liveness with overwhelming
probability, with $\kappa$ being a small security parameter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RISC-V加速器通常需要特定的编程模型和API，这对于用Fortran编写的复杂科学计算代码来说不切实际。

Method: 提出了一种方法，允许Fortran代码直接与RISC-V加速器交互，无需重写现有代码。

Result: 该方法成功实现了Fortran代码与RISC-V加速器的直接交互，避免了代码重开发。

Conclusion: 通过提供一种方法，使Fortran代码能够直接驱动RISC-V加速器，避免了代码重写的需求，为高性能计算领域提供了更高效和便捷的解决方案。

Abstract: A range of RISC-V based accelerators are available and coming to market, and
there is strong potential for these to be used for High Performance Computing
(HPC) workloads. However, such accelerators tend to provide bespoke programming
models and APIs that require codes to be rewritten. In scientific computing,
where many of the simulation code are highly complex, extensive, and written in
Fortran, this is not realistic. In this extended abstract we present an
approach that enables driving such architectures via Fortran, avoiding code
redevelopment.

TL;DR: OR-Toolformer通过工具增强微调LLMs，提高了OR问题解决的准确性和泛化能力，同时解决了隐私和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决依赖闭源API带来的隐私问题，以及从头训练开源模型的高计算成本问题。

Method: 通过半自动数据合成管道生成多样化的OR问题-答案对，并增强模型以产生API调用，对Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct进行微调。

Result: 在四个标准基准测试中的三个上，OR-Toolformer达到80.1%的执行准确率，超过基线4.3%；在未见过的OR问题类型上，零样本评估平均准确率为54%，比最强基线提高21个百分点。

Conclusion: OR-Toolformer通过工具增强的微调方法，证明了其在OR问题建模和解决中的高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

TL;DR: ROTE通过程序合成预测人类行为，结合LLMs和概率推理，在稀疏观察下表现优于基线方法50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类行为建模方法通常数据需求大且脆弱，因为它们要么对理性做出不切实际的假设，要么计算量过大难以快速适应。

Method: ROTE算法结合大型语言模型（LLMs）合成行为程序假设空间，并利用概率推理处理不确定性。

Result: 在网格世界任务和大型家庭模拟器中，ROTE从稀疏观察中预测人类和AI行为，样本内准确性和样本外泛化能力比基线方法（包括行为克隆和基于LLM的方法）高出50%。

Conclusion: 通过将行为理解为程序合成问题，ROTE为AI系统在现实世界中高效有效预测人类行为开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Motivation: 现有AI系统在跨学科协作和探索未知问题方面存在局限性，因此提出了CA-ChemE系统来解决这些问题。

Method: 通过整合领域特定知识库、知识增强技术和协作智能体，构建了一个能够进行深度专业推理和高效跨学科协作的智能生态系统。

Result: 知识库增强机制将对话质量评分平均提高了10-15%，而协作智能体（CA）的引入显著改善了跨域协作效率，尤其是远域专家对的效率提升了8.5%。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，精心设计的多智能体架构可以为化学工程中的自主科学发现提供可行途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多代理辩论框架，用于评估LLM代理的社交行为，发现代理倾向于共识，角色分配稳定且可测量，监督员角色影响辩论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）从静态工具转变为自主代理，传统的下游任务性能评估基准变得不足，无法捕捉交互环境中代理沟通、说服和协作时出现的社会和认知动态。

Method: 引入了一个新颖的评估框架，利用多代理辩论作为受控的“社交实验室”来发现和量化这些行为。LLM代理在LLM监督员的监督下，以不同角色和动机进行辩论。

Result: 在数百场辩论中发现代理倾向于寻求共识，即使在没有明确指令的情况下也能达到高语义一致性（μ > 0.88）。分配的角色诱导了稳定的心理测量特征，特别是认知努力，监督员的角色能显著改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 本研究为下一代AI代理的社交行为理解和塑造提供了关键方法，提出了动态、心理测量基础的新评估协议蓝图。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AGILE 是一种通过交互式学习和环境反馈增强视觉语言模型感知和推理能力的方法，显著提升了拼图任务和通用视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在核心感知和推理能力上存在不足，特别是在简单拼图任务上表现接近随机，高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺和扩展性限制了模型能力的提升。

Method: AGILE 将拼图任务嵌为一个交互式过程，模型通过生成可执行代码进行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈，形成观察-交互的循环过程。

Result: AGILE 在多种复杂度的拼图任务上显著提升性能（如2x2设置下准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%），并在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%，显示出感知和推理能力的显著增强。

Conclusion: AGILE 通过交互式学习和环境反馈显著提升了视觉语言模型的感知和推理能力，为多模态模型的推理和泛化能力提供了新的研究方向，并解决了多模态强化学习数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文和记忆基准测试主要关注对话实例，但在动态企业环境中评估记忆能力对其有效应用至关重要。

Method: 通过结合手动专家驱动设计和基于代理的可扩展合成，创建了一个生态有效的数据集，模拟了真实软件开发过程中的多平台交互。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的LLM和记忆后端在处理长期记忆、跨平台依赖和解决矛盾方面仍面临挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上的正确率仅为60%。

Conclusion: MEMTRACK提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于在复杂的组织环境中推进记忆增强代理的评估研究，超越了现有对话设置的局限，并为多代理、多平台的记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making and the rapid expansion of electronic health records (EHR) present opportunities and challenges for delivering data-informed care.

Method: The system employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to harmonize unstructured narratives and codified data, integrating natural language processing with structured clinical inputs.

Result: Preliminary evaluations with de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets suggest the model's outputs are clinically plausible and consistent.

Conclusion: LLM-based tools can offer valuable decision support in prescribing workflows when properly constrained and validated, marking an initial step towards integrating generative AI into clinical decision-making with a focus on transparency and safety.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

TL;DR: TRACE 是一种检测隐性奖励黑客行为的方法，通过量化模型使用的“努力”来识别漏洞，在数学和编码任务中显著优于现有监控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为（Reward hacking）是一个重大威胁，模型可能利用奖励函数的漏洞获得高奖励而不解决实际任务。TRACE 旨在检测隐性的奖励黑客行为。

Method: TRACE 通过逐步截断模型的思维链（CoT）在不同长度，强制模型回答，并测量每个截断点的验证通过率，量化模型使用的“努力”。

Result: TRACE 在数学推理任务中比最强的 72B CoT 监控器提升了超过 65%，在编码任务中比 32B 监控器提升了超过 30%，并能发现训练中的未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE 提供了一种可扩展的无监督方法，用于在当前监控方法无效的情况下进行监督，能够发现训练中的未知漏洞。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

Motivation: 解决LLM代理在多步任务中常见的失败模式，如尝试未满足前提条件的行动、发出冗余命令或错误处理环境约束，同时避免检索增强生成方法的外部知识库维护和计算开销。

Method: 提出了一种简单的管道，包括从代理失败中提取紧凑、可重用的提示，利用这些提示生成改进的教师轨迹，并通过蒸馏训练学生模型以内部化知识而非记忆。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop两个交互基准测试中，蒸馏学生模型分别达到91%和72的成绩，显著优于基线模型（79%和61），同时减少了10-60%的令牌使用。

Conclusion: 通过蒸馏学习将检索增强生成的运行时优势转化为内部化能力，显著提升了LLM代理在多步任务中的表现，同时减少了计算开销和运行时依赖。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

TL;DR: LLM agents automate data-driven modeling for regression tasks, outperforming traditional methods and matching expert-developed models in predictive accuracy and UQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on large datasets in engineering and the limitations of traditional data-driven methods (extensive manual intervention, poor scalability, and generalization) drive the need for automated, efficient modeling strategies.

Method: The study proposes an innovative pipeline using LLM agents (multi-agent and single-agent ReAct frameworks) to automate data-driven modeling, specifically for regression tasks, handling preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter optimization, and UQ.

Result: The LLM-agent-developed model outperforms traditional CHF lookup tables and matches the predictive accuracy and UQ of state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural networks developed by human experts.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents demonstrate significant potential in automating complex engineering modeling tasks, achieving or surpassing human expert performance while reducing manual workload.

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

TL;DR: OntoLogX利用LLMs将原始日志转化为基于本体的知识图谱，有效链接日志证据到对抗目标，提升CTI提取的精确率和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志作为网络威胁情报（CTI）的重要来源，常因缺乏结构、语义不一致和设备间碎片化而受限。提取可操作的CTI需要将嘈杂、异构数据转化为连贯且可互操作的表示。

Method: OntoLogX利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将原始日志转化为基于本体的知识图谱（KGs），结合检索增强生成（RAG）和迭代校正步骤确保生成的KGs在语法和语义上的有效性，并通过LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术。

Result: OntoLogX在公共基准和真实世界蜜罐数据集上展示了稳健的KG生成能力，并准确映射对抗活动到ATT&CK战术，验证了检索和校正对精确率和召回率的提升。

Conclusion: OntoLogX通过结合轻量级日志本体、检索增强生成（RAG）和迭代校正步骤，成功将原始日志转化为基于本体的知识图谱（KGs），并有效链接低级别日志证据到高级别对抗目标，展示了其在可操作CTI提取中的价值。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the

TL;DR: Falconer结合LLMs和轻量代理模型，高效且低成本地实现了大规模知识挖掘，性能接近LLMs但成本大幅降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类器和提取器管道效率高但脆弱且无法泛化到新任务，而LLMs虽擅长解释指令但部署成本过高。Falconer旨在结合两者优势。

Method: Falconer框架中，LLMs充当规划者和注释者，分解用户指令为可执行管道并生成监督数据以训练小型代理模型。框架将分类和提取统一为两个原子操作。

Result: 实验表明，Falconer在指令遵循准确性上接近最先进的LLMs，同时减少高达90%的推理成本，并加速大规模知识挖掘超过20倍。

Conclusion: Falconer框架通过结合LLMs的代理推理与轻量级代理模型，显著降低了推理成本并加速了大规模知识挖掘，为深度研究提供了高效且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Motivation: AI教育社区常忽视专家精心策划的知识在创建高效教学系统中的作用，本文旨在探讨其在开发新型教育系统中的潜力。

Method: 论文探讨了两种利用专家知识的方法：一是使用可解释AI（XAI）技术自动生成课程，二是利用专家指定的学习课程开发自适应教学系统。

Result: 研究表明，结合专家知识和XAI技术可以自动生成课程，且专家指定的课程能帮助开发更高效的自适应教学系统。

Conclusion: 论文强调了专家精心策划的知识在创建高效教育系统中的重要性，并通过案例研究展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

TL;DR: VOGUE通过量化视觉不确定性指导探索，提升多模态LLMs的推理能力，显著提高了多个基准的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法将视觉输入视为固定、确定性条件，忽略了潜在的模糊性，难以构建对视觉变化鲁棒的策略。因此，需要一种新方法来改善多模态LLMs的探索能力。

Method: VOGUE方法通过将图像视为随机上下文，利用对称KL散度量化和比较原始与噪声分支的策略敏感性，创建不确定性感知探索信号。结合不确定性比例奖励、令牌熵奖励和退火采样计划，有效平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升2.6%的pass@1准确率，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时改善了pass@4性能并缓解了RL微调中常见的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，将探索基于视觉输入的固有不确定性是一种有效策略，可提升多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

TL;DR: LToT是一种新型树状搜索控制器，通过分离效用与逻辑一致性，有效解决大型测试计算预算下的搜索问题，保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代部署中大量测试计算预算的分配导致标准树状搜索方法出现广度饱和和深度短视的问题，需要一种新方法来提升多样性并保持计算效率。

Method: LToT采用LR--SC方法，通过有限制的连续减半竞赛和短小探测，探索低效用但逻辑一致的候选路径，并在达到主线路标准时立即提升分支。

Result: 理论分析表明LToT的侧向成本为伪线性增长，避免了主线路的指数增长，同时保持了计算的效率。

Conclusion: LToT通过将逻辑一致性与效用分离，有效解决了大型测试计算预算下的广度饱和和深度短视问题，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

Method: 提出了一种结合稀疏自编码器（SAEs）和聚类技术的方法，首先训练SAE生成稀疏向量表示，然后应用k-means聚类构建图结构，其中顶点代表标记簇，加权边捕捉顺序标记转换。基于边权重的奖励函数用于量化对已建立推理轨迹的遵循程度。

Result: 研究发现，平衡利用和探索对于数学推理任务的高准确性至关重要。SAE可以作为可扩展的奖励模型，有效引导生成过程。

Conclusion: 平衡利用和探索对于在数学推理任务中实现高准确性至关重要。SAE可以作为可扩展的奖励模型来引导生成，确保利用与探索之间的平衡，从而在LLMs中促进更高质量的推理过程。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

Method: 提出了一种称为 LOGicalThought (LogT) 的神经符号架构，结合高级逻辑语言和推理器与大型语言模型，构建双重符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文。

Result: 在四个多领域基准测试中，LogT 相比四个基线模型，整体性能提升了 11.84%，在否定、蕴含和可废止推理三种模式中分别提升了 10.2%、13.2% 和 5.5%。

Conclusion: LOGicalThought (LogT) 是一种新颖的神经符号架构，通过结合高级逻辑语言和推理器与大型语言模型，显著提升了在高保证文本指南中的推理性能。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM规划代理在内部动态与实际环境不一致时的局限性，提升在不确定环境中的决策能力。

Method: 引入InfoSeeker框架，结合任务导向规划和信息寻求，通过主动验证、检测环境变化或假设测试来优化决策。

Result: 实验表明，InfoSeeker性能提升74%，且在多种基准测试中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: InfoSeeker通过紧密集成规划和信息寻求，在部分可观测环境中展现出更强的鲁棒性，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

TL;DR: SAPO, a new RL algorithm, improves dLLMs' reasoning by aligning denoising with hierarchical steps, outperforming current methods and increasing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning approaches for training diffusion language models often rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths. The paper addresses this by proposing a hierarchical selection process for complex problem solving.

Method: The paper introduces SAPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a process-based reward function to guide the model's iterative steps, ensuring they contribute meaningfully to the solution.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that SAPO improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

Conclusion: Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO) significantly improves the performance of diffusion language models on complex reasoning tasks by aligning the denoising process with a hierarchical reasoning structure, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，但InvThink通过逆向思维（即先推理失败模式再生成响应）提升模型安全性。

Method: 通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM家族中实施InvThink，包括枚举潜在危害、分析其后果，并生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。

Result: InvThink在安全改进方面表现出更强的模型规模扩展性，减轻了安全税，并在高风险领域（如医疗、金融、法律）和代理风险场景（如勒索、谋杀）中减少了高达15.7%的有害响应。

Conclusion: 逆向思维（InvThink）为大型语言模型（LLM）提供了一种可扩展且通用的路径，使其更安全、更强大。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Conclusion: AdvEvo-MARL 框架通过对抗性学习环境联合优化攻击者和防御者，成功将攻击成功率保持在20%以下，同时提升任务准确性，证明了安全性和实用性可以共同提升。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative

mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息论的上下文马尔可夫决策过程（CMDPs）方法，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）压缩高维上下文输入，提升决策效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMDPs方法在高维或非结构化上下文中泛化能力不足，导致计算量大且性能不稳定。

Method: 采用信息论总结方法，利用LLMs将上下文输入压缩为低维、语义丰富的摘要，以增强状态表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个基准测试中优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率和样本效率，同时降低了延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: LLM-based summarization为资源受限环境中的高效决策提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: LLMs无需外部工具即可生成有效路径，理解道路网络，但存在区域和交通模式的系统性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）的地理空间推理能力，特别是其能否读取道路网络地图并执行导航任务。

Method: 研究将轨迹恢复作为代理任务，使用GLOBALTRACE数据集（包含4,000多条真实轨迹）和道路网络作为上下文，设计了提示框架使LLMs能够生成路径。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在轨迹恢复任务中优于现成的基线模型和专用轨迹恢复模型，并展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）在无需外部导航工具的情况下能够有效生成路径，并展现出对道路网络和坐标系统的深刻理解。然而，模型在区域和交通模式上存在系统性偏差。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了计算机使用代理(CUAs)在追求目标时的盲目性(BGD)，开发了BLIND-ACT基准进行评估，发现前沿模型普遍存在高BGD率，提示干预效果有限，需进一步研究以确保安全部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理(CUAs)在追求目标时表现出盲目的目标导向性(BGD)，即不考虑可行性、安全性、可靠性或上下文，这带来了潜在风险。

Method: 开发了BLIND-ACT基准，包含90个任务，捕捉BGD的三种模式，并在OSWorld上构建，使用基于LLM的评估者与人类标注达到93.75%的一致性。

Result: 评估了九个前沿模型，平均BGD率为80.8%，提示干预降低了BGD水平，但风险仍然存在。定性分析揭示了执行优先偏差、思维-行动脱节和请求优先性等失败模式。

Conclusion: 识别Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD)并引入BLIND-ACT为未来研究和减轻这一基本风险奠定了基础，确保安全部署计算机使用代理(CUAs)。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

TL;DR: LENOHA是一种安全优先、本地优先的系统，通过高精度分类器和临床FAQ提供答案，避免了生成错误，显著降低能耗，适用于带宽有限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决患者在等待侵入性手术时未解答的术前问题，同时应对时间压力和隐私限制的挑战。

Method: 使用高精度句子转换器分类器路由输入，并从临床医生整理的FAQ中返回逐字答案，避免自由文本生成。在两个领域（牙齿提取和胃镜检查）上评估了四种编码器。

Result: E5-large-instruct编码器在整体准确率（0.983）、AUC（0.996）和错误总数（7）上表现优异，与GPT-4o在该任务上无统计学差异。非生成性临床路径的能耗显著低于生成性路径（约170倍差异）。

Conclusion: LENOHA架构通过返回经过验证的FAQ答案，在临床路径中避免了生成错误，同时支持隐私、可持续性和在带宽有限环境中的公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

Motivation: 传统AGI评估方法依赖直觉设计的合成任务，效果不佳，需转向更可靠的评估策略。

Method: 采用数据科学中常用的可靠部署实践，开发了一种以能力为核心的AGI评估框架。

Result: 提供了基于稳健任务执行的具体AGI评估实例，验证了新方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于稳健任务执行的AGI评估新方法，强调通过实际能力展示而非传统直觉任务来验证AGI。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

Motivation: 现有技术忽视了合成偏好注释中风格和长度偏差的噪声问题。

Method: 基于LLM引导的响应编辑框架，生成具有目标错误的拒绝响应，保持风格和长度与接受响应相似。

Result: VaPR模型在10个基准测试中平均提升了性能（LLaVA 6.5%，Qwen2VL 4.0%，Qwen2.5VL 1.5%），并在推理任务中有显著改进。

Conclusion: VaPR模型在多个基准测试中显著提升了性能，并通过减少二进制问题中的‘是’倾向解决了LVLMs的常见问题。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

TL;DR: MetaboT是一个基于LLMs和多智能体系统的AI工具，能将自然语言查询转换为SPARQL查询，显著提升知识图谱的查询准确性和易用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识图谱使用中需要深入理解其本体和查询语言语法的技术障碍，使研究人员能够通过自然语言查询访问结构化代谢组学数据。

Method: 设计了MetaboT，一个基于LLMs和多智能体系统的AI系统，通过分解复杂任务并由专门智能体处理，实现了从用户问题到SPARQL查询的自动化生成与执行。

Result: MetaboT在50个代谢组学相关问题的测试中达到了83.67%的准确率，显著高于基线LLM（GPT-4o）的8.16%。

Conclusion: MetaboT通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和多智能体系统，成功地将自然语言查询转换为SPARQL语义查询语言，显著提高了知识图谱的查询准确性和用户体验。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is
accessible at [https://metabot.holobiomicslab.eu/], and its source code is

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Method: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，分为两个阶段：首先利用高级LLM将CoT提炼为紧凑的高层指导，并进行监督微调；其次引入一种基于指导的强化学习方法，联合优化最终输出和高层指导的质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，PTA-GRPO框架在不同基础模型上均实现了稳定且显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO框架通过两阶段设计显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂任务中的推理能力，实验结果表明其在多种模型和任务中均能稳定且显著地提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

Result: 实证结果表明，密集推理奖励可以作为学习信号来激发推理，并且在奖励引导的重新排序下显著提升了预测性能（尤其是基于Llama的策略）。

Conclusion: 本研究通过将对抗性逆向强化学习（IRL）应用于大型语言模型推理，展示了密集的、令牌级别的奖励模型在过程监督中的潜力。这种方法不仅优化了推理策略的训练，还在推理时作为批评者重新排序采样轨迹，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CARS是一种改进的拒绝采样方法，通过自适应剪枝提高样本效率，同时保持语言模型分布，适用于需要高有效性和多样性的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法在贪婪约束解码和拒绝采样之间存在效率与保真度的权衡，无法同时满足有效性和样本多样性的需求。

Method: CARS采用无约束语言模型采样，并自适应地排除违反约束的后续内容，通过记录在trie中并减去其概率质量来实现。

Result: CARS在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域实验中，均表现出更高的效率和更强的样本多样性。

Conclusion: CARS通过自适应剪枝方法，在不扭曲语言模型分布的前提下，显著提高了拒绝抽样的样本效率，并在多个领域实验中验证了其高效性和样本多样性。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究评估了LLMs在集体决策中与人类社群推理的对齐性，发现对齐程度受上下文和模型特性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，研究其与人类社群推理的对齐性至关重要。

Method: 通过大规模在线实验（N=748）和模拟匹配的LLM群体，使用Lost at Sea社会心理学任务，评估不同LLM（Gemini 2.5、GPT 4.1、Claude Haiku 3.5、Gemma 3）的行为。

Result: LLMs行为各异：部分模型反映人类偏见，部分则试图掩盖或补偿这些偏见。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）在集体决策中的表现与人类社群推理的对齐程度取决于上下文、线索和模型特有的归纳偏差。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究提出一种确定性模拟框架，为AI生成的同行评审报告提供稳定标准，证明其可靠性和透明度，助力学术出版治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版生态系统面临提交量不可控和AI未受监管的双重危机，亟需新的治理模式以保障科学诚信。传统纯人工同行评审缺乏可扩展、客观的基准，导致编辑过程不透明且难以审核。

Method: 研究采用确定性模拟框架，分析了352份同行评审模拟报告，识别了系统状态的稳定指标。

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决策在所有学科中占多数（>50%），而'拒绝'率动态适应领域特定规范（如健康科学升至45%）。系统保持29%的证据锚定合规率，跨任务和领域稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流的信任提供了关键基础设施。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅提供原始数据点而缺乏语义上下文，限制了研究的灵活性和模型利用领域知识进行检测的能力。

Method: 提供了20个精心策划的表格数据集，包含结构化文本元数据，并实现了包括经典、深度学习和基于LLM的方法在内的最先进异常检测算法，以及一个无需任务特定训练的零-shot LLM框架。

Result: 实验和分析表明，语义上下文不仅提高了检测性能，还通过支持领域感知推理增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD通过恢复文本语义，为上下文感知的表格异常检测研究提供了基准，展示了语义上下文在提升检测性能和可解释性方面的重要作用。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳先前关于深层对表示学习贡献小的观点，揭示深度利用的复杂性和情境依赖性。

Method: 通过系统研究深度利用的多样性维度，包括评估协议、任务类别和模型架构。

Result: 确认深层通常不如浅层有效，但其贡献因评估设置而异；生成评估揭示中层和深层在推理和长程连贯性中的关键作用；知识和检索集中在浅层，而推理准确性依赖深层。

Conclusion: 深度在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的利用是高度异质化和上下文依赖的，强调了在解释和压缩大型模型时需要任务、指标和模型感知的视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在抽象推理上仍不及人类，仅凭准确性评估可能误导对模型能力的判断，尤其是在不同输入模态下。新评估框架更全面衡量模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨最先进的模型是否能识别和推理任务设计者预期的抽象概念，而非依赖表面模式。

Method: 研究通过不同的输入模态（文本与视觉）、是否允许使用外部Python工具以及推理模型的推理努力程度来评估模型。除了输出准确性，还细致评估了模型生成的自然语言规则。

Result: 部分基于文本的模型在输出准确性上接近人类水平，但其规则多依赖表面“捷径”，较少捕捉预期抽象。视觉模态下，模型准确性大幅下降，但规则分析显示其仍具备一定抽象推理能力。

Conclusion: 模型在抽象推理能力上仍落后于人类，仅依赖准确性评估可能会高估文本模态的抽象推理能力，同时低估视觉模态的潜力。作者提出的评估框架能更真实地反映多模态模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大量多样化且标注良好的数据，但真实数据收集成本高昂（隐私、法律限制及人工标注需求）。

Method: 结合随机模式（Stochastic Schemas）和参数化采样（Parameterized Sampling）生成多语言半结构化文档，通过概率模型控制布局、视觉结构和内容多样性。

Result: FlexDoc生成的数据在关键信息提取（KIE）任务中绝对F1分数提升高达11%，标注工作量减少90%以上。

Conclusion: FlexDoc通过合成数据生成框架有效解决了大规模文档理解模型开发中的数据获取和标注成本问题，显著提升了模型性能并降低了成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Result: 实验证实主流DRA在性能上优于增强推理模型，但仍显示出进一步改进的空间。

Conclusion: 本研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构改进和范式进步奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Result: 实验表明，UpSafe$^\circ$C在多个基准测试中显著提升了安全性，同时保持了一般任务的竞争力。

Conclusion: UpSafe$^\circ$C提出了一种动态、模块化和推理感知的LLM安全新方向，通过安全温度机制实现了效用与安全的帕累托最优前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了RLVR方法在改善大型语言模型推理能力时存在的局限性，提出了一种数据筛选算法，显著提高了Pass@$k$性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Conclusion: bBoN方法通过行为叙事实现多智能体轨迹的选择，显著提升了计算机使用代理（CUAs）的鲁棒性和成功率，接近人类水平表现。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Method: 提出推理抽象的概念，训练模型生成多个抽象描述，并通过强化学习激励模型利用这些抽象构建解决方案。

Result: RLAD训练范式显著提升了模型在复杂问题上的推理能力，且抽象生成在测试时比生成更多解决方案更有效。

Conclusion: RLAD（两玩家强化学习训练范式）通过联合训练抽象生成器和解决方案生成器，有效提升了模型在复杂问题上的推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge框架通过训练轻量级桥接网络，实现了生物信号跨模态知识的高效迁移，显著减少了可训练参数（88-99%），同时保持或提升了迁移性能。

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无GNSS环境下无人机长距离自主飞行系统，通过轻量级漂移校正方法减少漂移，并在竞赛中验证了其有效性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在GNSS缺失环境中无人机长距离飞行的挑战，包括里程计漂移、未探索区域的闭环缺失以及嵌入式平台计算能力有限的问题。

Result: 在竞赛中成功执行了千米级飞行，跨越城市、森林和开阔地带，显著减少了漂移，并在仅使用CPU的硬件上实时运行。

Abstract: Reliable long-range flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in GNSS-denied
environments is challenging: integrating odometry leads to drift, loop closures
are unavailable in previously unseen areas and embedded platforms provide
limited computational power. We present a fully onboard UAV system developed
for the SPRIN-D Funke Fully Autonomous Flight Challenge, which required 9 km
long-range waypoint navigation below 25 m AGL (Above Ground Level) without GNSS
or prior dense mapping. The system integrates perception, mapping, planning,
and control with a lightweight drift-correction method that matches
LiDAR-derived local heightmaps to a prior geo-data heightmap via
gradient-template matching and fuses the evidence with odometry in a clustered
particle filter. Deployed during the competition, the system executed
kilometer-scale flights across urban, forest, and open-field terrain and
reduced drift substantially relative to raw odometry, while running in real
time on CPU-only hardware. We describe the system architecture, the
localization pipeline, and the competition evaluation, and we report practical
insights from field deployment that inform the design of GNSS-denied UAV
autonomy.

TL;DR: 结合MPC和CBF的自适应障碍物表示策略，降低了保守性，实现了狭窄空间实时安全导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主船舶在狭窄内河水道等挑战性空间中的安全运动规划至关重要，但传统方法计算量大或过于保守。

Method: 采用模型预测控制（MPC）和控制屏障函数（CBFs）结合的策略，提出了一种时变膨胀椭圆障碍物表示方法，通过调整膨胀半径以适应船舶与障碍物的相对位置和姿态。

Result: 仿真和实际实验表明，该策略能实时导航全驱动自主机器人船舶通过狭窄空间，并解决潜在死锁，同时确保安全性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的结合MPC和CBF的安全运动规划策略，通过时变膨胀椭圆障碍物表示和自适应膨胀半径，有效降低了控制器的保守性，并在仿真和实际实验中验证了其在狭窄空间实时导航和解决潜在死锁的能力。

Abstract: Safe motion planning is essential for autonomous vessel operations,
especially in challenging spaces such as narrow inland waterways. However,
conventional motion planning approaches are often computationally intensive or
overly conservative. This paper proposes a safe motion planning strategy
combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).
We introduce a time-varying inflated ellipse obstacle representation, where the
inflation radius is adjusted depending on the relative position and attitude
between the vessel and the obstacle. The proposed adaptive inflation reduces
the conservativeness of the controller compared to traditional fixed-ellipsoid
obstacle formulations. The MPC solution provides an approximate motion plan,
and high-order CBFs ensure the vessel's safety using the varying inflation
radius. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed
strategy enables the fully-actuated autonomous robot vessel to navigate through
narrow spaces in real time and resolve potential deadlocks, all while ensuring
safety.

### [137] [A Stochastic Framework for Continuous-Time State Estimation of Continuum Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01381)
*Spencer Teetaert,Sven Lilge,Jessica Burgner-Kahrs,Timothy D. Barfoot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种连续时间随机状态估计框架，适用于连续体机器人，结合简单模型和高频率传感，适应外部干扰和数据丢失，实现高效状态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的连续体机器人状态估计方法存在计算复杂度高、形状近似过于简化或仅限于准静态方法的局限性，且对未建模干扰敏感。

Method: 采用基于连续时间运动学的因子，这些因子受到白噪声高斯过程（GP）的干扰，结合简单的机器人模型和高频率传感。

Result: 该方法能够持续在时间或空间上插值估计机器人的姿态、速度和应变，且由于固有的稀疏性，实现了与时间和插值查询相关的线性求解复杂度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于连续时间随机状态估计的框架，适用于连续体机器人（CRs），能够适应未建模的外部力和数据丢失，提供机器人姿态、速度和应变的均值和协方差估计。

Abstract: State estimation techniques for continuum robots (CRs) typically involve
using computationally complex dynamic models, simplistic shape approximations,
or are limited to quasi-static methods. These limitations can be sensitive to
unmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph
optimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state
estimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on
continuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process
(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show
adaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result
contains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity,
and strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space.
This same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for
inclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated. Our
method's inherent sparsity leads to a linear solve complexity with respect to
time and interpolation queries in constant time. We demonstrate our method on a
CR with gyroscope and pose sensors, highlighting its versatility in real-world
systems.

TL;DR: VENTURA通过视觉计划和行为克隆策略，显著提升了机器人在开放环境中的导航性能，并展现出对未见任务组合的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有视觉语言模型在导航任务中因动作空间和预训练目标差异导致的迁移困难问题，VENTURA旨在通过视觉计划生成和执行策略的结合，提升机器人在开放环境中的导航能力。

Method: VENTURA通过生成图像空间中的路径掩码（视觉计划）来捕获细粒度的导航行为，并利用轻量级的行为克隆策略将这些视觉计划转化为可执行轨迹。训练过程中，使用自监督跟踪模型生成的路径掩码和VLM增强的标注进行监督，避免了手工标注或复杂的数据收集。

Result: 在真实世界评估中，VENTURA在物体到达、障碍物避障和地形偏好任务上优于现有基础模型基线，任务成功率提高了33%，碰撞率降低了54%，并能泛化到未见任务组合。

Conclusion: VENTURA通过微调互联网预训练的图像扩散模型，实现了在视觉语言导航任务中的高效路径规划，显著提升了任务成功率和安全性，并展现出对未见任务组合的泛化能力。

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in
unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)
offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult
to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining
objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing
this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes
internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of
directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a
visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware
navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these
visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows
natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale
training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking
models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level
annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world
evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on
object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving
success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen
scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of
distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities. Videos, code,

### [139] [INSIGHT: INference-time Sequence Introspection for Generating Help Triggers in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01389)
*Ulas Berk Karli,Ziyao Shangguan,Tesca FItzgerald*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: INSIGHT框架利用token级不确定性信号预测VLA何时应请求帮助，通过强/弱监督训练Transformer分类器，结果显示时间动态建模比静态序列级评分更具预测力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管最近的VLA模型表现出强大的泛化能力，但它们缺乏内省机制来预测失败并请求人类监督员的帮助。

Method: 使用π0-FAST作为基础模型，提取每个token的熵、对数概率以及基于Dirichlet的异质性和认知不确定性估计，并训练紧凑的Transformer分类器将这些序列映射到帮助触发信号。

Result: 结果表明，强标签能够捕捉细粒度不确定性动态以实现可靠的帮助检测，而弱标签尽管噪声较大，但在训练和评估对齐时仍支持竞争性内省，为密集标注不可行时提供了可扩展的路径。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统评估了基于不确定性的VLA内省机制，为未来的主动学习和通过选择性人类干预进行实时错误缓解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong generalization
capabilities, yet they lack introspective mechanisms for anticipating failures
and requesting help from a human supervisor. We present \textbf{INSIGHT}, a
learning framework for leveraging token-level uncertainty signals to predict
when a VLA should request help. Using $\pi_0$-FAST as the underlying model, we
extract per-token \emph{entropy}, \emph{log-probability}, and Dirichlet-based
estimates of \emph{aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty}, and train compact
transformer classifiers to map these sequences to help triggers. We explore
supervision regimes for strong or weak supervision, and extensively compare
them across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Our results show a
trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty
dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still
support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned,
offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we
find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals
with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static
sequence-level scores. This study provides the first systematic evaluation of
uncertainty-based introspection in VLAs, opening future avenues for active
learning and for real-time error mitigation through selective human
intervention.

### [140] [Beyond Collision Cones: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Nonholonomic Robots via Dynamic Parabolic Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01402)
*Hun Kuk Park,Taekyung Kim,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出动态抛物线控制屏障函数（DPCBF），解决了非完整机器人在密集动态环境中安全约束过于保守的问题，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于碰撞锥或速度障碍约束的方法在密集动态环境中过于保守，导致二次规划不可行，亟需一种更灵活的安全约束方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种动态抛物线控制屏障函数（DPCBF），通过基于障碍物距离和相对速度大小动态调整抛物线的顶点和曲率，定义了更宽松的安全约束。

Result: 仿真实验表明，DPCBF控制器在密集动态环境中（如100个动态障碍物）的导航成功率和二次规划可行性显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的动态抛物线控制屏障函数（DPCBF）显著提高了非完整机器人在密集动态环境中的导航成功率和二次规划可行性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring the safety
of autonomous systems, yet applying them to nonholonomic robots in cluttered,
dynamic environments remains an open challenge. State-of-the-art methods often
rely on collision-cone or velocity-obstacle constraints which, by only
considering the angle of the relative velocity, are inherently conservative and
can render the CBF-based quadratic program infeasible, particularly in dense
scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Parabolic Control
Barrier Function (DPCBF) that defines the safe set using a parabolic boundary.
The parabola's vertex and curvature dynamically adapt based on both the
distance to an obstacle and the magnitude of the relative velocity, creating a
less restrictive safety constraint. We prove that the proposed DPCBF is valid
for a kinematic bicycle model subject to input constraints. Extensive
comparative simulations demonstrate that our DPCBF-based controller
significantly enhances navigation success rates and QP feasibility compared to
baseline methods. Our approach successfully navigates through dense
environments with up to 100 dynamic obstacles, scenarios where collision
cone-based methods fail due to infeasibility.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 扩散策略在机器人模仿学习中表现良好，但对约束的精确学习受数据集大小和质量影响，流形曲率影响不确定。硬件实验验证了实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散策略在机器人模仿学习中表现优异，但其是否能够精确学习训练数据中的约束尚不明确，因此需要深入研究。

Method: 通过双手机器人拾放任务案例研究，分析扩散策略如何发现约束流形，并考察数据集大小、质量和流形曲率三个因素对训练策略的影响。

Result: 扩散策略能够粗略近似约束流形，但数据集大小和质量的下降会负面影响学习效果。约束流形曲率与约束满足和任务成功之间的相关性不确定。硬件评估验证了结果的现实适用性。

Conclusion: 扩散策略在机器人模仿学习中表现出色，但对于精确学习训练数据中的约束能力，任务性能并非可靠指标。实验表明，数据集大小和质量对策略学习有负面影响，而约束流形曲率的影响则不确定。硬件评估验证了研究结果的现实适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have shown impressive results in robot imitation learning,
even for tasks that require satisfaction of kinematic equality constraints.
However, task performance alone is not a reliable indicator of the policy's
ability to precisely learn constraints in the training data. To investigate, we
analyze how well diffusion policies discover these manifolds with a case study
on a bimanual pick-and-place task that encourages fulfillment of a kinematic
constraint for success. We study how three factors affect trained policies:
dataset size, dataset quality, and manifold curvature. Our experiments show
diffusion policies learn a coarse approximation of the constraint manifold with
learning affected negatively by decreases in both dataset size and quality. On
the other hand, the curvature of the constraint manifold showed inconclusive
correlations with both constraint satisfaction and task success. A hardware
evaluation verifies the applicability of our results in the real world. Project

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AFFORD2ACT通过语义关键点和Transformer策略学习，提升了机器人操作的效率和实时性能，适用于复杂场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于关键点的方法依赖手动启发式或任务耦合选择，限制了可扩展性和语义理解能力。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 可操作性过滤，2) 类别级关键点构建，3) 基于Transformer的策略学习，嵌入门控机制选择最相关关键点。

Result: 在多样化现实世界操作任务中，AFFORD2ACT实现了82%的成功率，且仅需15分钟训练即可生成38维紧凑状态策略。

Conclusion: AFFORD2ACT提出了一个基于语义2D关键点的轻量级框架，通过三阶段流程显著提升了数据效率和实时性能，适用于多样化现实世界操作任务。

Abstract: Vision-based robot learning often relies on dense image or point-cloud
inputs, which are computationally heavy and entangle irrelevant background
features. Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric
features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or
task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To
address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that
distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single
image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering,
category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning
with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a
compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which
performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations.
Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves
data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel
categories, backgrounds, and distractors.

Abstract: Robotic automation is accelerating scientific discovery by reducing manual
effort in laboratory workflows. However, precise manipulation of powders
remains challenging, particularly in tasks such as transport that demand
accuracy and stability. We propose a trajectory optimisation framework for
powder transport in laboratory settings, which integrates differentiable
physics simulation for accurate modelling of granular dynamics, low-dimensional
skill-space parameterisation to reduce optimisation complexity, and a
curriculum-based strategy that progressively refines task competence over long
horizons. This formulation enables end-to-end optimisation of contact-rich
robot trajectories while maintaining stability and convergence efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
task success rates and stability compared to the reinforcement learning
baseline.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种协作机器人引导系统，通过触觉反馈帮助定位肿瘤边界，模拟实验显示其能改善切除效果并降低用户负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保乳手术中，由于肿瘤高度移动、不可触及且边界形状不规则，划定肿瘤边界具有挑战性。为此，研究团队引入了一种应用触觉反馈进行肿瘤定位的协作机器人引导系统。

Method: 一个小型触觉机器人被改装成配备电刀的手术工具，通过超声和电磁导航识别肿瘤边界和位置。当手术工具与肿瘤边界碰撞时，施加禁止区域虚拟固定装置。用户在有和没有触觉引导的情况下对乳腺模拟物进行肿瘤切除，并对结果进行定性和定量评估。

Result: 虚拟固定装置引导改善了切除边缘。平均而言，用户在有触觉反馈时认为任务的心理负担、挫败感和努力程度较低。还发现了一些对手术流程的意外影响，将指导未来的设计调整和培训协议。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，虚拟固定装置在模拟保乳手术中有助于定位肿瘤边界。未来工作将包括广泛的用户研究以进一步验证这些结果并微调引导系统。

Abstract: Purpose: Delineating tumor boundaries during breast-conserving surgery is
challenging as tumors are often highly mobile, non-palpable, and have
irregularly shaped borders. To address these challenges, we introduce a
cooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor
localization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can
be successfully integrated into breast cancer care.
  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to
operate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and
electromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and
position. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool
collides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked
to resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic
guidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On
average, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and
effort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some
unanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments
and training protocol moving forward.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor
boundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery. Future work will include an
extensive user study to further validate these results and fine-tune our
guidance system.

manually annotated questions across 8 diverse trajectories spanning
approximately 100 minutes of video data, enabling fair comparison between
structured approaches and general-purpose VLMs. Real-world deployment on a

Abstract: This work demonstrates pose (position and shape) estimation for a
free-floating, bioinspired multi-link robot with unactuated joints,
link-mounted thrusters for control, and a single gyroscope per link, resulting
in an underactuated, minimally sensed platform. Through a proof-of-concept
hardware experiment and offline Kalman filter analysis, we show that the
robot's pose can be reliably estimated. State estimation is performed using an
unscented Kalman filter augmented with Gaussian process residual learning to
compensate for non-zero-mean, non-Gaussian noise. We further show that a filter
trained on a multi-gait dataset (forward, backward, left, right, and turning)
performs comparably to one trained on a larger forward-gait-only dataset when
both are evaluated on the same forward-gait test trajectory. These results
reveal overlap in the gait input space, which can be exploited to reduce
training data requirements while enhancing the filter's generalizability across
multiple gaits.

Abstract: Robot navigation in large, complex, and unknown indoor environments is a
challenging problem. The existing approaches, such as traditional
sampling-based methods, struggle with resolution control and scalability, while
imitation learning-based methods require a large amount of demonstration data.
Active Neural Time Fields (ANTFields) have recently emerged as a promising
solution by using local observations to learn cost-to-go functions without
relying on demonstrations. Despite their potential, these methods are hampered
by challenges such as spectral bias and catastrophic forgetting, which diminish
their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these issues, our approach
decomposes the planning problem into a hierarchical structure. At the high
level, a sparse graph captures the environment's global connectivity, while at
the low level, a planner based on neural fields navigates local obstacles by
solving the Eikonal PDE. This physics-informed strategy overcomes common
pitfalls like spectral bias and neural field fitting difficulties, resulting in
a smooth and precise representation of the cost landscape. We validate our
framework in large-scale environments, demonstrating its enhanced adaptability
and precision compared to previous methods, and highlighting its potential for
online exploration, mapping, and real-world navigation.

suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot
represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane
segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these
limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based
connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection
and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar
regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and
accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a
resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time
for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged
robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D
planar structures.

Conclusion: MiniBEE系统通过耦合两个低自由度机械臂，实现了全相对定位，同时保持了轻量化和可穿戴性，为双手机器人操作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Bimanual robot manipulators can achieve impressive dexterity, but typically
rely on two full six- or seven- degree-of-freedom arms so that paired grippers
can coordinate effectively. This traditional framework increases system
complexity while only exploiting a fraction of the overall workspace for
dexterous interaction. We introduce the MiniBEE (Miniature Bimanual
End-effector), a compact system in which two reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF
each) are coupled into a kinematic chain that preserves full relative
positioning between grippers. To guide our design, we formulate a kinematic
dexterity metric that enlarges the dexterous workspace while keeping the
mechanism lightweight and wearable. The resulting system supports two
complementary modes: (i) wearable kinesthetic data collection with self-tracked
gripper poses, and (ii) deployment on a standard robot arm, extending dexterity
across its entire workspace. We present kinematic analysis and design
optimization methods for maximizing dexterous range, and demonstrate an
end-to-end pipeline in which wearable demonstrations train imitation learning
policies that perform robust, real-world bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers
in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual
manipulation. ActiveUMI couples a portable VR teleoperation kit with sensorized
controllers that mirror the robot's end-effectors, bridging human-robot
kinematics via precise pose alignment. To ensure mobility and data quality, we
introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a
self-contained wearable computer, and efficient calibration methods.
ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception.
By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted
display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and
manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies
trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\%
on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a
56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our
results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with
learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward
creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.

Conclusion: FailSafe-VLM显著提升了现有VLA模型在机器人操作任务中的性能，并能适应不同空间配置、摄像头视角和机器人形态。

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic manipulation have integrated low-level robotic
control into Vision-Language Models (VLMs), extending them into
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve
strong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale
crowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures
during execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from
unpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing
robotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real
world, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable
to recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure
detection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to
utilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a
novel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces
diverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be
seamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable
creation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune
LLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results
show that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from
potential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA
models pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several
tasks in Maniskill. Furthermore, FailSafe-VLM could generalize across different
spatial configurations, camera viewpoints, and robotic embodiments. We plan to
release the FailSafe code to the community.

TL;DR: 提出一种在线学习测量可靠性的统计框架，通过多视图几何一致性自监督，显著提升视觉-惯性里程计的精度和鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法假设所有测量具有静态、均匀的不确定性，无法捕捉真实世界数据的动态误差特性。

Method: 利用多视图几何一致性作为自监督形式，在线学习传感器数据的可靠性评估，并自适应地调整视觉测量在优化中的权重。

Result: 在EuRoC数据集上，与固定不确定性参数的基线方法相比，平均平移误差减少约24%，旋转误差减少约42%。

Conclusion: 提出的统计框架通过在线学习测量可靠性，显著提高了视觉-惯性里程计的跟踪精度和鲁棒性，且能在实时操作中实现。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robust visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is to
dynamically assess the reliability of sensor measurements. This assessment is
crucial for properly weighting the contribution of each measurement to the
state estimate. Conventional methods often simplify this by assuming a static,
uniform uncertainty for all measurements. This heuristic, however, may be
limited in its ability to capture the dynamic error characteristics inherent in
real-world data. To improve this limitation, we present a statistical framework
that learns measurement reliability assessment online, directly from sensor
data and optimization results. Our approach leverages multi-view geometric
consistency as a form of self-supervision. This enables the system to infer
landmark uncertainty and adaptively weight visual measurements during
optimization. We evaluated our method on the public EuRoC dataset,
demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy with average reductions of
approximately 24\% in translation error and 42\% in rotation error compared to
baseline methods with fixed uncertainty parameters. The resulting framework
operates in real time while showing enhanced accuracy and robustness. To
facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the source code will
be made publicly available.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法（如模仿学习和任务与运动规划）在多步操作中各有不足，SymSkill旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: SymSkill框架离线学习谓词、操作符和技能，并在执行时通过符号规划器组合和重新排序技能以实现目标，同时在运动和符号层面进行实时恢复。

Result: 在RoboCasa模拟中，SymSkill执行12个单步任务的成功率为85%，并能组合成最多6次技能重组的多步计划。在真实机器人上，仅需5分钟的无标记数据即可学习并执行多任务。

Conclusion: SymSkill结合了模仿学习（IL）和任务与运动规划（TAMP）的优势，实现了组合泛化和实时故障恢复，在模拟和真实机器人环境中均表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-step manipulation in dynamic environments remains challenging. Two
major families of methods fail in distinct ways: (i) imitation learning (IL) is
reactive but lacks compositional generalization, as monolithic policies do not
decide which skill to reuse when scenes change; (ii) classical task-and-motion
planning (TAMP) offers compositionality but has prohibitive planning latency,
preventing real-time failure recovery. We introduce SymSkill, a unified
learning framework that combines the benefits of IL and TAMP, allowing
compositional generalization and failure recovery in real-time. Offline,
SymSkill jointly learns predicates, operators, and skills directly from
unlabeled and unsegmented demonstrations. At execution time, upon specifying a
conjunction of one or more learned predicates, SymSkill uses a symbolic planner
to compose and reorder learned skills to achieve the symbolic goals, while
performing recovery at both the motion and symbolic levels in real time.
Coupled with a compliant controller, SymSkill enables safe and uninterrupted
execution under human and environmental disturbances. In RoboCasa simulation,
SymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate. Without
additional data, it composes these skills into multi-step plans requiring up to
6 skill recompositions, recovering robustly from execution failures. On a real
Franka robot, we demonstrate SymSkill, learning from 5 minutes of unsegmented
and unlabeled play data, is capable of performing multiple tasks simply by goal
specifications. The source code and additional analysis can be found on

*Jaewoo Lee,Dongjae Lee,Jinwoo Lee,Hyungyu Lee,Yeonjoon Kim,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A geometric backstepping controller for variable-tilt multirotors, accounting for nonlinear actuator dynamics, shows better stability and performance than linear-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches rely on linear actuator dynamics, which fail to capture nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles, limiting performance during aggressive maneuvers or disturbances. This work addresses this gap.

Method: A geometric backstepping controller is designed, leveraging the cascade structure between rigid-body dynamics and nonlinear actuator dynamics, ensuring exponential stability.

Result: The controller outperformed a baseline in fast translational/rotational tracking and disturbance recovery, maintaining stability where the baseline failed.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric backstepping controller effectively accounts for nonlinear actuator dynamics in variable-tilt omnidirectional multirotors, demonstrating superior stability and performance compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt
omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor
dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and
reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery
from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware
control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on
linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture
the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit
the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its
nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and
establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal
parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we
demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such
uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not
account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast
translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden
disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking
performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the
fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the
proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks,
thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.

Result: 在模拟器间评估中显著减少运动跟踪误差，并在真实机器人上实现零样本部署。

Conclusion: PolySim通过多模拟器联合训练有效减少了模拟器归纳偏差，实现了从模拟到现实的零样本部署。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer
from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive
bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These
biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between
simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive
bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,
encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond
any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training
platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch
parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single
training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.
Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator
inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim
substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for
example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim
baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1
without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to
the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.

Motivation: 现有的Vision-Language-Action (VLA)模型在机器人操作任务中表现不足，因其表征对机器人信号（如控制动作和本体感知状态）不够敏感。

Method: 提出Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL)，一种简单且有效的表征正则化方法，通过利用机器人本体感知状态的相对距离作为软监督，来弥合VLM表征与机器人信号之间的差距。

Result: RS-CL将pick-and-place任务的成功率从30.8%提升至41.5%，并在真实机器人操作任务中将成功率从45.0%提升至58.3%。

Conclusion: 引入Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL)显著提升了VLA模型在机器人操作任务中的表现，证明了其对控制相关表征学习的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot
manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain
suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and
proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware
Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization
for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and
robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely
with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the
states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction
objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning,
while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training
pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves
the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the
prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen,
through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts
success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Magnetic continuum robots (MCRs) enable minimally invasive navigation through
tortuous anatomical channels, yet axially magnetized designs have largely been
limited to bending-only motion. To expand deformation capabilities, this paper
presents a simple assembly that embeds permanent magnets radially within the
catheter wall, allowing a single externally steered permanent magnet to
independently induce either bending or torsion. A physics-based formulation
together with finite-element analysis establishes the actuation principles, and
benchtop experiments validate decoupled mode control under practical fields.
Building on this, a dual-layer blockage mechanism consisting of outer grooves
and inner plates leverages torsional shear to achieve on-demand drug release.
Finally, an in-phantom intervention experiment demonstrates end-to-end
operation: lumen following by bending for target approach, followed by
twist-activated release at the site. The resulting compact, cable-free platform
combines versatile deformation with precise payload delivery, indicating strong
potential for next-generation, site-specific therapies.

Abstract: Modern automated factories increasingly run manufacturing procedures using a
matrix of programmable machines, such as 3D printers, interconnected by a
programmable transport system, such as a fleet of tabletop robots. To embed a
manufacturing procedure into a smart factory, an operator must: (a) assign each
of its processes to a machine and (b) specify how agents should transport parts
between machines. The problem of embedding a manufacturing process into a smart
factory is termed the Smart Factory Embedding (SFE) problem. State-of-the-art
SFE solvers can only scale to factories containing a couple dozen machines.
Modern smart factories, however, may contain hundreds of machines. We fill this
hole by introducing the first highly scalable solution to the SFE, TS-ACES, the
Traffic System based Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver. We show that TS-ACES is
complete and can scale to SFE instances based on real industrial scenarios with
more than a hundred machines.

Conclusion: 结合导航前瞻性和提前退出机制为自动驾驶系统中大型模型的高效部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving
for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders
real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at
intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across
diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous
driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g.,
intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We
propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes
task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on
navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE
achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to
63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates
reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making
in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight
with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large
models in autonomous systems. Code and data are available at our anonymous

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，将模块化RL-based ObjectNav系统分解为感知、策略和测试时增强三个关键组件，并通过控制实验分析各部分的贡献。

Result: 研究发现感知质量和测试时策略是性能的决定性驱动因素，而当前方法的策略改进仅带来边际增益。基于这些发现，提出的增强模块化系统在SPL上超过SotA方法6.6%，成功率提高2.7%。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅设定了ObjectNav的最新性能标准，还为未来的开发和评估提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) is a critical component toward deploying
mobile robots in everyday, uncontrolled environments such as homes, schools,
and workplaces. In this context, a robot must locate target objects in
previously unseen environments using only its onboard perception. Success
requires the integration of semantic understanding, spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon planning, which is a combination that remains extremely
challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant
paradigm, progress has spanned a wide range of design choices, yet the field
still lacks a unifying analysis to determine which components truly drive
performance. In this work, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of modular
RL-based ObjectNav systems, decomposing them into three key components:
perception, policy, and test-time enhancement. Through extensive controlled
experiments, we isolate the contribution of each and uncover clear trends:
perception quality and test-time strategies are decisive drivers of
performance, whereas policy improvements with current methods yield only
marginal gains. Building on these insights, we propose practical design
guidelines and demonstrate an enhanced modular system that surpasses
State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods by 6.6% on SPL and by a 2.7% success rate. We
also introduce a human baseline under identical conditions, where experts
achieve an average 98% success, underscoring the gap between RL agents and
human-level navigation. Our study not only sets the SotA performance but also
provides principled guidance for future ObjectNav development and evaluation.

Abstract: Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in
maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving
precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional
position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches,
exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent
approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated
advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing
progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This
severely constrains the foot's environmental interaction capability, hindering
tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal
trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to
bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot
trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and
acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental
results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking
behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments
confirm the algorithm's efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms,
and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the
soccer goal is within the range of -90{\deg} to 90{\deg}.

Abstract: Simulating greenhouse environments is critical for developing and evaluating
robotic systems for agriculture, yet existing approaches rely on simplistic or
synthetic assets that limit simulation-to-real transfer. Recent advances in
radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic
reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or
controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a
framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly
from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a
ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling
tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82
cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility
for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward
greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future
research in agricultural robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在推理和规划方面的进步，它们为多无人机系统提供了灵活的交互基础，通过直观的语言界面实现高层任务委派。

Conclusion: TACOS框架通过整合自然语言接口、智能协调器和自主代理，成功实现了多无人机系统的高效控制，显著降低了飞行员的工作负担。

Abstract: When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the
task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual
UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for
accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a
framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models
continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural
foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level
task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we
present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified
framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems
through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities
into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for
intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user
intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans
interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library
of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot
coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and
conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.

TL;DR: SPARC是一个紧凑的3自由度脊柱模块，结合了旋转和棱柱运动，通过定制控制器实现了可编程阻抗，实验验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个紧凑、开源的3自由度矢状面脊柱模块，结合旋转（俯仰）和棱柱（轴向）运动，并具有可编程任务空间阻抗，以提升四足机器人的性能。

Method: 开发了一种基于RNEA的计算加速度控制器，结合平滑的Stribeck摩擦补偿，无需显式惯性整形即可实现弹簧-阻尼行为。

Result: 实验验证了该方法的有效性，静态推拉测试显示线性力-位移特性，动态位移释放试验证实了质量-弹簧-阻尼响应。

Conclusion: SPARC为四足机器人提供了一个便携式平台，用于系统性研究脊柱顺应性在步态运动中的作用，并将发布完整的硬件和固件资源。

Abstract: We present SPARC, a compact, open-source 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module
that combines revolute (pitch) and prismatic (axial) motion with programmable
task-space impedance for quadruped robots. The system integrates three
torque-controlled actuators, a custom 1 kHz control board, and a protected
power unit in a 1.26 kg package, enabling closed-loop stiffness and damping
shaping along x, z, and theta. We develop an RNEA-based computed-acceleration
controller with smooth Stribeck friction compensation to render spring-damper
behavior without explicit inertia shaping. Bench experiments validate the
approach. Quasi-static push-pull tests show linear force-displacement
characteristics with commanded horizontal stiffness spanning 300-700 N/m and <=
1.5% relative error (R^2 >= 0.992, narrow 95% CIs). Dynamic
displace-and-release trials confirm mass-spring-damper responses over multiple
damping settings, with small, interpretable phase deviations due to
configuration-dependent inertia and low-speed friction effects. A task-space PD
controller produces roughly linear stiffness but with greater variability and
coupling sensitivity. SPARC provides a portable platform for systematic studies
of spine compliance in legged locomotion and will be released with complete
hardware and firmware resources.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于MPC的运动提示算法，显著减少驾驶模拟器运动病，同时保持运动逼真度，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶模拟器在研究和开发中应用广泛，但常因运动缩放和视觉不匹配导致运动病。本文旨在开发一种算法，既能减少运动病，又能保持运动逼真度。

Method: 采用模型预测控制（MPC）算法，结合主观垂直冲突（SVC）模型，优化运动提示算法，以减少运动病并提升运动逼真度。通过人类在环实验比较了四种模拟器运动设置。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的折中方案将运动病减少了50%以上（平均MISC水平从3降至1.5），且未显著降低运动逼真度评分。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于模型预测控制（MPC）的运动提示算法在减少驾驶模拟器运动病方面取得了显著进展，同时兼顾了运动逼真度和舒适性。

Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development.
However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and
unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is
proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical
conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory
conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing
the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion
settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure
specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and
motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no
motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator
with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model
predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the
lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The
compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5)
compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force
tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the
simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant
advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific
force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目稠密SLAM应用中的高延迟、大GPU内存消耗和对相机校准依赖的问题。

Method: 结合跟踪模块（维护稀疏特征点地图）和基于前馈3D重建模型的映射模块，同时估计相机内参，并融入局部和全局闭环检测。

Conclusion: EC3R-SLAM展示了在资源受限平台上高效运行的潜力，适用于实际机器人应用。

Abstract: The application of monocular dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) is often hindered by high latency, large GPU memory consumption, and
reliance on camera calibration. To relax this constraint, we propose EC3R-SLAM,
a novel calibration-free monocular dense SLAM framework that jointly achieves
high localization and mapping accuracy, low latency, and low GPU memory
consumption. This enables the framework to achieve efficiency through the
coupling of a tracking module, which maintains a sparse map of feature points,
and a mapping module based on a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model that
simultaneously estimates camera intrinsics. In addition, both local and global
loop closures are incorporated to ensure mid-term and long-term data
association, enforcing multi-view consistency and thereby enhancing the overall
accuracy and robustness of the system. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that EC3R-SLAM achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, while being faster and more memory-efficient.
Moreover, it runs effectively even on resource-constrained platforms such as
laptops and Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its potential for real-world robotics
applications.

Conclusion: LangGrasp框架通过结合微调的大型语言模型和点云定位模块，成功解决了模糊指令中的隐含意图问题，显著提升了机器人在非结构化环境中的适应性和任务执行效率。

Abstract: The existing language-driven grasping methods struggle to fully handle
ambiguous instructions containing implicit intents. To tackle this challenge,
we propose LangGrasp, a novel language-interactive robotic grasping framework.
The framework integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to leverage
their robust commonsense understanding and environmental perception
capabilities, thereby deducing implicit intents from linguistic instructions
and clarifying task requirements along with target manipulation objects.
Furthermore, our designed point cloud localization module, guided by 2D part
segmentation, enables partial point cloud localization in scenes, thereby
extending grasping operations from coarse-grained object-level to fine-grained
part-level manipulation. Experimental results show that the LangGrasp framework
accurately resolves implicit intents in ambiguous instructions, identifying
critical operations and target information that are unstated yet essential for
task completion. Additionally, it dynamically selects optimal grasping poses by
integrating environmental information. This enables high-precision grasping
from object-level to part-level manipulation, significantly enhancing the
adaptability and task execution efficiency of robots in unstructured
environments. More information and code are available here:

Conclusion: 本文提出的站立动作通过解决关节位置误差问题，显著提高了NAO机器人的站立成功率，并被其他团队广泛采用。

Abstract: Stand-up motions are an indispensable part of humanoid robot soccer. A robot
incapable of standing up by itself is removed from the game for some time. In
this paper, we present our stand-up motions for the NAO robot. Our approach
dates back to 2019 and has been evaluated and slightly expanded over the past
six years. We claim that the main reason for failed stand-up attempts are large
errors in the executed joint positions. By addressing such problems by either
executing special motions to free up stuck limbs such as the arms, or by
compensating large errors with other joints, we significantly increased the
overall success rate of our stand-up routine. The motions presented in this
paper are also used by several other teams in the Standard Platform League,
which thereby achieve similar success rates, as shown in an analysis of videos
from multiple tournaments.

Abstract: We introduce the soft curvature and spectroscopy (SCANS) system: a versatile,
electronics-free, fluidically actuated soft manipulator capable of assessing
the spectral properties of objects either in hand or through pre-touch caging.
This platform offers a wider spectral sensing capability than previous soft
robotic counterparts. We perform a material analysis to explore optimal soft
substrates for spectral sensing, and evaluate both pre-touch and in-hand
performance. Experiments demonstrate explainable, statistical separation across
diverse object classes and sizes (metal, wood, plastic, organic, paper, foam),
with large spectral angle differences between items. Through linear
discriminant analysis, we show that sensitivity in the near-infrared
wavelengths is critical to distinguishing visually similar objects. These
capabilities advance the potential of optics as a multi-functional sensory
modality for soft robots. The complete parts list, assembly guidelines, and

Conclusion: 数字孪生技术，特别是Bi-PAN模型，能够有效支持电动汽车电池的拆解过程，提高可持续性和生态效益。

Abstract: In the context of the circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase
should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are
crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However,
manufacturers often do not support these processes enough by not sharing
relevant data. This paper proposes use of a digital twin technology, which is
capable to help optimizing the disassembly processes to reduce ecological
impact and enhance sustainability. The proposed approach is demonstrated
through a disassembly use-case of the product digital twin of an electric
vehicle battery. By utilizing product digital twins, challenges associated with
the disassembly of electric vehicle batteries can be solved flexibly and
efficiently for various battery types. As a backbone for the product digital
twin representation, the paper uses the paradigm of product-process-resource
asset networks (PAN). Such networks enable to model relevant relationships
across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific
production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a
product. This paper introduces a Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network
(Bi-PAN) representation, which extends the PAN paradigm to cover not only the
manufacturing, but also the remanufacturing/recycling phase.

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.
Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While
recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they
often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We
develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates
physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic
Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the
Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a
grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework
intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement
rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.
Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating
realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be
publicly available.

Abstract: Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However,
state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their
performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a
photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with
an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks
in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a
Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual
policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its
performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with
distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%
success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under
gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a
quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30
trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.

Result: 实验表明，大多数运动可以被跟踪，但重定向数据中的伪影显著降低策略鲁棒性，尤其是动态或长序列。GMR在跟踪性能和源运动保真度方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: GMR在运动跟踪性能和源运动保真度方面优于现有开源方法，实现了接近闭源基线的感知保真度和策略成功率。

Abstract: Humanoid motion tracking policies are central to building teleoperation
pipelines and hierarchical controllers, yet they face a fundamental challenge:
the embodiment gap between humans and humanoid robots. Current approaches
address this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and
then training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference
trajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot
sliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in
the reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct. While prior work has
demonstrated motion tracking abilities, they often require extensive reward
engineering and domain randomization to succeed. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate how retargeting quality affects policy performance when
excessive reward tuning is suppressed. To address issues that we identify with
existing retargeting methods, we propose a new retargeting method, General
Motion Retargeting (GMR). We evaluate GMR alongside two open-source
retargeters, PHC and ProtoMotions, as well as with a high-quality closed-source
dataset from Unitree. Using BeyondMimic for policy training, we isolate
retargeting effects without reward tuning. Our experiments on a diverse subset
of the LAFAN1 dataset reveal that while most motions can be tracked, artifacts
in retargeted data significantly reduce policy robustness, particularly for
dynamic or long sequences. GMR consistently outperforms existing open-source
methods in both tracking performance and faithfulness to the source motion,
achieving perceptual fidelity and policy success rates close to the
closed-source baseline. Website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有模仿学习策略在视角变化下性能下降的问题，尤其是当策略依赖于静态背景中的视觉线索时。

Method: 使用Plucker嵌入的每像素光线，将相机外参显式地条件化到策略中，并在RoboSuite和ManiSkill中设计了六项任务来评估策略的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，未条件化于相机外参的策略在视角变化时性能下降，而条件化策略则恢复了性能并实现了仅RGB输入的鲁棒控制。

Conclusion: 显式地将策略条件化于相机外参是提升模仿学习视角不变性的有效方法，适用于多种行为克隆策略。

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning
policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we
show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization
across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,
Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic
viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and
ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling
background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without
extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in
fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera
placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields
robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,
and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

Conclusion: ARMADA系统通过FLOAT方法显著减少对人类监督的依赖，提高了策略的成功率和适应性，在多机器人部署和适应任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Imitation learning has shown promise in learning from large-scale real-world
datasets. However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without
sufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail
substantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant
information. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific
data for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer
informative guidance, but usually require full-time human surveillance during
policy rollout. In this work, we devise ARMADA, a multi-robot deployment and
adaptation system with human-in-the-loop shared control, featuring an
autonomous online failure detection method named FLOAT. Thanks to FLOAT, ARMADA
enables paralleled policy rollout and requests human intervention only when
necessary, significantly reducing reliance on human supervision. Hence, ARMADA
enables efficient acquisition of in-domain data, and leads to more scalable
deployment and faster adaptation to new scenarios. We evaluate the performance
of ARMADA on four real-world tasks. FLOAT achieves nearly 95% accuracy on
average, surpassing prior state-of-the-art failure detection approaches by over
20%. Besides, ARMADA manifests more than 4$\times$ increase in success rate and
greater than 2$\times$ reduction in human intervention rate over multiple
rounds of policy rollout and post-training, compared to previous
human-in-the-loop learning methods.

a root, and $k$ terminals, each of which has a monochromatic path to the root.
Our goal is to find an arborescence in which every terminal has a path to the
root, and its path does not switch colors too many times. We give an efficient
algorithm that finds such a solution with at most $2\log_{4/3}k$ color
switches. Up to constant factors this is the best possible universal bound, as
there are graphs requiring at least $\log_2 k$ color switches.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间图实现问题，重点关注路径持续时间、长度和最早到达时间的矩阵。证明了最早到达时间问题在多种设置下可多项式解决，而最短路径问题在非周期性时间图中为NP难。

Motivation: 研究时间图实现问题，给定属性P，确定是否存在具有该属性的时间图。重点关注持续时间、长度或最早到达时间的成对时间路径的矩阵。

Method: 考虑了多种设置，如严格和非严格路径、周期性和非周期性时间图，以及每条边的标签数量限制。对于最早到达时间问题，开发了一种FPT算法。

Result: 对于最早到达时间问题，在周期性和非周期性时间图中，以及严格和非严格路径下，均能实现多项式时间算法。但当矩阵包含多个可能值时，问题变为NP难。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在周期性时间图中，最短路径问题可以在多项式时间内解决，而非周期性版本则变为NP难问题。对于最早到达时间问题，无论是周期性还是非周期性时间图，都能实现多项式时间算法。

Abstract: In this work, we follow the current trend on temporal graph realization,
where one is given a property P and the goal is to determine whether there is a
temporal graph, that is, a graph where the edge set changes over time, with
property P . We consider the problems where as property P , we are given a
prescribed matrix for the duration, length, or earliest arrival time of
pairwise temporal paths. That is, we are given a matrix D and ask whether there
is a temporal graph such that for any ordered pair of vertices (s, t), Ds,t
equals the duration (length, or earliest arrival time, respectively) of any
temporal path from s to t minimizing that specific temporal path metric. For
shortest and earliest arrival temporal paths, we are the first to consider
these problems as far as we know. We analyze these problems for many settings
like: strict and non-strict paths, periodic and non-periodic temporal graphs,
and limited number of labels per edge (that is, limited occurrence number per
edge over time). In contrast to all other path metrics, we show that for the
earliest arrival times, we can achieve polynomial-time algorithms in periodic
and non-periodic temporal graphs and for strict and and non-strict paths.
However, the problem becomes NP-hard when the matrix does not contain a single
integer but a set or range of possible allowed values. As we show, the problem
can still be solved efficiently in this scenario, when the number of entries
with more than one value is small, that is, we develop an FPT-algorithm for the
number of such entries. For the setting of fastest paths, we achieve new
hardness results that answers an open question by Klobas, Mertzios, Molter, and
Spirakis [Theor. Comput. Sci. '25] about the parameterized complexity of the
problem with respect to the vertex cover number and significantly improves over
a previous hardness result for the feedback vertex set number. When considering
shortest paths, we show that the periodic versions are polynomial-time solvable
whereas the non-periodic versions become NP-hard.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的ℓ_p回归求解算法，通过原始-对偶框架简化迭代过程，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的IRLS方法在理论和实际性能之间存在差距，本文旨在通过更简单的迭代方案实现最优的迭代复杂度。

Method: 采用原始-对偶框架，通过维护对偶目标的不变性自然推导更新规则，实现了高效的迭代重加权最小二乘法（IRLS）。

Result: 新算法在迭代复杂度上达到最新水平，显著优于Adil-Peng-Sachdeva的IRLS算法和MATLAB/CVX实现。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入一种基于原始-对偶框架的轻量级迭代方案，显著提升了ℓ_p回归问题的求解效率，填补了理论与实际算法之间的差距。

Abstract: We introduce fast algorithms for solving $\ell_{p}$ regression problems using
the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art iteration complexity, outperforming the IRLS algorithm by
Adil-Peng-Sachdeva (NeurIPS 2019) and matching the theoretical bounds
established by the complex algorithm of Adil-Kyng-Peng-Sachdeva (SODA 2019, J.
ACM 2024) via a simpler lightweight iterative scheme. This bridges the existing
gap between theoretical and practical algorithms for $\ell_{p}$ regression. Our
algorithms depart from prior approaches, using a primal-dual framework, in
which the update rule can be naturally derived from an invariant maintained for
the dual objective. Empirically, we show that our algorithms significantly
outperform both the IRLS algorithm by Adil-Peng-Sachdeva and MATLAB/CVX
implementations.

Abstract: Circuit augmentation schemes are a family of combinatorial algorithms for
linear programming that generalize the simplex method. To solve the linear
program, they construct a so-called monotone circuit walk: They start at an
initial vertex of the feasible region and traverse a discrete sequence of
points on the boundary, while moving along certain allowed directions
(circuits) and improving the objective function at each step until reaching an
optimum. Since the existence of short circuit walks has been conjectured
(Circuit Diameter Conjecture), several works have investigated how well one can
efficiently approximate shortest monotone circuit walks towards an optimum. A
first result addressing this question was given by De Loera, Kafer, and
Sanit\`a [SIAM J. Opt., 2022], who showed that given as input an LP and the
starting vertex, finding a $2$-approximation for this problem is NP-hard.
Cardinal and the third author [Math. Prog. 2023] gave a stronger lower bound
assuming the exponential time hypothesis, showing that even an approximation
factor of $O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$ is intractable for LPs defined by $m$
inequalities. Both of these results were based on reductions from highly
degenerate polytopes in combinatorial optimization with high dimension.
  In this paper, we significantly strengthen the aforementioned hardness
results by showing that for every fixed $\varepsilon>0$ approximating the
problem on polygons with $m$ edges to within a factor of $O(m^{1-\varepsilon})$
is NP-hard. This result is essentially best-possible, as it cannot be improved
beyond $o(m)$. In particular, this implies hardness for simple polytopes and in
fixed dimension.

Result: 在5G网络中，MMGaP显著提升了上下行吞吐量（上行约50 Mbps/用户，下行100 Mbps/用户），并支持更大的MIMO规模（16天线与16用户）。

Abstract: Physics-inspired and quantum compute based methods for processing in the
physical layer of next-generation cellular radio access networks have
demonstrated theoretical advances in spectral efficiency in recent years, but
have stopped short of practical realization on commodity processors, leaving a
gap between the throughput practical systems can achieve and the projected
throughput the state-of-the-art should achieve. To fill this gap, this paper
proposes MMGaP, an uplink multi-user MIMO detector and downlink Vector
perturbation precoder for next-generation cellular networks. MMGaP realizes
these large MIMO processing algorithms for the first time on bare-metal CUDA
kernels that scale to run on large GPU processing platforms, and can be
packaged as TensorFlow modules, allowing easy integration with a variety of
systems. We integrate MMGaP with NVIDIA's software-defined, GPU-accelerated 5G
platform and evaluate its performance against the state-of-the-art. In a 5G
cellular network using 100 MHz of radio bandwidth, eight antennas at the base
station and eight concurrent users, we show that MMGaP improves uplink
throughput by approximately 50 Mbps per user and downlink throughput by 100
Mbps per user over a wide range of SNR. We further show that MMGaP can also
support larger MIMO sizes: for 16 antennas at the base station and 16
concurrent users, MMGaP provides more than 50 Mbps higher uplink throughput per
user. We measure the execution time of MMGaP on different NVIDIA GPUs and show
that it can operate at line-rate and meet the timing requirements of
state-of-the-art 5G systems.

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OST-AR深度感知依赖视觉覆盖可能分散注意力，且在遮挡或光照不足时效果受限。结合手腕触觉反馈可弥补这些不足。

Method: 设计了一个带有六个振动马达的自定义腕带，提供方向和状态提示，并将其与手持工具和OST-AR集成，通过形成性研究和两个实验（N=21和N=27）评估其效果。

Result: 实验表明，参与者在认知负荷下能准确识别触觉模式，且多模态反馈在空间精度和可用性上优于纯视觉或纯触觉条件。

Conclusion: 结合手腕触觉反馈的光学透视增强现实（OST-AR）在空间精度和可用性上优于纯视觉或纯触觉条件，证明了多模态反馈在深度引导任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and
annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on
tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth
perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly
affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument
reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair
performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and
leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers
perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that
combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have
seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated
skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind
users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal
audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn
feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of
longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors
found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.
These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on
wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors
delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and
OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a
formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants
accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal
feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or
haptic-only conditions.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the
confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and
claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete
scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety
Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to
prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless
augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work
by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system
architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We
also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within
hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves
sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching
environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法资源分配均匀，无法在感兴趣区域（ROIs）实现高细节，且模型体积过大。

Method: 提出了ROI-GS框架，包括对象引导的相机选择、针对性的对象训练以及高保真对象重建与全局场景的无缝集成。

Result: 实验显示ROI-GS在局部质量上提升高达2.96 dB PSNR，模型大小减少约17%，训练速度更快。

Conclusion: ROI-GS通过对象感知框架显著提升了3D场景重建的局部细节质量，同时减少了模型大小并加速了训练过程，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合微表面BRDF和高斯泼溅的可重新光照框架，通过优化环境贴图和扩散先验实现高质量材质重建和真实重新光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确重建和重新光照高光物体是一个长期存在的挑战，因为物体形状、材质属性和光照难以分离。现有神经渲染方法通常依赖简化的BRDF模型或耦合漫反射和高光组件的参数化，限制了材质恢复的忠实度和重新光照的保真度。

Method: 提出了一个可重新光照的框架，将微表面BRDF与高光-光泽参数化集成到2D高斯泼溅中，采用延迟着色。通过基于扩散的表面法线和漫反射颜色先验指导早期优化，减少模糊性。环境贴图的从粗到细优化加速收敛并保留高动态范围镜面反射。

Result: 在复杂、高光场景上的大量实验表明，该方法在几何和材质重建方面表现出色，在新光照条件下提供了更真实、一致的重新光照效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂、高光场景中实现了高质量的几何和材质重建，相比现有高斯泼溅方法，在新光照条件下提供了更真实、一致的重新光照效果。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

TL;DR: PerfOrch是一种多阶段LLM编排框架，通过动态路由和验证机制显著提升代码生成性能，实证结果显示其在正确性和运行时效率上均优于单一模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单一模型的方法忽略了不同LLM在编程语言、算法领域和开发阶段上的异构计算优势，本文旨在挑战这一传统，提出一种更高效的编排框架。

Method: 本文提出了一种多阶段、性能导向的编排框架PerfOrch，通过动态路由任务至最合适的LLM，并结合生成-修复-优化工作流。该方法基于对17种先进LLM在五种编程语言上的实证研究，使用HumanEval-X和EffiBench-X基准测试进行评估。

Result: PerfOrch在不需微调的情况下，显著优于单一模型基线，平均正确率分别达到96.22%（HumanEval-X）和91.37%（EffiBench-X），并优化了58.76%问题的执行时间，中位数加速范围为17.67%至27.66%。

Conclusion: PerfOrch框架通过动态路由和多阶段验证机制，显著提升了代码生成的正确性和运行时性能，为生产级自动化软件工程提供了一种适应性强的范式。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for
automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore
the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across
programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. This paper
challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage,
performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks
to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our
approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art
LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using
HumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness
and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization,
and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language,
development stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we
present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each
task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without
requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over
strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37%
on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and
49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance
optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median
speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The
framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing
new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm
for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly
evolving generative AI landscape.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores the 'wontfix' label in GitHub, finding it used in 30% of projects, mainly for user-submitted issues. Eight themes explain its use, highlighting its role in resource management but potential to discourage community involvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'wontfix' label is widely used in GitHub repositories but its impact on project management and community dynamics is not clearly defined. This study aims to examine its prevalence and reasons across various open-source repositories.

Method: Employing a mixed-method approach, the study analyzed quantitative data to assess the prevalence of the 'wontfix' label and qualitative data to explore its reasoning. Data were collected from 3,132 of GitHub's most-popular repositories, followed by open coding and thematic analysis to categorize the reasons behind 'wontfix' labels.

Result: Findings show that about 30% of projects on GitHub apply the 'wontfix' label, primarily to user-submitted issues like bug reports and feature requests. Eight common themes behind its use were identified, ranging from user-specific control factors to maintainer-specific decisions.

Conclusion: The 'wontfix' label is a critical tool for managing resources and guiding contributor efforts in GitHub projects, but it can also discourage community involvement and obscure project management transparency. Understanding its reasons helps project managers make informed decisions and foster efficient collaboration.

Abstract: Context: The ``wontfix'' label is a widely used yet narrowly understood tool
in GitHub repositories, indicating that an issue will not be pursued further.
Despite its prevalence, the impact of this label on project management and
community dynamics within open-source software development is not clearly
defined. Objective: This study examines the prevalence and reasons behind
issues being labeled as wontfix across various open-source repositories on
GitHub. Method: Employing a mixed-method approach, we analyze both quantitative
data to assess the prevalence of the wontfix label and qualitative data to
explore the reasoning that it was used. Data were collected from 3,132 of
GitHub's most-popular repositories. Later, we employ open coding and thematic
analysis to categorize the reasons behind wontfix labels, providing a
structured understanding of the issue management landscape. Results: Our
findings show that about 30% of projects on GitHub apply the wontfix label to
some issues. These issues most often occur on user-submitted issues for bug
reports and feature requests. The study identified eight common themes behind
labeling issues as wontfix, ranging from user-specific control factors to
maintainer-specific decisions. Conclusions: The wontfix label is a critical
tool for managing resources and guiding contributor efforts in GitHub projects.
However, it can also discourage community involvement and obscure the
transparency of project management. Understanding these reasons aids project
managers in making informed decisions and fostering efficient collaboration
within open-source communities.

Conclusion: MIMIC框架通过模拟不同玩家的游戏策略，显著提高了游戏测试的覆盖率和多样性，展现了其在游戏测试中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modern video games pose significant challenges for traditional automated
testing algorithms, yet intensive testing is crucial to ensure game quality. To
address these challenges, researchers designed gaming agents using
Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, or Large Language Models. However,
these agents often neglect the diverse strategies employed by human players due
to their different personalities, resulting in repetitive solutions in similar
situations. Without mimicking varied gaming strategies, these agents struggle
to trigger diverse in-game interactions or uncover edge cases.
  In this paper, we present MIMIC, a novel framework that integrates diverse
personality traits into gaming agents, enabling them to adopt different gaming
strategies for similar situations. By mimicking different playstyles, MIMIC can
achieve higher test coverage and richer in-game interactions across different
games. It also outperforms state-of-the-art agents in Minecraft by achieving a
higher task completion rate and providing more diverse solutions. These results
highlight MIMIC's significant potential for effective game testing.

issues arising from incompatibilities among licenses may lead to legal
disputes. At the same time, the blockchain technology with immutable entries
offers a mechanism to provide transparency when it comes to licensing and
ensure software changes are recorded. In this work, we are introducing an
integration of blockchain and license management when creating derivative
works, in order to tackle the issue of OSS license compatibility. We have
designed, implemented and performed a preliminary evaluation of FOSS-chain, a
web platform that uses blockchain and automates the license compliance process,
covering 14 OSS licenses. We have evaluated the initial prototype version of
the FOSS-chain platform via a small scale user study. Our preliminary results
are promising, demonstrating the potential of the platform for adaptation on
realistic software systems.

### [190] [ARENA: A tool for measuring and analysing the energy efficiency of Android apps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01754)
*Hina Anwar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ARENA是一款IDE插件，简化了Android应用硬件能耗测量流程，支持数据分析和可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有硬件能耗测量方法耗时且不易适配或复现，缺乏开源工具支持开发者和研究者进行可靠测量。

Method: ARENA通过执行测试场景计算Android智能手机的能耗，并作为IntelliJ和Android Studio插件实现。

Result: ARENA实现了在IDE内直接连接硬件设备进行能耗测量，并提供数据分析和可视化功能。

Conclusion: ARENA是一款支持开发者在不离开IDE的情况下连接物理测量设备的工具，帮助开发者比较不同应用或同一应用不同版本的能耗，并进行数据聚合、统计分析和可视化。

Abstract: To build energy-efficient apps, there is a need to estimate and analyze their
energy consumption in typical usage scenarios. The energy consumption of
Android apps could be estimated via software-based and hardware-based
approaches. Software-based approaches, while easier to implement, are not as
accurate as hardware-based approaches. The process of measuring the energy
consumption of an Android app via a hardware-based approach typically involves
1) setting up a measurement environment, 2) executing the app under test on a
mobile device, 3) recording current/voltage data via a hardware device to
measure energy consumption, and 4) cleaning and aggregating data for analyses,
reports, and visualizations. Specialized scripts are written for selected
hardware and software components to ensure reliable energy measurements. The
energy measurement process is repeated many times and aggregated to remove
noise. These steps make the hardware-based energy measurement process
time-consuming and not easy to adapt or reproduce. There is a lack of
open-source tools available for developers and researchers to take reliable
energy measurements via hardware devices. In this paper, we present and
demonstrate ARENA, a support tool that enables developers and researchers to
connect to a physical measurement device without leaving the comfort of their
IDE. Developers could use ARENA during development to compare energy
consumption between different apps or versions of the same app. ARENA
calculates energy consumption on an Android smartphone by executing a test
scenario on the app under development. Further, ARENA helps aggregate,
statistically analyze, report, and visualize the data, allowing developers and
researchers to dig into the data directly or visually. We implemented ARENA as
an IntelliJ and Android Studio plugin.

### [191] [Towards Speeding up Program Repair with Non-Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01825)
*Zhenyu Yang,Yue Pan,Zhen Yang,Zhongxing Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NARRepair是首个针对APR任务定制的NAR代码生成模型，显著提升修复速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统AR-based APR技术因逐令牌生成导致的巨大时间延迟问题，特别是在参数较多的模型中更为严重。

Method: 提出了NARRepair模型，包含修复动作预测器、令牌间依赖提取器和两阶段解码器三大创新点，以解决NAR方式在APR任务中的问题。

Result: NARRepair在有限修复时间内表现最佳，修复速度在GPU环境下提高了1.4-6.4倍。

Conclusion: NARRepair在修复速度和准确性方面达到了最先进的综合性能，显著提升了自动程序修复的效率。

Abstract: Enlightened by the success of machine learning techniques in various
application areas, recent years have witnessed a surge of research efforts on
automatic program repair (APR) using machine learning techniques. Previous
machine learning-based APR techniques essentially modified bugs in the
autoregressive (AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values.
Due to the manner of token-by-token generation, the AR-based APR technique has
a huge time delay. In particular, the delay of the APR model with a large
number of parameters is more serious. To address the issue, we aim to apply the
non-autoregressive (NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code
in a parallel manner to avoid huge repair delays. However, the naive use of the
NAR manner for the APR task suffers from the issue of compromised patch
quality. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper
propose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR
task. The NARRepair model features three major novelties, including 1) the
repair action predictor for alleviating the over-correction issue, 2) the
inter-token dependency extractor for alleviating the issue of lacking
inter-token dependency information, and 3) the two-stage decoder for
alleviating the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair
on three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that
1) compared to other APR techniques, the NARRepair model has the best
performance within the limited repair time, and 2) compared to AR-based APR
techniques, the repair speed of NARRepair has been increased by 1.4-6.4 times
in the GPU environment. Overall, the results show that NARRepair has achieved
state-of-the-art comprehensive performance in terms of repair speed and
accuracy.

*Victor Lira,Paulo Borba,Rodrigo Bonifácio,Galileu Santos e Matheus barbosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RefFilter是一种重构感知的语义干扰检测工具，通过过滤行为保持的重构减少误报，实验证明其有效且实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前轻量级静态分析技术在协作软件开发中检测语义干扰时存在高误报率，主要原因是无法有效区分行为保持的代码重构和行为影响的变化。

Method: RefFilter基于现有的静态分析技术，通过集成自动化重构检测来改进精确度，过滤掉行为保持的重构，从而减少误报。

Result: 实验结果显示，RefFilter在标记数据集上减少了近32%的误报，尽管假阴性略有增加，但精确度的整体提升明显超过了召回率的微小损失。

Conclusion: RefFilter通过结合自动化重构检测，显著减少了语义干扰检测中的误报，提高了精确度，同时保持了检测覆盖率。实验证明，这种重构感知的干扰检测策略在现代开发工作流程中是实用且有效的。

Abstract: Detecting semantic interference remains a challenge in collaborative software
development. Recent lightweight static analysis techniques improve efficiency
over SDG-based methods, but they still suffer from a high rate of false
positives. A key cause of these false positives is the presence of
behavior-preserving code refactorings, which current techniques cannot
effectively distinguish from changes that impact behavior and can interfere
with others. To handle this problem we present RefFilter, a refactoring-aware
tool for semantic interference detection. It builds on existing static
techniques by incorporating automated refactoring detection to improve
precision. RefFilter discards behavior-preserving refactorings from reports,
reducing false positives while preserving detection coverage. To evaluate
effectiveness and scalability, use two datasets: a labeled dataset with 99
scenarios and ground truth, and a novel dataset of 1,087 diverse merge
scenarios that we have built. Experimental results show that RefFilter reduces
false positives by nearly 32% on the labeled dataset. While this reduction
comes with a non significant increase in false negatives, the overall gain in
precision significantly outweighs the minor trade-off in recall. These findings
demonstrate that refactoring-aware interference detection is a practical and
effective strategy for improving merge support in modern development workflows.

TL;DR: CLAST通过程序分析和LLM重写改进单元测试的语义清晰度，显著提升测试生成效果，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于上下文学习的单元测试生成方法受示例质量影响较大，语义不清晰的示例会导致生成效果不佳。

Method: CLAST结合程序分析和基于LLM的重写技术，将复杂的测试分解为逻辑更清晰的测试。

Result: CLAST在四个开源和三个工业项目中评估，优于现有技术UTgen，保持了测试有效性并显著提升了语义清晰度。用户研究中超过85.33%的参与者偏好CLAST改进的测试。

Conclusion: CLAST通过系统性地改进单元测试的语义清晰度，显著提升了其作为上下文示例的效用，并在实际项目和用户研究中表现出优于现有技术的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled promising
performance in unit test generation through in-context learning (ICL). However,
the quality of in-context examples significantly influences the effectiveness
of generated tests-poorly structured or semantically unclear test examples
often lead to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose CLAST, a novel
technique that systematically refines unit tests to improve their semantic
clarity, thereby enhancing their utility as in-context examples. The approach
decomposes complex tests into logically clearer ones and improves semantic
clarity through a combination of program analysis and LLM-based rewriting. We
evaluated CLAST on four open-source and three industrial projects. The results
demonstrate that CLAST largely outperforms UTgen, the state-of-the-art
refinement technique, in both preserving test effectiveness and enhancing
semantic clarity. Specifically, CLAST fully retains the original effectiveness
of unit tests, while UTgen reduces compilation success rate (CSR), pass rate
(PR), test coverage (Cov), and mutation score (MS) by an average of 12.90%,
35.82%, 4.65%, and 5.07%, respectively. Over 85.33% of participants in our user
study preferred the semantic clarity of CLAST-refined tests. Notably,
incorporating CLAST-refined tests as examples effectively improves ICL-based
unit test generation approaches such as RAGGen and TELPA, resulting in an
average increase of 25.97% in CSR, 28.22% in PR, and 45.99% in Cov for
generated tests, compared to incorporating UTgen-refined tests. The insights
from the follow-up user study not only reinforce CLAST's potential impact in
software testing practice but also illuminate avenues for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在上下文因素变化时，如何最小化对原始解决方案的修改并确保新解决方案的最优性。

Method: 利用声明性建模语言和模型转换技术，对组合重优化问题进行了分类，并提出了相应的重优化策略。

Result: 通过GIPS工具应用于教学助理分配问题，验证了方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于模型驱动工程（MDE）的方法，用于系统地推导重优化问题，并通过GIPS工具实现了初步概念验证。

Abstract: Once an optimisation problem has been solved, the solution may need
adaptation when contextual factors change. This challenge, also known as
reoptimisation, has been addressed in various problem domains, such as railway
crew rescheduling, nurse rerostering, or aircraft recovery. This requires a
modified problem to be solved again to ensure that the adapted solution is
optimal in the new context. However, the new optimisation problem differs
notably from the original problem: (i) we want to make only minimal changes to
the original solution to minimise the impact; (ii) we may be unable to change
some parts of the original solution (e.g., because they refer to past
allocations); and (iii) we need to derive a change script from the original
solution to the new solution. In this paper, we argue that Model-Driven
Engineering (MDE) - in particular, the use of declarative modelling languages
and model transformations for the high-level specification of optimisation
problems - offers new opportunities for the systematic derivation of
reoptimisation problems from the original optimisation problem specification.
We focus on combinatorial reoptimisation problems and provide an initial
categorisation of changing problems and strategies for deriving the
corresponding reoptimisation specifications. We introduce an initial
proof-of-concept implementation based on the GIPS (Graph-Based (Mixed) Integer
Linear Programming Problem Specification) tool and apply it to an example
resource-allocation problem: the allocation of teaching assistants to teaching
sessions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程实证研究领域虽已成熟，但仍面临研究可重复性、外部有效性不足、评审主观性等问题，且许多研究细节未明确记录，对新人不够友好。

Method: 通过专家访谈、焦点小组、调查和立场文章等多种方法收集和讨论化内容。

Result: 推出了新的ACM SIGSOFT SEN专栏（SEN-ESE），旨在讨论ESE研究的元问题，激发社区对话，改进研究实践。

Conclusion: 该专栏旨在为软件工程实证研究（ESE）提供一个讨论平台，促进对研究方法的反思和改进，并鼓励社区参与和贡献。

Abstract: From its early foundations in the 1970s, empirical software engineering (ESE)
has evolved into a mature research discipline that embraces a plethora of
different topics, methodologies, and industrial practices. Despite its
remarkable progress, the ESE research field still needs to keep evolving, as
new impediments, shortcoming, and technologies emerge. Research
reproducibility, limited external validity, subjectivity of reviews, and
porting research results to industrial practices are just some examples of the
drivers for improvements to ESE research. Additionally, several facets of ESE
research are not documented very explicitly, which makes it difficult for
newcomers to pick them up. With this new regular ACM SIGSOFT SEN column
(SEN-ESE), we introduce a venue for discussing meta-aspects of ESE research,
ranging from general topics such as the nature and best practices for
replication packages, to more nuanced themes such as statistical methods,
interview transcription tools, and publishing interdisciplinary research. Our
aim for the column is to be a place where we can regularly spark conversations
on ESE topics that might not often be touched upon or are left implicit.
Contributions to this column will be grounded in expert interviews, focus
groups, surveys, and position pieces, with the goal of encouraging reflection
and improvement in how we conduct, communicate, teach, and ultimately improve
ESE research. Finally, we invite feedback from the ESE community on
challenging, controversial, or underexplored topics, as well as suggestions for
voices you would like to hear from. While we cannot promise to act on every
idea, we aim to shape this column around the community interests and are
grateful for all contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决公共交通中欺诈和逃票问题，利用CCTV和音频数据开发一个高效的多模态检测系统。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer for Video (ViViT)模型进行视频特征提取，Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)进行音频分析，并通过Tensor Fusion Network (TFN)架构显式建模单模态和双模态交互。

Result: 系统在自定义数据集上实现了89.5%的准确率、87.2%的精确率和84.0%的召回率，显著优于早期融合基线和现有技术。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多模态系统通过结合视觉和音频分析，显著提高了公共交通欺诈和逃票检测的准确性和召回率，支持实时检测，有助于减少收入损失并提升乘客安全。

Abstract: This research introduces a multimodal system designed to detect fraud and
fare evasion in public transportation by analyzing closed circuit television
(CCTV) and audio data. The proposed solution uses the Vision Transformer for
Video (ViViT) model for video feature extraction and the Audio Spectrogram
Transformer (AST) for audio analysis. The system implements a Tensor Fusion
Network (TFN) architecture that explicitly models unimodal and bimodal
interactions through a 2-fold Cartesian product. This advanced fusion technique
captures complex cross-modal dynamics between visual behaviors (e.g.,
tailgating,unauthorized access) and audio cues (e.g., fare transaction sounds).
The system was trained and tested on a custom dataset, achieving an accuracy of
89.5%, precision of 87.2%, and recall of 84.0% in detecting fraudulent
activities, significantly outperforming early fusion baselines and exceeding
the 75% recall rates typically reported in state-of-the-art transportation
fraud detection systems. Our ablation studies demonstrate that the tensor
fusion approach provides a 7.0% improvement in the F1 score and an 8.8% boost
in recall compared to traditional concatenation methods. The solution supports
real-time detection, enabling public transport operators to reduce revenue
loss, improve passenger safety, and ensure operational compliance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的公共代码数据集缺乏可验证的质量保证，静态的“数据集卡片”既不可审计也不提供统计保证，导致团队需要构建孤立的临时清理管道，增加了成本和努力分散。

Method: 提出了SIEVE框架，将针对每个属性的检查转化为可机器读取、可验证的置信卡（Confidence Cards），并附带随时有效的统计界限。

Result: SIEVE框架通过社区驱动的方式，提供了可验证的统计保证，有望降低质量保证成本并增强对代码数据集的信任。

Conclusion: SIEVE框架通过社区驱动的方式，以可验证的统计保证取代传统的静态数据集卡片，预计将降低质量保证成本并增强对代码数据集的信任。

Abstract: Code agents and empirical software engineering rely on public code datasets,
yet these datasets lack verifiable quality guarantees. Static 'dataset cards'
inform, but they are neither auditable nor do they offer statistical
guarantees, making it difficult to attest to dataset quality. Teams build
isolated, ad-hoc cleaning pipelines. This fragments effort and raises cost. We
present SIEVE, a community-driven framework. It turns per-property checks into
Confidence Cards-machine-readable, verifiable certificates with anytime-valid
statistical bounds. We outline a research plan to bring SIEVE to maturity,
replacing narrative cards with anytime-verifiable certification. This shift is
expected to lower quality-assurance costs and increase trust in code-datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件与AI技术的集成增加了软件供应链的复杂性，现有SBOM框架无法满足AI系统的动态性和数据驱动特性。

Method: 引入Trusted AI Bill of Materials (TAIBOM)框架，扩展SBOM原则至AI领域，包括结构化依赖模型、完整性声明传播机制和信任认证过程。

Result: TAIBOM在AI工作流中支持保证、安全性和合规性，优于现有标准如SPDX和CycloneDX。

Conclusion: TAIBOM框架为AI系统提供了可信赖和可验证的基础，通过结构化的软件透明度增强了依赖管理、完整性和合规性。

Abstract: The growing integration of open-source software and AI-driven technologies
has introduced new layers of complexity into the software supply chain,
challenging existing methods for dependency management and system assurance.
While Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become critical for enhancing
transparency and traceability, current frameworks fall short in capturing the
unique characteristics of AI systems -- namely, their dynamic, data-driven
nature and the loosely coupled dependencies across datasets, models, and
software components. These challenges are compounded by fragmented governance
structures and the lack of robust tools for ensuring integrity, trust, and
compliance in AI-enabled environments.
  In this paper, we introduce Trusted AI Bill of Materials (TAIBOM) -- a novel
framework extending SBOM principles to the AI domain. TAIBOM provides (i) a
structured dependency model tailored for AI components, (ii) mechanisms for
propagating integrity statements across heterogeneous AI pipelines, and (iii) a
trust attestation process for verifying component provenance. We demonstrate
how TAIBOM supports assurance, security, and compliance across AI workflows,
highlighting its advantages over existing standards such as SPDX and CycloneDX.
This work lays the foundation for trustworthy and verifiable AI systems through
structured software transparency.

Conclusion: 本文展示了将AI集成到大规模模糊测试流水线中的前景与挑战，通过两种AI驱动策略显著减少了虚假崩溃报告。

Abstract: Fuzz testing has become a cornerstone technique for identifying software bugs
and security vulnerabilities, with broad adoption in both industry and
open-source communities. Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers,
which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target
function. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz
drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models
to automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers
frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly
structured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially
crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as
reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system
and the team.
  This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in
OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First,
constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a
function's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based
crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether
reported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark
functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes
by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that
frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents. Our results
highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing
pipelines.
