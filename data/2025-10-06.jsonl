Existing\nstrategies fall short: horizontal scaling provisions entire replicas of the\ncurrent configuration, often tens to hundreds of accelerators, leading to\ncoarse granularity, long provisioning delays, and costly overprovisioning.\nVertical scaling offers finer adjustments but typically requires instance\nrestarts, incurring downtime. These limitations make current approaches\nill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud\ndeployments.\n  We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that\nachieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling. ElasticMoE\ndecouples inference execution from memory operations, enabling scaling steps to\nproceed concurrently with serving. An HBM Management Module (HMM) reuses\nweights and KV caches via zero-copy remapping, while high-bandwidth\npeer-to-peer transfers bring newly added accelerators online without\ninterrupting service. A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism\nmigrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory\nusage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.\n  Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that\nElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput\nduring scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to\nbaselines. By enabling fine-grained, concurrent scaling with minimal\ndisruption, ElasticMoE advances the practicality of deploying massive MoE LLMs\nin dynamic cloud environments."}

In this setting, speculative decoding can\nfacilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an\non-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target\nmodel verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike\nautoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for\nembodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot\nparallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action\ndepends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action.

Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection\nprobability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the\npath deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference\nperformance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid\ninference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while\nlowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without\nskipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model\nonly inference."}

To\naddress this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental\nfeatures of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent\nand single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL\nalgorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying\ncomplexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing\ncomplexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem\nformulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for\nCSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus\noffering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime\nlogistics."}

We argue that code communicates\nthrough two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and\nhuman-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel\nseverely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models\nregress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent\nreductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing\nthat current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than\ngenuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite\nof semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier\nleakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we\nrelease ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically\nsuppresses naming cues while preserving behavior.

At the\nsame time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally\nblack-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly\nlimiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim\nto overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision\nprocess. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and\nscientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their\nassumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different\nconceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an\nexplanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or\nrelative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical\ndebate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into\ndifferent XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the\nvalidity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We\ninvestigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability\nmethods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make\nabout the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about\nthose explanations.

To address this challenge, we turn to\nrepresentation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing\nfeatures from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target\nthe representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,\ndetector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we\ndefine modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging\nmodality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate\nthe modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context\nAttention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to\npropagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style\narchitectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into\nobject queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that\naligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific\ncontrastive objective with modality-balanced batches.

We\nintroduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug\nabstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the\nagentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that\nare unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug.

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks."}

We propose GeoComplete,\na novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce\ngeometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior\nimage-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud.

We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can\nautonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual\nplanning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A\nSimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and\na GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the\nPDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of\ngeneralizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the\ndifferent instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different\nproblems with varied appearances and rules.

However,\noptical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly\nmodeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires\nintelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage\nthe intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse\nnavigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.\nSpecifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360\nobservations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation\nmodels. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three\nreinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information\nin three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation\ncapabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA\nmodel using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is\ndynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through\nextensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model\nachieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student\nVLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of\nintegrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further\nconfirm the effectiveness of our method."}
