### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Oracle-RLAIF通过AI反馈和排序优化，显著降低了视频语言模型微调成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模的增大，传统基于人类反馈的强化学习成本高昂且效率低下，亟需一种更经济高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出了Oracle-RLAIF框架，利用通用Oracle排序器替代传统训练的奖励模型，并引入了基于排序的损失函数$GRPO_{rank}$，直接优化序数反馈。

Result: 实验表明，Oracle-RLAIF在多个视频理解基准测试中均优于现有微调方法。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF提出了一种更灵活、数据高效的大型多模态视频模型对齐框架，通过基于排序的强化学习替代传统的评分方法，显著提升了视频理解性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [3] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)
*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHMR通过视觉到动作策略学习框架，直接从视频中重建物理合理的人类运动，结合pixel-as-ray策略和知识蒸馏，显著提升质量和真实性。

Result: PhysHMR在多样场景中生成高保真且物理上合理的运动，在视觉准确性和物理真实性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PhysHMR提出了一种统一的视觉到动作策略学习框架，能够直接从单目视频中重建物理上合理的人类运动，显著提升了重建质量和物理真实性。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

### [4] [FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691)
*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种新方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何优化，从自由稀疏图像中实现高质量表面重建，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法通常需要密集校准视图，而自由稀疏图像重建常因有限重叠和过拟合导致表面质量差。FSFSplatter旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FSFSplatter采用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集且几何一致的高斯场景初始化。利用贡献度修剪消除局部浮动物，并通过深度和多视图特征监督结合可微分相机参数在快速优化中减轻过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上表现优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: FSFSplatter通过集成端到端的密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强的场景优化，显著提高了从自由稀疏图像中进行快速表面重建的质量，并在DTU和Replica数据集上超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

Conclusion: 研究表明，人类与机器在面部识别中的协作可以显著提高准确性，尤其是在遵循‘近端准确性规则’（PAR）的情况下。智能人机融合比单独使用机器或简单结合所有人类和机器判断更准确。这为AI在面部识别中的智能应用提供了基于证据的指导。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

*Jiapeng Tang,Matthew Lavine,Dor Verbin,Stephan J. Garbin,Matthias Nießner,Ricardo Martin Brualla,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Philipp Henzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROGR是一种新方法，通过双分支光照条件NeRF实现高效重光照，无需逐光照优化，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在从多视角捕获物体并重建可重光照的3D模型，通过生成式重光照模型模拟物体在新光照环境下的效果。

Method: 该方法通过在多光照环境下采样物体外观，训练一个光照条件NeRF，利用双分支架构分别编码一般光照效果和镜面反射。

Result: 在TensoIR和Stanford-ORB数据集上，ROGR在大多数指标上优于现有技术，并在真实物体捕获中展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: ROGR通过创新的双分支架构和光照条件NeRF，成功实现了高效的前馈重光照，无需针对每种光照进行优化或光传输模拟，并在多个数据集上超越了现有技术。

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个针对生成视频模型的不确定性量化框架S-QUBED，通过实验证明其能有效计算校准的总不确定性估计，并分解为偶然性和认知性成分。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [8] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEO是一种无需训练的提示嵌入优化方法，通过优化简单提示的文本嵌入，显著提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像的美学质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对简单提示下预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像美学质量不足的问题，提出一种无需训练的方法来优化提示嵌入，从而提升图像质量。

Method: PEO利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型作为骨干，通过三部分目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化文本嵌入的一致性，并通过提示保留项最小化与初始提示的差异。该方法无需训练且与骨干模型无关。

Result: 定量和定性评估表明，PEO在美学质量上优于或持平于现有的文本到图像和提示适配方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)的新方法，通过优化简单提示的文本嵌入，显著提升了预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像的美学质量，且在定量和定性评估中表现优异。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新型多摄像头系统，用于无约束环境下精确3D手部跟踪，显著提升环境多样性与标注准确性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集多在受控实验室环境下采集，限制了环境多样性和模型泛化能力，因此需要一种能在真实野外条件下精确跟踪手部及其交互的方法。

Method: 结合轻量级背载式捕捉装置、八个外中心摄像头和Meta Quest 3头显，设计了一个多视角捕捉系统，并开发了精确的3D手部姿态跟踪流程。

Result: 通过采集包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿态的标注数据集，验证了该系统在环境真实性与标注准确性之间的平衡能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的多摄像头系统和数据集，显著减少了环境真实性与3D标注准确性之间的权衡，为无约束环境下的手部跟踪提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [10] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视频蒸馏方法，通过输入感知的稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，实现了实时性能并提升了视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的方法由于需要大量去噪步骤和昂贵的注意力机制，导致速度慢，无法实现实时部署。因此，需要一种高效的蒸馏方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的视频蒸馏方法，利用输入的人体姿态条件来优化注意力和损失函数。具体包括使用输入人体姿态关键点的精确对应关系来引导注意力到相关区域，以及引入输入感知的蒸馏损失以提升唇同步和手部动作的真实性。

Result: 该方法实现了实时性能，并在视觉质量上优于近期的音频驱动和输入驱动方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合输入感知的稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，该方法在实现实时性能的同时，相比近期的音频驱动和输入驱动方法，提升了视觉质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FunLoRA是一种新型低秩适配方法，有效解决生成模型持续适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，性能优于现有方法且更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型的持续适应具有重要潜力，但增量训练面临灾难性遗忘和训练时间增加的挑战。

Method: 设计了一种基于低秩适配（LoRA）的新型条件机制FunLoRA，仅使用秩1矩阵，并通过精心选择的函数动态增加其功能秩。

Result: FunLoRA在流匹配模型上的实验表明，其性能优于基于扩散模型的最先进方法，分类准确率更高，且内存成本和采样时间更低。

Conclusion: 提出的FunLoRA方法通过动态条件机制有效解决了深度生成模型在持续适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时显著降低了训练时间和内存消耗。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双视场、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通信号灯和标志的识别，通过多源数据集和三层防御栈框架，显著降低了攻击成功率和高风险误分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）的感知错误直接影响导航和安全性，现有模型对数字对抗攻击和自然扰动（如眩光、雨水、污垢或涂鸦）的脆弱性可能导致危险误分类。当前研究缺乏对时间连续性、多静态视场（FoV）感知以及对数字和自然退化的鲁棒性的考虑。

Method: 基于aiMotive、Udacity、Waymo和自录的德克萨斯地区视频构建多源数据集，对中长序列RGB图像进行时间对齐，覆盖高速公路、夜间、雨天和城市四种操作设计域（ODDs）。提出统一的三层防御栈框架，包括特征压缩、防御蒸馏、基于熵的异常检测以及序列级时间投票。

Result: 统一防御栈实现了79.8mAP，将攻击成功率（ASR）降低至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，同时将高风险误分类降至32%。物理可转移性通过重捕获探针确认。

Conclusion: 该框架在提升自动驾驶车辆对交通信号灯和标志的识别鲁棒性方面表现出色，特别是在对抗攻击和自然扰动环境下，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO通过优化噪声扰动，首次在流匹配模型中实现高效的强化学习，提升了图像质量和人类对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型的确定性使其难以适用于强化学习，而现有随机噪声扰动方法效率低且不稳定。

Method: Smart-GRPO采用迭代搜索策略，解码候选扰动，通过奖励函数评估并优化噪声分布。

Result: 实验表明，Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Smart-GRPO为流匹配模型中的强化学习提供了一种实用路径，通过优化噪声扰动，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

Result: MoGIC在HumanML3D和Mo440H上分别降低了FID 38.6%和34.6%，在运动字幕生成中超越基于LLM的方法，并能进行意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC通过整合意图建模和视觉先验，显著提升了运动生成的精确性和个性化，同时支持意图预测和视觉条件生成，推动了可控运动合成和意图理解的发展。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

Conclusion: 通过运动自适应框架和基于样条的轨迹参数化，显著提升了动态3D重建的质量和效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，难以应对真实噪声的复杂性和多样性；深度学习虽有效但需要大量标注数据且泛化能力有限。Net2Net旨在结合两者优势。

Method: Net2Net结合了无监督DIP和监督预训练模型DRUNet，通过去噪正则化（RED）实现。未训练网络适应输入图像的独特噪声特性，而预训练网络利用大规模数据集学习到的表示提供稳健的去噪性能。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，Net2Net在真实世界噪声去除任务中具有优越性。

Conclusion: Net2Net方法通过结合未训练和预训练网络的优势，在真实世界噪声去除任务中表现出色，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Motivation: 直接应用DeepSeek-R1的方法于检索任务不可行，因计算成本高且结果不稳定。Retrv-R1旨在通过优化设计和训练方法解决这些问题。

Method: Retrv-R1采用信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量，同时保留关键信息；并提出新的训练范式，包括使用合成的CoT数据集进行激活阶段和RL课程奖励。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中展现出SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Retrv-R1通过引入信息压缩模块和新的训练范式，成功解决了DeepSeek-R1在检索任务中的计算成本高和结果不稳定的问题，实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

TL;DR: BCA+是一种无需训练的测试时间适应框架，通过动态缓存和贝叶斯推断提升视觉语言模型在分布变化下的性能，适用于识别和检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLM）如CLIP和Grounding DINO在物体识别和检测方面取得了显著成功，但其在现实世界分布变化下的性能往往下降。现有方法要么依赖计算成本高的反向传播，阻碍实时部署，要么仅关注似然适应，忽略了先验的关键作用。

Method: BCA+引入了一个动态缓存，自适应地存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度（用于检测）以及关键的自适应类别先验，这些先验源自历史预测。将适应问题表述为贝叶斯推断问题，最终预测通过融合初始VLM输出与基于缓存的预测生成。

Result: BCA+在识别和检测基准上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BCA+作为一种无需训练且无需反向传播的高效方法，在识别和检测基准上均实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法局限于预定义的类别，无法识别训练中未见的肿瘤类型。无监督学习缺乏利用标记数据先验知识的能力，而半监督方法通常假设所有潜在类别都在标记数据中表示。

Method: 引入了一种名为HGCD-BT的新方法，结合分层聚类和对比学习，并加入了一种半监督分层聚类损失。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，HGCD-BT在patch-level分类上比现有GCD方法提高了28%的准确率，特别是在识别未见过的肿瘤类别上表现优异。在Digital Brain Tumor Atlas的slide-level分类中也展示了良好的通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT通过结合分层聚类和对比学习，显著提高了脑肿瘤分类的准确性，特别是在识别未见过的肿瘤类别上。该方法在多种成像模态中展示了良好的通用性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

Method: 提出 AdaRD-Key，一种无需训练的关键帧采样模块，通过最大化统一的相关性-多样性最大体积（RD-MV）目标，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件，选择信息丰富且非冗余的帧。

Result: 在 LongVideoBench 和 Video-MME 上的广泛实验表明，AdaRD-Key 在长视频理解任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key 在长视频理解任务中表现出色，特别是在长视频数据集上达到了最先进的性能，且无需额外训练，计算效率高，兼容现有模型。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

Conclusion: 研究表明，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在解决复杂的横向思维挑战（如谜语）时，其推理质量在不同谜题类别中差异显著。模型在视觉构图方面表现系统性强，但在缺失解释和文化象征方面存在根本性局限。提示策略对模型认知方式和问题解决效果有显著影响，说明可解释性是模型性能的内在组成部分。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 医学目标检测在混合模态（如CXR、CT、MRI）上训练时，由于统计异质性和表示空间的不连续性，性能受到影响。论文旨在通过表示对齐方法解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种简单、与检测器无关的框架，通过MoCA和QueryREPA方法，有效提升了跨模态医学目标检测的性能，且无需修改架构，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Conclusion: MaskCD通过利用LVLMs中的'image heads'并对其进行掩码处理，有效缓解了幻觉现象，同时保留了LVLMs的通用能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Conclusion: Med-K2N通过自适应的多模态融合和模态一致性保持，显著优于现有方法，为跨模态医学图像合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

transparency, reproducibility, and further research in this domain.

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \frameworkName{}通过patch-centric范式实现零-shot图像区域描述，无需区域级监督，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零-shot描述模型仅依赖全局图像表示，无法描述图像中的特定区域。\frameworkName{}旨在通过patch-centric方法解决这一限制，实现无需区域级监督的灵活图像描述。

Method: \frameworkName{}采用patch-centric范式，将单个patch作为原子描述单元，并聚合它们来描述任意区域，包括单个patch、非连续区域和整个图像。

Result: 实验表明，\frameworkName{}在零-shot密集描述、区域集描述和新引入的轨迹描述任务中均优于其他基线模型和最先进竞争对手。

Conclusion: 通过将图像描述任务从全局表示转向基于patch的范式，\frameworkName{}展示了在无需区域级监督的情况下描述任意图像区域的能力。实验证明，使用如DINO等能生成有意义、密集视觉特征的骨干网络，是实现最先进性能的关键。

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

TL;DR: MEACI-Net通过双流架构和跨模态交互模块，有效解决压缩视频动作识别中的动态噪声和模态融合问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别因存储和计算成本低而受关注，但存在动态信息粗糙、噪声多以及RGB与运动模态融合不足的问题。MEACI-Net旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MEACI-Net采用双流架构，分别处理RGB模态和运动模态。运动流嵌入多尺度块和去噪模块以增强表示学习，并通过选择性运动补充（SMC）和跨模态增强（CMA）模块强化模态间交互。

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试中，MEACI-Net表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MEACI-Net通过增强运动模态表示和强化跨模态交互，显著提升了压缩视频动作识别的性能，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性和效率。

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

Motivation: 大型视觉基础模型在封闭集语义任务中表现优异，但其在语义分割中检测分布外（OoD）区域的能力尚未充分探索。研究旨在验证这些模型是否能在无需异常监督的情况下区分分布内（ID）和OoD区域。

Method: 提出了一种简单的无训练方法，利用InternImage骨干网络的特征，结合K-Means聚类和原始解码器logits的置信度阈值来识别OoD聚类。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试中达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试中达到48.77，超越多个有监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 大型视觉基础模型（如InternImage）在无需额外监督的情况下，通过简单的无训练方法（如K-Means聚类和置信度阈值）能够有效检测语义分割中的分布外（OoD）区域，为通用OoD分割方法提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

TL;DR: HoloV 是一种新型视觉令牌修剪框架，通过全局视角优化令牌保留策略，显著提升多模态大语言模型的高效推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力的令牌修剪方法在高修剪比例下性能下降显著，主要原因是保留语义相似令牌导致冗余。

Method: HoloV 通过全局视觉上下文自适应分配修剪预算，避免保留语义相似的令牌，从而最小化表示崩溃并保持任务相关信息。

Result: 实验表明，HoloV 在各种任务、MLLM 架构和修剪比例下均优于现有方法，例如 LLaVA1.5 在修剪 88.9% 视觉令牌后仍保留 95.8% 的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV 提供了一种简单而有效的视觉令牌修剪框架，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在高效推理中的性能，尤其在较高修剪比例下仍能保持优异表现。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

TL;DR: CAW通过置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化，提升视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，实验显示其优于现有方法且内存高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本泛化方面表现优异，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱。CAW旨在提升这类模型在零样本场景下的鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个关键组件：(1) 置信度感知损失，通过缩放干净和对抗预测之间的KL散度来优先处理不确定的对抗样本；(2) 特征对齐正则化，通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器特征在对抗输入上的距离来保持语义一致性。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的实验表明，CAW在强攻击（如AutoAttack）下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，且内存占用更低。

Conclusion: CAW（Confidence-Aware Weighting）通过结合置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化，显著提升了视觉语言模型在零样本场景下的鲁棒性，同时保持了泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

Motivation: 可靠的颈动脉粥样硬化疾病风险评估是一个主要临床挑战，需要透明且可解释地整合多样化的临床和影像信息。

Method: 研究提出了一种通过访谈式问题序列模拟真实诊断场景的框架，比较了多种开源LVLMs，包括通用和医学专用模型。使用低秩适应（LoRA）技术将LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna模型适配到超声领域，并整合多模态表格数据。

Result: 零样本实验显示，并非所有LVLMs都能准确识别影像模态和解剖结构，且在风险分类上表现不佳。通过LoRA适配和文本形式的表格数据整合，显著提高了中风风险分层的性能，达到与卷积神经网络基线相当的水平。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在超声心血管风险预测中的潜力与局限性，指出多模态集成、模型校准和领域适应对临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Motivation: 现有方法使用深度自编码器生成器，参数效率低且缺乏可解释的训练策略，因此需要一种更高效、可解释的多相CE MRI合成方法。

Method: 提出Flip Distribution Alignment Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE)，通过将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，有效分离共享和独立特征。采用Y形双向训练策略增强特征分离的可解释性。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有基于深度自编码器的端到端合成方法相比，FDA-VAE在减少模型参数和推理时间的同时，显著提高了合成质量。

Conclusion: FDA-VAE是一种轻量级的特征解耦VAE模型，显著减少了模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提高了多相CE MRI合成的质量。

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

Motivation: 当前T2I模型在理解和遵循长且详细的提示时表现不一致，缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 引入LPG-Bench基准和TIT零样本指标，通过文本-图像-文本一致性量化T2I对齐。包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现。

Result: TIT-Score-LLM在人类偏好对齐上比最强基线提高了7.31%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法共同为评估和促进T2I模型的发展提供了更深入的视角。所有资源将公开。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决现有3D编辑方法速度慢、几何失真或依赖手动3D掩码的问题。

Method: 提出了3DEditFormer，一种3D结构保留的条件变换器，通过双引导注意力和时间自适应门控增强图像到3D的生成。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在定量和定性上均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入3DEditVerse数据集和3DEditFormer模型，显著提升了3D编辑的精确性和一致性，为实际应用设定了新标准。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，在热带地区实用性受限；同时，深度网络下采样过程中空间/光谱细节丢失问题亟待解决。

Method: 开发了云注入算法模拟真实云覆盖，并提出将归一化差异指数（NDIs）注入解码层的轻量方法。

Conclusion: 融合雷达-光学数据在云覆盖条件下显著提升了土地覆盖分割性能，而NDI注入方法在轻量计算下保留了关键空间特征。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法难以建模复杂动态交互，且密集精确的掩码标注在现实应用中难以获取。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架通过解耦的两阶段流程有效解决了交互中心视频生成中的密集掩码标注问题，并在视觉真实性和可控性上优于现有基准。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: PocketSR 是一种超轻量级的单步模型，能够在保持高保真度的同时实现 RealSR，适用于边缘设备，处理 4K 图像仅需 0.8 秒，性能与现有单步甚至多步 RealSR 模型相当。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过MEve提示套件和系统研究，揭示了早期干预在多事件T2V生成中的关键作用，为未来模型提供了方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展到多事件生成时忽略了事件转换的内在因素，本文旨在回答核心问题：何时何地多事件提示控制事件转换。

Method: 本研究引入了MEve，一个自建提示套件，用于评估多事件文本到视频（T2V）生成，并对两个代表性模型家族（OpenSora和CogVideoX）进行了系统研究。

Result: 大量实验表明，早期干预在去噪步骤和块状模型层中的重要性，揭示了多事件视频生成的关键因素。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，早期干预去噪步骤和块状模型层对多事件视频生成至关重要，为未来模型的多事件条件提供了可能性。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event
conditioning in future models.

Conclusion: InsideOut框架通过结合高效架构和针对性处理数据不平衡问题，为FER提供了实用、透明且可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合泛化是视觉生成模型的关键能力，但并非所有促进或抑制它的机制都已被充分理解。

Method: 通过控制实验，研究了训练目标（离散或连续分布）和条件信息（在训练中提供关于组成概念的信息程度）对组合泛化的影响。

Result: 研究发现，训练目标的离散或连续性质以及条件信息的提供程度是影响组合泛化的关键因素。

Conclusion: 通过放松MaskGIT的离散损失并引入基于JEPA的连续辅助目标，可以提升离散模型（如MaskGIT）的组合性能。

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对文本到图像扩散模型在个性化中可能引发的数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用等问题，提出生成“不可学习”的训练样本以抵御未经授权的模型复制。

Method: 提出了一种基于模型的扰动策略，通过在扩散模型的潜在空间中交替去噪和反转，同时修改去噪轨迹的起点。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不可感知性（PSNR、SSIM、FID等指标提升约8%-10%）和鲁棒性（平均提升约10%）方面均有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在潜在扩散模型（LDMs）框架中实现了不可学习性，有效防御了未经授权的模型适应，并在四个基准数据集上验证了其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete通过结合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，显著提升了参考驱动图像补全的性能，几何准确性和视觉质量均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机姿态或深度），导致补全内容错位或不合理。因此，需要一种能够结合显式3D结构指导的方法，以增强补全区域的几何一致性。

Method: GeoComplete框架采用双分支扩散架构，一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云中提取几何特征。通过跨分支的联合自注意力确保补全的连贯性和准确性。此外，采用目标感知掩码策略，指导模型关注有用的参考线索。

Result: 实验表明，GeoComplete在PSNR上比现有最先进方法提升了17.1，显著提高了几何准确性，同时保持了高视觉质量。

Conclusion: GeoComplete提出了一种统一且稳健的解决方案，通过结合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，显著提升了参考驱动图像补全的几何准确性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的HVGC框架和BridgeDiT模型在T2SV任务中取得了最先进的性能，并通过消融实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分层处理视觉皮层信息，显著提升复杂场景下的视觉信息重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重建高度复杂视觉刺激时面临挑战，主要因为自然场景的低级特征异质性和高级特征的语义纠缠。

Method: HAVIR模型将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域，分别提取特征：Structural Generator从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验，Semantic Extractor将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入，最后通过Versatile Diffusion模型合成图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，HAVIR在复杂场景中提升了重建的结构和语义质量，性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR模型通过分层处理视觉皮层信息，显著提升了复杂场景下视觉信息重建的结构和语义质量，优于现有模型。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: Markovian Reeb Graphs被定位为一个可扩展的轨迹模拟框架，适用于多样化的城市环境。

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

Result: 在SpineBench上评估的先进LVLMs显示出在精细层级推理上的系统性弱点，而基于SpineMed-450k微调的模型在所有任务上均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: SpineMed生态系统通过引入SpineMed-450k数据集和SpineBench评估框架，显著提升了AI在脊柱疾病诊断中的精细化和多模态推理能力，临床评估证实了其输出的诊断清晰度和实用性。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Conclusion: UniShield 提出了一种创新的多代理统一系统，能够跨多个领域检测和定位图像伪造，展现了卓越的实用性、适应性和可扩展性，超越了现有的统一方法和领域特定检测器。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Abstract: Interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation requires efficient models that

sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU. For efficient training, we
initialize our network using the publicly available weights from the

strong performance with an average final Dice score of 0.6385, normalized

TL;DR: 提出一种测试时防御机制，通过随机共振和特征对齐增强对抗攻击鲁棒性，无需训练或特定架构修改，在多项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对对抗性攻击（不可察觉的图像扰动会显著改变模型预测）的问题，现有方法依赖于特征过滤或平滑可能导致信息丢失，因此作者提出'以噪声对抗噪声'的创新思路。

Method: 该方法通过对输入图像引入小的平移扰动，对齐转换后的特征嵌入，并在映射回原始参考图像前进行聚合，整个过程可用闭式公式表达，无需额外网络模块或针对特定攻击类型的微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在图像分类中恢复了高达68.1%的准确率损失，在立体匹配和光流任务中分别恢复了71.9%和29.2%的性能，展现了其多功能性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种无需训练、架构无关且攻击无关的测试时防御机制，通过利用随机共振增强鲁棒性并最小化信息损失，在图像分类和密集预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

Method: PQGAN是一个量化的图像自编码器，将PQ集成到VQGAN的向量量化（VQ）框架中。通过深入分析码本大小、嵌入维度和子空间分解之间的相互作用，优化超参数选择。

Result: PQGAN在重建性能上显著优于现有方法，PSNR达到37dB（先前工作为27dB），FID、LPIPS和CMMD分数降低了96%。此外，PQGAN能够无缝集成到预训练的扩散模型中，实现更快速、高效生成或双倍输出分辨率。

Conclusion: PQGAN通过将产品量化（PQ）集成到VQGAN框架中，显著提升了图像重建性能，并在预训练的扩散模型中无缝集成，展示了PQ在图像合成中作为离散潜在表示的强大扩展。

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在GUI grounding任务中面临高分辨率显示下patch-to-pixel映射不可靠的问题，导致准确率下降。

Method: 提出了RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记，以及Interleaved MRoPE（I-MRoPE）方法改进空间编码，确保宽度和高度维度的均衡表示。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示，该方法在高分辨率界面上的grounding准确性有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过引入RULER tokens和I-MRoPE方法，显著提升了GUI grounding任务在高分辨率界面上的准确性，为跨平台自动化提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

Result: 实验表明，Memory Forcing在多样环境中实现了卓越的长期空间一致性和生成质量，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: Memory Forcing框架通过结合几何索引的空间记忆和特定的训练协议，成功实现了在有限计算预算下长期空间一致性和生成质量的平衡。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

Conclusion: Mixer，一种新型随机神经网络，通过结合超球面随机嵌入和双分支学习模块，显著提升了纹理表示学习的效果，实验证明了其在多种纹理基准测试中的优异表现。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled

selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

Abstract: The advancement of 6G technology has the potential to revolutionize the
transportation sector and significantly improve how we travel. 6G-enabled
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) promise to offer high-speed,
low-latency communication and advanced data analytics capabilities, supporting
the development of safer, more efficient, and more sustainable transportation
solutions. However, various security and privacy challenges were identified in
the literature that must be addressed to enable the safe and secure deployment
of 6G-ITS and ensure people's trust in using these technologies. This paper
reviews the opportunities and challenges of 6G-ITS, particularly focusing on
trust, security, and privacy, with special attention to quantum technologies
that both enhance security through quantum key distribution and introduce new
vulnerabilities. It discusses the potential benefits of 6G technology in the
transportation sector, including improved communication, device
interoperability support, data analytic capabilities, and increased automation
for different components, such as transportation management and communication
systems. A taxonomy of different attack models in 6G-ITS is proposed, and a
comparison of the security threats in 5G-ITS and 6G-ITS is provided, along with
potential mitigating solutions. This research highlights the urgent need for a
comprehensive, multi-layered security framework spanning physical
infrastructure protection, network protocol security, data management
safeguards, application security measures, and trust management systems to
effectively mitigate emerging security and privacy risks and ensure the
integrity and resilience of future transportation ecosystems.

Motivation: 蜂窝无线接入网络（RAN）在低延迟信号机制方面落后于有线宽带，需要一种轻量级且易于部署的解决方案。

Method: 通过抽象 RAN 队列复杂性，L4Span 预测队列占用率并在毫秒级时间尺度上执行 ECN 标记。基于 srsRAN 开源软件用 C++ 实现原型。

Result: L4Span 将低延迟和经典流量的单向延迟降低了高达 98%，同时保持接近线速的吞吐量。

Conclusion: L4Span 是一种轻量级、兼容现有标准的 RAN 设计，显著降低了低延迟和经典流量的单向延迟，同时保持高吞吐量。

Abstract: Design for low latency networking is essential for tomorrow's interactive
applications, but it is essential to deploy incrementally and universally at
the network's last mile. While wired broadband ISPs are rolling out the leading
queue occupancy signaling mechanisms, the cellular Radio Access Network (RAN),
another important last mile to many users, lags behind these efforts. This
paper proposes a new RAN design, L4Span, that abstracts the complexities of RAN
queueing in a simple interface, thus tying the queue state of the RAN to
end-to-end low-latency signaling all the way back to the content server. At
millisecond-level timescales, L4Span predicts the RAN's queuing occupancy and
performs ECN marking for both low-latency and classic flows. L4Span is
lightweight, requiring minimal RAN modifications, and remains 3GPP and O-RAN
compliant for maximum ease of deployment. We implement a prototype on the
srsRAN open-source software in C++. Our evaluation compares the performance of
low-latency as well as classic flows with or without the deployment of L4Span
in various wireless channel conditions. Results show that L4Span reduces the
one-way delay of both low-latency and classic flows by up to 98 %, while
simultaneously maintaining near line-rate throughput. The code is available at

Motivation: 非地面网络（NTN）在广泛覆盖和动态链路的挑战下，现有随机接入方案（如ALOHA、CSMA和BSMA）性能不足，亟需一种高效、低碰撞的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Free Signal Multiple Access（FSMA）协议，通过轻量级的FreeChirp信号确保节点仅在信道空闲且链路可靠时传输，从而减少碰撞并实现无需同步的链路感知访问。

Result: 实验和模拟显示，FSMA相比基线方案实现了2倍吞吐量提升、2至5倍的包接收率改善及5倍的能源效率提升，并能支持每卫星通过5000+设备的大规模应用。

Conclusion: FSMA被证明是一种可扩展、高效且可靠的非地面网络（NTN）物联网解决方案，显著提升了吞吐量、包接收率和能源效率。

Abstract: The proliferation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for universal IoT
applications and the growing use of drones in emergency services, agriculture,
and military operations highlight the transformative potential of
non-terrestrial networks (NTN). However, these networks face two key
challenges: (1) large coverage footprints that create frequent collisions and
(2) moving gateways that cause dynamic links and demand synchronization-free,
link-aware transmissions. Existing random access schemes such as ALOHA, CSMA,
and BSMA fail in this setting, suffering from high collision rates, hidden
terminals, or excessive gateway energy overhead. We propose Free Signal
Multiple Access (FSMA), a gateway-controlled protocol that introduces a
lightweight free signal chirp (FreeChirp). FreeChirp ensures that nodes
transmit only when the channel is idle and when links are reliable, thereby
reducing collisions and enabling link-aware access without the need for
synchronization or complex scheduling. We evaluate FSMA using 25 commercial
LoRa devices with a drone-mounted moving gateway and demonstrate up to 2x
higher throughput, 2x to 5x better packet reception ratio, and 5x improved
energy efficiency compared to the baselines. Large-scale simulations with a
custom Satellite IoT Simulator further show that FSMA scales to 5000+ devices
per satellite pass. These results establish FSMA as a practical step toward
scalable, energy-efficient, and reliable NTN IoT networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在广域动态量子网络中公平且匿名分配稀缺纠缠的问题，避免后选择协调，并满足匿名性和公平性。

Method: 采用两层纯量子抽签机制：外层选择获胜的QLAN，内层选择每个获胜QLAN内的获胜节点。关键设计原则是通过测量固定获胜集和每QLAN配额，避免经典往返。

Result: DH-EAC在成功率、端到端延迟、吞吐量和Jain公平指数等指标上优于单层Dicke和经典GO驱动的分配器。

Conclusion: DH-EAC提供了一个可实现的纠缠访问控制设计点，平衡了纯量子竞争解决、匿名性和多QLAN网络的可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose Dynamic, Hierarchical Entanglement Access Control (DH-EAC), a
pure-quantum protocol for fair and anonymous allocation of scarce entanglement
across wide-area quantum networks composed of many quantum LANs (QLANs). Prior
Dicke-state-based pure-quantum MACs resolve contention by local measurements
without classical signaling, but they mainly target a single QLAN under static
conditions; extending them to wide-area, dynamic settings while avoiding
post-selection reconciliation remains open. DH-EAC adopts a two-layer
pure-quantum lottery: the outer layer selects winning QLANs and the inner layer
selects winning nodes within each winning QLAN. A key design principle is that
both the winning set and the per-QLAN quota are fixed by measurements alone, so
the contention loop requires no classical round trip. The protocol thus aims to
jointly satisfy anonymity (no node IDs revealed until decisions are fixed) and
fairness (bias suppression under heterogeneous QLAN sizes). We also provide
analytical models for success probability and latency under a standard i.i.d.
loss model, and we evaluate DH-EAC against two baselines - single-layer Dicke
within one QLAN and a classical GO-driven allocator - using a minimal,
reproducible set of scenarios. Metrics include success probability, end-to-end
latency, throughput, and Jain's fairness index. The results indicate that
DH-EAC offers an implementable design point in the space of entanglement access
control, balancing pure-quantum contention resolution, anonymity, and
scalability for multi-QLAN networks.

Abstract: Efficient handover management remains a critical challenge in dense urban
cellular networks, where high cell density, user mobility, and diverse service
demands increase the likelihood of unnecessary handovers and ping-pong effects.
This paper leverages a real-world, multi-operator drive-test dataset of 30,925
labelled records collected within a 2 km area around Sunway City to investigate
sequence-based deep learning approaches for handover detection and avoidance.
We formulate handover prediction as a sequence problem and evaluate Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer
architectures under Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)-only and all-feature
settings. The integration of multi-dimensional features significantly enhanced
handover performance in dense urban cellular networks. The proposed GRU-based
model achieved a remarkable 98% reduction in ping-pong handovers, alongside a
46.25% decrease in unnecessary handovers, outperforming the baseline RSRP-only
approach which yielded a 22.19% reduction. Furthermore, the model demonstrated
a 46% improvement in Time of Stay (ToS), indicating more stable user
connections. With an inference time of just 0.91 seconds, the solution proves
highly efficient and well-suited for real-time edge deployment scenarios.
Compared to the conventional 3GPP A3 algorithm, these improvements demonstrate
significant gains in mobility robustness and user Quality of Experience (QoE)
improvement. The dataset is released to foster reproducibility and further
research in intelligent mobility management for 5G and beyond.

Abstract: The increased use of software in the operation and management of
telecommunication networks has moved the industry one step closer to realizing
autonomous network operation. One consequence of this shift is the
significantly increased need for testing and validation before such software

however, they require significant time and human effort to configure and

experimental results for an initial use case, demonstrating that the approach
is feasible in automatically creating efficient digital twins with sufficient

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种无需额外训练的高效算法，能够在8步内生成高质量的512x512和1024x1024图像，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越的FID性能。

Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an
image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation
process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation
or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation
error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free
algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight
steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our
algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8
steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation
model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also
generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than
the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We
validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO
2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and
17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further,
it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID
performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in
five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID
performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61,
respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED
Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the
state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We
also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps,

Abstract: The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as
autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where
tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal
exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite
advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for
interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud
visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density
variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of
spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping
visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that
categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to
fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization
strategies based on data types, user objectives, and visualization techniques,
our framework provides a foundation for advancing more effective,

representation. The core of GS-Share includes anchor-based global map
construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update.
We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our
system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with
improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively.
Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission
overhead by 36%.

### [68] [Even Faster Kernel Matrix Linear Algebra via Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02540)
*Rikhav Shah,Sandeep Silwal,Haike Xu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文改进了核密度估计（KDE）在核矩阵相关任务中的应用，降低了计算复杂度，特别是在大规模数据集下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是提高核矩阵相关任务的效率，特别是在高维数据和大规模数据集下，现有算法的计算复杂度较高，限制了其应用。

Method: 论文提出了一种改进的算法，用于计算核矩阵的矩阵-向量乘积、矩阵-矩阵乘积、谱范数和所有元素的和，这些算法在时间和空间复杂度上优于现有最佳算法（如Backurs等人的算法）。

Result: 改进后的算法在计算核矩阵相关任务时，显著降低了对n的依赖性，并在多项式时间内减少了误差ε的影响。特别是在计算核矩阵所有元素和时，对n的依赖性进一步降低。

Conclusion: 论文通过改进算法，显著降低了计算核矩阵相关任务的时间和空间复杂度，特别是在使用核密度估计查询时对n的依赖性大幅减少。此外，论文还提供了相关问题的下界，揭示了基于KDE方法的局限性。

Abstract: This paper studies the use of kernel density estimation (KDE) for linear
algebraic tasks involving the kernel matrix of a collection of $n$ data points
in $\mathbb R^d$. In particular, we improve upon existing algorithms for
computing the following up to $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error: matrix-vector
products, matrix-matrix products, the spectral norm, and sum of all entries.
The runtimes of our algorithms depend on the dimension $d$, the number of
points $n$, and the target error $\varepsilon$. Importantly, the dependence on
$n$ in each case is far lower when accessing the kernel matrix through KDE
queries as opposed to reading individual entries.
  Our improvements over existing best algorithms (particularly those of
Backurs, Indyk, Musco, and Wagner '21) for these tasks reduce the polynomial
dependence on $\varepsilon$, and additionally decreases the dependence on $n$
in the case of computing the sum of all entries of the kernel matrix.
  We complement our upper bounds with several lower bounds for related
problems, which provide (conditional) quadratic time hardness results and
additionally hint at the limits of KDE based approaches for the problems we
study.

*Gary Hoppenworth,Thatchaphol Saranurak,Benyu Wang*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文几乎填补了有向图$k$-容错连接保持器的边数差距，提出$O(k4^{k}n\log n)$边的构造，并改进了$k$-连接保持器的边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对有向图中$k$-容错连接保持器边数上限与下限之间的显著差距，以及$k$-连接保持器的现有边界不足，论文旨在提出更优的构造方法和理论结果。

Method: 通过证明和构造，论文提出了一种新的$k$-容错连接保持器，其边数接近最优，并改进了$k$-连接保持器的现有最佳边界。

Result: 论文证明了存在一种$k$-容错连接保持器，其边数为$O(k4^{k}n\log n)$，并可在多项式时间内构造出边数为$O(8^{k}n\log^{5/2}n)$的保持器。同时，改进了$k$-连接保持器的边界至$O(k4^{k}n\log n)$。

Conclusion: 该论文几乎填补了有向图中$k$-容错连接保持器的边数上限与下限之间的显著差距，提出了一种具有$O(k4^{k}n\log n)$边的构造方法，并在多项式时间内实现了$O(8^{k}n\log^{5/2}n)$边的构造。

Abstract: A $k$-fault-tolerant connectivity preserver of a directed $n$-vertex graph
$G$ is a subgraph $H$ such that, for any edge set $F \subseteq E(G)$ of size
$|F| \le k$, the strongly connected components of $G - F$ and $H - F$ are the
same. While some graphs require a preserver with $\Omega(2^{k}n)$ edges
[BCR18], the best-known upper bound is $\tilde{O}(k2^{k}n^{2-1/k})$ edges
[CC20], leaving a significant gap of $\Omega(n^{1-1/k})$. In contrast, there is
no gap in undirected graphs; the optimal bound of $\Theta(kn)$ has been
well-established since the 90s [NI92].
  We nearly close the gap for directed graphs; we prove that there exists a
$k$-fault-tolerant connectivity preserver with $O(k4^{k}n\log n)$ edges, and we
can construct one with $O(8^{k}n\log^{5/2}n)$ edges in $\text{poly}(2^{k}n)$
time.
  Our results also improve the state-of-the-art for a closely related object; a
\textit{$k$-connectivity preserver} of $G$ is a subgraph $H$ where, for all $i
\le k$, the strongly $i$-connected components of $G$ and $H$ agree. By a known
reduction, we obtain a $k$-connectivity preserver with $O(k4^{k}n\log n)$
edges, improving the previous best bound of $\tilde{O}(k2^{k}n^{2-1/(k-1)})$
[CC20]. Therefore, for any constant $k$, our results are optimal to a $\log n$
factor for both problems.
  Lastly, we show that the exponential dependency on $k$ is not inherent for
$k$-connectivity preservers by presenting another construction with $O(n
\sqrt{kn})$ edges.

Motivation: 研究图的顶点嵌入树的最小拥塞问题，旨在优化计算机科学和物理中的实际应用。

Method: 论文采用拉普拉斯特征值分析图的拥塞边界，并提出了一种基于分层谱聚类的收缩启发式算法。

Result: 论文证明了拥塞$\mathrm{cng}(G)$的上下界与图的拉普拉斯特征值相关，并通过数值实验验证了启发式算法在稀疏图中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文通过研究图的顶点嵌入树的最小拥塞问题，提出了基于拉普拉斯特征值的拥塞边界，并开发了一种有效的分层谱聚类启发式算法。

Abstract: Embedding the vertices of arbitrary graphs into trees while minimizing some
measure of overlap is an important problem with applications in computer
science and physics. In this work, we consider the problem of bijectively
embedding the vertices of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ into the leaves of an
$n$-leaf rooted binary tree $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion of such an embedding
is given by the largest size of the cut induced by the two components obtained
by deleting any vertex of $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion $\mathrm{cng}(G)$ is
defined as the minimum congestion obtained by any embedding. We show that
$\lambda_2(G)\cdot 2n/9\le \mathrm{cng} (G)\le \lambda_n(G)\cdot 2n/9$, where
$0=\lambda_1(G)\le \cdots \le \lambda_n(G)$ are the Laplacian eigenvalues of
$G$. We also provide a contraction heuristic given by hierarchically spectral
clustering the original graph, which we numerically find to be effective in
finding low congestion embeddings for sparse graphs. We numerically compare our
congestion bounds on different families of graphs with regular structure
(hypercubes and lattices), random graphs, and tensor network representations of
quantum circuits. Our results imply lower and upper bounds on the memory
complexity of tensor network contraction in terms of the underlying graph.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种利用对称性的质量转移枚举算法，显著减少搜索空间，使处理更深的树成为可能，理论下限为$\mathcal{O}\bigl(D^{1/2}1.612^{D}\bigr)$，实验验证高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的深度-$D$树在枚举路径时会产生$\mathcal{O}(3^{D})$的轨迹，导致枚举不可行。论文旨在通过利用对称性减少搜索空间，使更深的树成为可能。

Method: 利用时间同质动态下的两种对称性（节点的平移不变性和路径与弱组合之间的双射关系），开发了一种质量转移枚举算法，生成每个路径等价类的唯一代表。

Result: 算法将搜索空间减少了一个指数因子，理论下限为$\mathcal{O}\bigl(D^{1/2}1.612^{D}\bigr)$，实验验证了其高效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于对称性的质量转移枚举算法，显著减少了搜索空间，使得处理更深的树成为可能，从而提供了更精确的数值近似。

Abstract: Recombining trinomial trees are a workhorse for modeling discrete-event
systems in option pricing, logistics, and feedback control. Because each node
stores a state-dependent quantity, a depth-$D$ tree naively yields
$\mathcal{O}(3^{D})$ trajectories, making exhaustive enumeration infeasible.
Under time-homogeneous dynamics, however, the graph exhibits two exploitable
symmetries: (i) translational invariance of nodes and (ii) a canonical
bijection between admissible paths and ordered tuples encoding weak
compositions. Leveraging these, we introduce a mass-shifting enumeration
algorithm that slides integer "masses" through a cardinality tuple to generate
exactly one representative per path-equivalence class while implicitly counting
the associated weak compositions. This trims the search space by an exponential
factor, enabling markedly deeper trees -- and therefore tighter numerical
approximations of the underlying evolution -- to be processed in practice. We
further derive an upper bound on the combinatorial counting expression that
induces a theoretical lower bound on the algorithmic cost of approximately
$\mathcal{O}\bigl(D^{1/2}1.612^{D}\bigr)$. This correspondence permits direct
benchmarking while empirical tests, whose pseudo-code we provide, corroborate
the bound, showing only a small constant overhead and substantial speedups over
classical breadth-first traversal. Finally, we highlight structural links
between our algorithmic/combinatorial framework and Motzkin paths with
Narayana-type refinements, suggesting refined enumerative formulas and new
potential analytic tools for path-dependent functionals.

### [72] [Pareto-optimal Non-uniform Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02795)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种帕累托最优的非均匀语言生成算法，适用于理想及实际场景，解决了先前算法生成时间次优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究虽然展示了非均匀生成保证，但其语言生成时间t(L)可能严格次优。本研究旨在探索帕累托最优性，以在非均匀语言生成中实现最佳性能。

Method: 研究提出了一种算法框架，该框架不仅适用于理想情况下的语言生成，还能适应噪声和代表性生成等实际场景。

Result: 提出的算法在生成时间上实现了（几乎）帕累托最优，即在某些语言上的生成时间优于其他算法时，不会在其他语言上表现更差。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种算法，其生成时间t*(L)几乎达到了帕累托最优，即在非均匀语言生成中实现了最佳可能性能。

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed an interesting model for
language generation in the limit: Given a countable collection of languages,
and an adversary enumerating the strings of some language $L$ from the
collection, the objective is to generate new strings from the target language,
such that all strings generated beyond some finite time are valid. Li, Raman
and Tewari (2024) and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform
generation guarantees in this model, giving algorithms that generate new valid
strings from $L$ after seeing a number of distinct input strings $t(L)$ that
depends only on $L$ (and the collection), but not the enumeration order.
However, for both these works, the language-wise generation times $t(L)$ of the
algorithm can be strictly sub-optimal.
  In this work, we study Pareto-optimality of non-uniform language generation
in the limit. We propose an algorithm, whose generation times $t^\star(L)$ are
(almost) Pareto-optimal: any other algorithm whose generation time for some
language $L$ is strictly smaller than $t^\star(L)$, must satisfy that its
generation time for some other language $L'$ is strictly worse than
$t^\star(L')$. Pareto-optimality is essentially the best that one can achieve
for non-uniform generation. Our algorithmic framework conveniently adapts to
further give Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation algorithms in the
practically motivated settings of noisy as well as representative generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决最大基数匹配问题的“树状版本”，即在弧插入过程中维护最大弧基数的森林。

Method: 论文研究了如何在最小化调整（总改变弧数）的情况下，通过弧插入维护最大弧基数的森林。

Result: 结果表明，敌对弧到达可能导致线性调整，而随机弧到达则能实现更优的调整次数。

Conclusion: 该论文观察到在插入模型中，敌对弧到达可能导致Ω(m·n)的调整，同时提出了一个在随机弧到达情况下期望调整次数为O(m·log²n)的算法。

Abstract: In this work, we study how to maintain a forest of arborescences of maximum
arc cardinality under arc insertions while minimizing recourse -- the total
number of arcs changed in the maintained solution. This problem is the
"arborescence version'' of max cardinality matching.
  On the impossibility side, we observe that even in this insertion-only model,
it is possible for $m$ adversarial arc arrivals to necessarily incur $\Omega(m
\cdot n)$ recourse, matching a trivial upper bound of $O(m \cdot n)$. On the
possibility side, we give an algorithm with expected recourse $O(m \cdot \log^2
n)$ if all $m$ arcs arrive uniformly at random.

Motivation: 为了在凸体K上高效均匀采样，提出新的MCMC算法以克服现有方法的局限性。

Method: 基于交替采样框架/近端采样器，利用Gibbs采样在增广分布上进行采样，并通过拒绝采样和访问投影或分离预言机实现受限高斯预言机（RGO）的高效实现。

Result: 在投影或分离预言机的情况下，建立了非渐近复杂度，能够获得以Rényi散度或χ²散度衡量的无偏样本。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于交替采样框架/近端采样器的新MCMC算法，用于在凸体K上均匀采样。通过拒绝采样和访问投影或分离预言机，实现了受限高斯预言机（RGO）的高效实现，并建立了在Rényi散度或χ²散度衡量下的非渐近复杂度。

Abstract: We propose new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to sample a uniform
distribution on a convex body $K$. Our algorithms are based on the Alternating
Sampling Framework/proximal sampler, which uses Gibbs sampling on an augmented
distribution and assumes access to the so-called restricted Gaussian oracle
(RGO). The key contribution of this work is the efficient implementation of RGO
for uniform sampling on $K$ via rejection sampling and access to either a
projection oracle or a separation oracle on $K$. In both oracle cases, we
establish non-asymptotic complexities to obtain unbiased samples where the
accuracy is measured in R\'enyi divergence or $\chi^2$-divergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Tensor PCA中对数因子是否必要的问题，以理解多项式时间算法是否能在更低信号强度下恢复信号，这对量子加速问题具有重要意义。

Method: 采用基于Kikuchi层次结构的谱算法，结合随机矩阵理论和自由概率论的非渐近技术。

Result: 证明了在信号强度λ≥Θ_r(1)·n^(-r/4)·ℓ^(1/2-r/4)时，基于Kikuchi层次结构的谱算法有效。

Conclusion: 本研究通过基于Kikuchi层次结构的谱算法，成功解决了Tensor PCA中对数因子是否必要的问题，证明了在信号强度λ≥Θ_r(1)·n^(-r/4)·ℓ^(1/2-r/4)时算法有效。

Abstract: In this work, we revisit algorithms for Tensor PCA: given an order-$r$ tensor
of the form $T = G+\lambda \cdot v^{\otimes r}$ where $G$ is a random symmetric
Gaussian tensor with unit variance entries and $v$ is an unknown boolean vector
in $\{\pm 1\}^n$, what's the minimum $\lambda$ at which one can distinguish $T$
from a random Gaussian tensor and more generally, recover $v$? As a result of a
long line of work, we know that for any $\ell \in \N$, there is a $n^{O(\ell)}$
time algorithm that succeeds when the signal strength $\lambda \gtrsim
\sqrt{\log n} \cdot n^{-r/4} \cdot \ell^{1/2-r/4}$. The question of whether the
logarithmic factor is necessary turns out to be crucial to understanding
whether larger polynomial time allows recovering the signal at a lower signal
strength. Such a smooth trade-off is necessary for tensor PCA being a candidate
problem for quantum speedups[SOKB25]. It was first conjectured by [WAM19] and
then, more recently, with an eye on smooth trade-offs, reiterated in a blogpost
of Bandeira.
  In this work, we resolve these conjectures and show that spectral algorithms
based on the Kikuchi hierarchy \cite{WAM19} succeed whenever $\lambda \geq
\Theta_r(1) \cdot n^{-r/4} \cdot \ell^{1/2-r/4}$ where $\Theta_r(1)$ only hides
an absolute constant independent of $n$ and $\ell$. A sharp bound such as this
was previously known only for $\ell \leq 3r/4$ via non-asymptotic techniques in
random matrix theory inspired by free probability.

TL;DR: CWM是一个320亿参数的开源LLM，通过世界模型和多任务强化学习提升代码生成和推理能力，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进仅通过静态代码训练所能达到的代码理解水平，探索世界模型在代码生成和推理中的应用。

Method: 通过在中训练阶段使用大量Python解释器和Docker环境的观察-行动轨迹，并结合多任务推理强化学习，提升了代码理解能力。

Result: CWM在多个任务上表现优异，包括SWE-bench Verified（65.8%）、LiveCodeBench（68.6%）、Math-500（96.6%）和AIME 2024（76.0%）。

Conclusion: CWM提供了一个强大的测试平台，供研究者探索世界模型在代码生成中的潜力，特别是在推理和规划方面。

Abstract: We release Code World Model (CWM), a 32-billion-parameter open-weights LLM,
to advance research on code generation with world models. To improve code
understanding beyond what can be learned from training on static code alone, we
mid-train CWM on a large amount of observation-action trajectories from Python
interpreter and agentic Docker environments, and perform extensive multi-task
reasoning RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering
environments. With CWM, we provide a strong testbed for researchers to explore
the opportunities world modeling affords for improving code generation with
reasoning and planning in computational environments. We present first steps of
how world models can benefit agentic coding, enable step-by-step simulation of
Python code execution, and show early results of how reasoning can benefit from
the latter. CWM is a dense, decoder-only LLM trained with a context size of up
to 131k tokens. Independent of its world modeling capabilities, CWM offers
strong performance on general coding and math tasks: it reaches pass@1 scores
of 65.8% on SWE-bench Verified (with test-time scaling), 68.6% on
LiveCodeBench, 96.6% on Math-500, and 76.0% on AIME 2024. To support further

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在孤立检查代码、处理长上下文和粗粒度检测方面存在局限，无法为工程师提供精确的行级定位和针对性修补指导。

Method: T2L-Agent采用多轮反馈机制，结合Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA)，融合运行时证据（如崩溃点、堆栈跟踪和覆盖率差异）与基于AST的代码分块，实现迭代优化和行级精准诊断。

Result: 在T2L-ARVO基准测试中，T2L-Agent实现了58.0%的检测率和54.8%的行级定位率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: T2L-Agent和T2L-ARVO共同推动了基于LLM的漏洞检测从粗粒度识别向可部署、稳健的精准诊断迈进，减少了噪声并加速了开源软件工作流中的修补。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet
prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and
focus on coarse function- or file-level detections - offering limited
actionable guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization and
targeted patches in real-world software development. We present T2L-Agent
(Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own
analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable
lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer
(ATA) that fuses runtime evidence - crash points, stack traces, and coverage
deltas - with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond
single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level
diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce
T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash
families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support
both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous
evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On
T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level
localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework
and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification
toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and
accelerate patching in open-source software workflows.

Motivation: 现有离线偏好优化方法主要关注通过通过/失败信号增强LLMs的编码能力，忽视了失败代码中的深层错误类型。

Method: 构建错误笔记本，逐步优化LLM以按类型纠正错误，并自适应回放错误类型以适应训练过程中LLM的弱点变化。

Result: 在参数范围从0.5B到34B的代码和通用LLMs（Llama、Qwen和DeepSeek系列）上进行的广泛实验表明，AP2O-Coder在pass@k指标上提高了高达3%的代码生成性能。

Conclusion: AP2O-Coder通过自适应和渐进式优化方法，显著提升了LLMs在代码生成任务中的表现，减少了编译和运行时错误，同时使用更少的偏好数据。

Abstract: LLMs' code generation capabilities have yielded substantial improvements in
the effectiveness of programming tasks. However, LLM-generated code still
suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference
optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using
pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error
types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive
Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that
guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code
generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and
progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we
adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses
throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and
general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from
0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in
pass@k while using less preference data. Code: https://github.com/TsingZ0/AP2O

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个关于FaaS环境中资源配置技术的分类法，并分析了现有文献以全面回顾当前函数配置研究。同时，指出了研究空白并提出了未来研究方向，以增强函数配置能力并推动无服务器计算的更广泛采用。

Abstract: The serverless cloud computing model offers a framework where the service
provider abstracts the underlying infrastructure management from developers. In
this serverless model, FaaS provides an event-driven, function-oriented
computing service characterised by fine-grained, usage-based pricing that
eliminates cost for idle resources. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions,
and Cloud Run Functions require developers to configure their function(s) with
minimum operational resources for its successful execution. This resource
allocation influences both the operational expense and the performance quality
of these functions. However, a noticeable lack of platform transparency forces
developers to rely on expert knowledge or experience-based ad-hoc decisions to
request desired function resources. This makes optimal resource configuration a
non-trivial task while adhering to performance constraints. Furthermore, while
commercial platforms often scale resources like CPU and network bandwidth
proportional to memory, open-source frameworks permit independent configuration
of function resources, introducing additional complexity for developers aiming
to optimise their functions. These complexities have directed researchers to
resolve developer challenges and advance towards an efficient server-less
execution model. In this article, we identify different aspects of resource
configuration techniques in FaaS settings and propose a taxonomy of factors
that influence function design, configuration, run-time cost, and performance
guarantees. We conduct an analysis of existing literature on resource
configuration to present a comprehensive review of current studies on function
configuration. We also identify existing research gaps and suggest future
research directions to enhance function configuration and strengthen the
capabilities of serverless computing environments to drive its broader
adoption.

Motivation: 生成式AI正在改变知识工作的性质，但目前对产品经理工作如何因此演变的理解不足。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，包括对885名产品经理的调查、731名产品经理的遥测数据分析以及15名产品经理的访谈。

Result: 研究贡献包括：(1) 产品经理当前的生成式AI采用率、使用案例及感知的益处与障碍；(2) 一个框架，描述产品经理如何评估将任务委派给生成式AI；(3) 产品经理整合生成式AI到其角色的适应实践及对其角色演变的看法。

Conclusion: 研究讨论了生成式AI对产品经理工作的影响，并提出了更广泛的生成式AI工作流程采用和软件开发角色的启示。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is changing the nature of knowledge work, particularly
for Product Managers (PMs) in software development teams. While much software
engineering research has focused on developers' interactions with GenAI, there
is less understanding of how the work of PMs is evolving due to GenAI. To
address this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study at Microsoft, a large,
multinational software company: surveying 885 PMs, analyzing telemetry data for
a subset of PMs (N=731), and interviewing a subset of 15 PMs. We contribute:
(1) PMs' current GenAI adoption rates, uses cases, and perceived benefits and
barriers and; (2) a framework capturing how PMs assess which tasks to delegate
to GenAI; (3) PMs adaptation practices for integrating GenAI into their roles
and perceptions of how their role is evolving. We end by discussing
implications on the broader GenAI workflow adoption process and software
development roles.

TL;DR: ZeroFalse框架结合静态分析和LLMs，显著减少SAST工具的误报，保持高覆盖率，适用于CI/CD管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少SAST工具中的误报，增强开发者信任，降低手动分类成本。

Method: ZeroFalse将静态分析器的输出视为结构化合约，通过流敏感追踪、上下文证据和CWE特定知识进行丰富，最后由LLM进行裁决。

Result: 在OWASP Java Benchmark和OpenVuln数据集上，最佳模型分别达到0.912和0.955的F1分数，召回率和精确率均超过90%。

Conclusion: ZeroFalse框架通过结合静态分析和大型语言模型（LLMs），显著减少了SAST工具中的误报，同时保持了高覆盖率，为实际CI/CD管道的集成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern
software development, yet their adoption is undermined by excessive false
positives that weaken developer trust and demand costly manual triage. We
present ZeroFalse, a framework that integrates static analysis with large
language models (LLMs) to reduce false positives while preserving coverage.
ZeroFalse treats static analyzer outputs as structured contracts, enriching
them with flow-sensitive traces, contextual evidence, and CWE-specific
knowledge before adjudication by an LLM. This design preserves the systematic
reach of static analysis while leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
We evaluate ZeroFalse across both benchmarks and real-world projects using ten
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our best-performing models achieve F1-scores of 0.912 on
the OWASP Java Benchmark and 0.955 on the OpenVuln dataset, maintaining recall
and precision above 90%. Results further show that CWE-specialized prompting
consistently outperforms generic prompts, and reasoning-oriented LLMs provide
the most reliable precision-recall balance. These findings position ZeroFalse
as a practical and scalable approach for enhancing the reliability of SAST and
supporting its integration into real-world CI/CD pipelines.

*Majid Dashtbani,Ladan Tahvildari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文通过分析微服务基准测试中的自动扩展问题，强调了生命周期感知工程对提升自动扩展性能的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往忽略了自动扩展的基础设计、实现和部署实践，难以在现实条件下评估自动扩展方法。

Method: 通过将多种先进的自动扩展方法应用于广泛使用的微服务基准测试，识别并分类了实践中的自动扩展考虑因素。

Result: 忽视关键生命周期问题会降低自动扩展器的性能，而解决这些问题则能带来更稳定和高效的扩展。

Conclusion: 生命周期感知工程对于充分发挥微服务系统中自动扩展的潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Microservices have become the dominant architectural paradigm for building
scalable and modular cloud-native systems. However, achieving effective
auto-scaling in such systems remains a non-trivial challenge, as it depends not
only on advanced scaling techniques but also on sound design, implementation,
and deployment practices. Yet, these foundational aspects are often overlooked
in existing benchmarks, making it difficult to evaluate autoscaling methods
under realistic conditions. In this paper, we identify a set of practical
auto-scaling considerations by applying several state-of-the-art autoscaling
methods to widely used microservice benchmarks. To structure these findings, we
classify the issues based on when they arise during the software lifecycle:
Architecture, Implementation, and Deployment. The Architecture phase covers
high-level decisions such as service decomposition and inter-service
dependencies. The Implementation phase includes aspects like initialization
overhead, metrics instrumentation, and error propagation. The Deployment phase
focuses on runtime configurations such as resource limits and health checks. We
validate these considerations using the Sock-Shop benchmark and evaluate
diverse auto-scaling strategies, including threshold-based, control-theoretic,
learning-based, black-box optimization, and dependency-aware approaches. Our
findings show that overlooking key lifecycle concerns can degrade autoscaler
performance, while addressing them leads to more stable and efficient scaling.
These results underscore the importance of lifecycle-aware engineering for
unlocking the full potential of auto-scaling in microservice-based systems.

TL;DR: RedCodeAgent是一种自动化红队代理，能系统发现代码代理的漏洞，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前静态安全基准和红队工具无法覆盖新兴的实际风险场景，如不同越狱工具的组合效应。

Method: 提出了RedCodeAgent，一种自动化红队代理，具备自适应记忆模块，能动态选择最有效的红队工具组合。

Result: 在多个先进代码代理、多样化风险场景和编程语言中，RedCodeAgent表现优于现有方法，攻击成功率高且拒绝率低。

Conclusion: RedCodeAgent通过自动化和优化红队流程，实现了对代码代理的可扩展、自适应且有效的安全评估。

Abstract: Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code
generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling
dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While
these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also
introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks
and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky
scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the
combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose
RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically
uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module,
RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the
most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox
for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise
be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox
environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents,
mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code.
Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents,
diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent
consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack
success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further
validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium,
exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing
red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective
safety assessments of code agents.

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入一种新型的代理驱动框架，整合了BIM数据提取与自动化验证，成功实现了建筑规范检查的自动化和高效化，为资源受限或农村地区的建筑官员提供了可扩展、可互操作且生产就绪的解决方案。

Abstract: Building officials, particularly those in resource-constrained or rural
jurisdictions, face labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly manual reviews of
design documents as projects increase in size and complexity. The growing
adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents opportunities for automated code review (ACR) solutions. This
study introduces a novel agent-driven framework that integrates BIM-based data
extraction with automated verification using both retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent pipelines. The
framework employs LLM-enabled agents to extract geometry, schedules, and system
attributes from heterogeneous file types, which are then processed for building
code checking through two complementary mechanisms: (1) direct API calls to the
US Department of Energy COMcheck engine, providing deterministic and
audit-ready outputs, and (2) RAG-based reasoning over rule provisions, enabling
flexible interpretation where coverage is incomplete or ambiguous.
  The framework was evaluated through case demonstrations, including automated
extraction of geometric attributes (such as surface area, tilt, and insulation
values), parsing of operational schedules, and validation of lighting
allowances under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2022. Comparative performance tests
across multiple LLMs showed that GPT-4o achieved the best balance of efficiency
and stability, while smaller models exhibited inconsistencies or failures.
Results confirm that MCP agent pipelines outperform RAG reasoning pipelines in
rigor and reliability. This work advances ACR research by demonstrating a
scalable, interoperable, and production-ready approach that bridges BIM with
authoritative code review tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DNN突变测试需要测试大量生成的突变体和大数据集，成本高昂。因此，需要一种高效的方法来加速这一过程。

Method: DM#利用傅里叶分析量化突变体行为，并通过聚类将相似行为的突变体分组。每组选一个代表进行测试，结果复用于其他突变体。

Result: DM#在14个不同规模的DNN模型上评估，平均加速28.38%，突变评分误差仅为0.72%。相比随机选择、边界样本选择和随机样本选择技术，DM#的误差分别减少了11.78、15.16和114.36倍。

Conclusion: DM#技术通过傅里叶分析和聚类方法显著加速了DNN突变测试，平均加速28.38%，且突变评分误差仅为0.72%。相比其他基线技术，DM#在误差和速度上表现更优。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) mutation analysis is a promising approach to
evaluating test set adequacy. Due to the large number of generated mutants that
must be tested on large datasets, mutation analysis is costly. In this paper,
we present a technique, named DM#, for accelerating DNN mutation testing using
Fourier analysis. The key insight is that DNN outputs are real-valued functions
suitable for Fourier analysis that can be leveraged to quantify mutant behavior
using only a few data points. DM# uses the quantified mutant behavior to
cluster the mutants so that the ones with similar behavior fall into the same
group. A representative from each group is then selected for testing, and the
result of the test, e.g., whether the mutant is killed or survived, is reused
for all other mutants represented by the selected mutant, obviating the need
for testing other mutants. 14 DNN models of sizes ranging from thousands to
millions of parameters, trained on different datasets, are used to evaluate DM#
and compare it to several baseline techniques. Our results provide empirical
evidence on the effectiveness of DM# in accelerating mutation testing by
28.38%, on average, at the average cost of only 0.72% error in mutation score.
Moreover, on average, DM# incurs 11.78, 15.16, and 114.36 times less mutation
score error compared to random mutant selection, boundary sample selection, and
random sample selection techniques, respectively, while generally offering
comparable speed-up.

Motivation: OpenID Connect虽广泛采用，但存在严重安全漏洞，导致财务损失和安全问题，亟需自动化修复方案。

Method: AuthFix采用反例引导的修复引擎，结合LLMs进行自动化OpenID漏洞修复，并利用基于Petri网的模型检查器确保补丁正确性。

Result: 在23个OpenID漏洞中，AuthFix成功为17个（74%）生成正确补丁，且大部分补丁与开发者编写的修复语义等效。

Conclusion: AuthFix通过结合故障定位、补丁合成和补丁验证三个关键组件，成功为OpenID漏洞生成正确补丁，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: OpenID Connect has revolutionized online authentication based on single
sign-on (SSO) by providing a secure and convenient method for accessing
multiple services with a single set of credentials. Despite its widespread
adoption, critical security bugs in OpenID Connect have resulted in significant
financial losses and security breaches, highlighting the need for robust
mitigation strategies. Automated program repair presents a promising solution
for generating candidate patches for OpenID implementations. However,
challenges such as domain-specific complexities and the necessity for precise
fault localization and patch verification must be addressed. We propose
AuthFix, a counterexample-guided repair engine leveraging LLMs for automated
OpenID bug fixing. AuthFix integrates three key components: fault localization,
patch synthesis, and patch verification. By employing a novel Petri-net-based
model checker, AuthFix ensures the correctness of patches by effectively
modeling interactions. Our evaluation on a dataset of OpenID bugs demonstrates
that AuthFix successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs
(74%), with a high proportion of patches semantically equivalent to
developer-written fixes.

Result: 编码器模块完成率为93.8%，硬件推荐模块能正确选择适合56量子位工作负载的设备，C2|Q>整体工作流成功处理了434个Python片段和100个JSON输入，完成率分别为93.8%和100%。相比手动实现，C2|Q>减少了近40倍的工作量。

Conclusion: C2|Q>通过模块化软件工程原则成功降低了量子软件开发的复杂性，使经典软件工程师能够更高效地开发量子程序，同时保持了方法论的严谨性。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging as a critical discipline to
make quantum computing accessible to a broader developer community; however,
most quantum development environments still require developers to engage with
low-level details across the software stack - including problem encoding,
circuit construction, algorithm configuration, hardware selection, and result
interpretation - making them difficult for classical software engineers to use.
To bridge this gap, we present C2|Q>: a hardware-agnostic quantum software
development framework that translates classical specifications (code) into
quantum-executable programs while preserving methodological rigor. The
framework applies modular software engineering principles by classifying the
workflow into three core modules: an encoder that classifies problems, produces
Quantum-Compatible Formats (QCFs), and constructs quantum circuits, a
deployment module that generates circuits and recommends hardware based on
fidelity, runtime, and cost, and a decoder that interprets quantum outputs into
classical solutions. In evaluation, the encoder module achieved a 93.8%
completion rate, the hardware recommendation module consistently selected the
appropriate quantum devices for workloads scaling up to 56 qubits, and the full
C2|Q>: workflow successfully processed classical specifications (434 Python
snippets and 100 JSON inputs) with completion rates of 93.8% and 100%,
respectively. For case study problems executed on publicly available NISQ
hardware, C2|Q>: reduced the required implementation effort by nearly 40X
compared to manual implementations using low-level quantum software development
kits (SDKs), with empirical runs limited to small- and medium-sized instances
consistent with current NISQ capabilities. The open-source implementation of

Result: 实验表明，GramTrans在多个基准测试中均显著优于基线表示形式，验证了解析难度与模型性能的强相关性。

Conclusion: GramTrans方法通过将上下文无关语言转换为LL(1)类表示，显著提升了代码生成模型的性能，验证了解析难度与模型性能之间的强相关性。

Abstract: Code generation has shown great promise in assisting software development. A
fundamental yet underexplored question is how the choice of code representation
affects model performance. While existing studies employ various
representations, such as treating code as plain text, grammar rule sequences,
or syntax tree sequences, they lack a principled understanding of the
relationship between parsing difficulty and model effectiveness. This paper
proposes a conjecture: the easier a representation is to parse, the better
performance the model achieves. We formalize this idea using grammar classes,
where representations in simpler classes (e.g., LL(1)) are easier to parse.
Through a controlled experiment on a Python-based DSL, we show that parsing
difficulty strongly correlates with model performance. Motivated by this
finding, we present GramTrans, a general approach that automatically transforms
a context-free language into a representation within the LL(1) class. GramTrans
introduces a novel hierarchical conflict elimination algorithm, enabling a
flexible trade-off between syntactic simplicity and token efficiency. We
evaluate GramTrans on both Python and Java using three code generation models:
StarCoder 1B, DeepSeek-Coder 1.3B, and Qwen2.5 1.5B. Across multiple
benchmarks, GramTrans consistently delivers significant improvements over
baseline representations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing representations
reconfirms the strong alignment between parsing difficulty and model
performance, providing additional support for the conjecture.

Result: 研究发现，代码正确性方向能可靠预测错误代码，纠正能力虽显著但需权衡。成功的代码生成依赖于关注测试用例而非问题描述，且基础模型中的方向在指令调优后仍有效。

Conclusion: 论文的结论表明，LLMs中的代码正确性方向能可靠预测错误代码，而纠正能力虽显著但需权衡错误修复与保留正确代码。成功的代码生成依赖于关注测试用例而非问题描述。此外，基础模型中识别的方向在指令调优后仍有效，表明预训练期间学习的代码正确性机制在微调中被重新利用。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become integral to software development, with
substantial portions of AI-suggested code entering production, understanding
their internal correctness mechanisms becomes critical for safe deployment. We
apply sparse autoencoders to decompose LLM representations, identifying
directions that correspond to code correctness. We select predictor directions
using t-statistics and steering directions through separation scores from base
model representations, then analyze their mechanistic properties through
steering, attention analysis, and weight orthogonalization. We find that code
correctness directions in LLMs reliably predict incorrect code, while
correction capabilities, though statistically significant, involve tradeoffs
between fixing errors and preserving correct code. Mechanistically, successful
code generation depends on attending to test cases rather than problem
descriptions. Moreover, directions identified in base models retain their
effectiveness after instruction-tuning, suggesting code correctness mechanisms
learned during pre-training are repurposed during fine-tuning. Our mechanistic
insights suggest three practical applications: prompting strategies should
prioritize test examples over elaborate problem descriptions, predictor
directions can serve as error alarms for developer review, and these same
predictors can guide selective steering, intervening only when errors are
anticipated to prevent the code corruption from constant steering.

Motivation: 确保LLM生成代码的正确性至关重要，但现有方法依赖预选层和标记位置，限制了其通用性。

Method: 引入AUTOPROBE，一种模型无关方法，通过基于注意力的机制动态选择最有信息量的内部表示，加权后传递给探测分类器预测代码正确性。

Conclusion: 动态选择重要内部信号使AUTOPROBE成为评估不同LLM生成代码正确性的稳健且通用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation and are increasingly integrated into the software development
process. However, ensuring the correctness of LLM-generated code remains a
critical concern. Prior work has shown that the internal representations of
LLMs encode meaningful signals for assessing code correctness. Nevertheless,
the existing methods rely on representations from pre-selected/fixed layers and
token positions, which could limit its generalizability across diverse model
architectures and tasks. In this work, we introduce AUTOPROBE, a novel
model-agnostic approach that dynamically selects the most informative internal
representations for code correctness assessment. AUTOPROBE employs an
attention-based mechanism to learn importance scores for hidden states,
enabling it to focus on the most relevant features. These weighted
representations are then aggregated and passed to a probing classifier to
predict code correctness across multiple dimensions, including compilability,
functionality, and security. To evaluate the performance of AUTOPROBE, we
conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and code LLMs. Our
experimental results show that AUTOPROBE consistently outperforms the
baselines. For security assessment, AUTOPROBE surpasses the state-of-the-art
white-box approach by 18%. For compilability and functionality assessment,
AUTOPROBE demonstrates its highest robustness to code complexity, with the
performance higher than the other approaches by up to 19% and 111%,
respectively. These findings highlight that dynamically selecting important
internal signals enables AUTOPROBE to serve as a robust and generalizable
solution for assessing the correctness of code generated by various LLMs.

Abstract: Observability helps ensure the reliability and maintainability of
cloud-native applications. As software architectures become increasingly
distributed and subject to change, it becomes a greater challenge to diagnose
system issues effectively, often having to deal with fragmented observability
and more difficult root cause analysis. This paper builds upon our previous
work and introduces three design patterns that address key challenges in
monitoring cloud-native applications. Distributed Tracing improves visibility
into request flows across services, aiding in latency analysis and root cause
detection, Application Metrics provides a structured approach to instrumenting
applications with meaningful performance indicators, enabling real-time
monitoring and anomaly detection, and Infrastructure Metrics focuses on
monitoring the environment in which the system is operated, helping teams
assess resource utilization, scalability, and operational health. These
patterns are derived from industry practices and observability frameworks and
aim to offer guidance for software practitioners.

Abstract: Higher education courses teaching about agile software development (ASD) have
increased in commonality as the ideas behind the Agile Manifesto became more
commonplace in the industry. However, a lot of the literature on how ASD is
applied in the classroom does not provide much actionable advice, focusing on
frameworks or even moving beyond the software development area into teaching in
an agile way. We, therefore, showcase early work on a pattern language that
focuses on teaching ASD practices to university students, which stems from our
own experiences as educators in higher education contexts. We present five
patterns, specifically focused on team and project setup phase: Capping Team
Size, Smaller Project Scope, Business Non-Critical Project, Self-assembling
Teams, and Team Chooses Topic as a starting point for developing the overall

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）越来越多地用于生成程序代码。关于生成代码的功能正确性已有大量研究报道，但关于代码质量的研究较少。本研究旨在提出一种基于场景的方法来评估LLM生成代码的质量，以确定代码质量最需要改进的最弱场景。

Method: 该方法通过测量代码异味（代码质量的重要指标）并与由专业编写代码的参考解决方案形成的基线进行比较。测试数据集根据代码主题和编码任务的复杂性分为多个子集，以代表使用LLM生成代码的不同场景。还提出了一个自动化测试系统，并报告了针对四种最先进LLM（Gemini Pro、ChatGPT、Codex和Falcon）生成的Java程序的实验。

Result: 研究发现，与参考解决方案相比，LLM生成的代码具有更高的代码异味发生率。Falcon表现最不差，异味增加42.28%，其次是Gemini Pro（62.07%）、ChatGPT（65.05%），最后是Codex（84.97%）。所有LLM的平均异味增加为63.34%，其中实现异味占73.35%，设计异味占21.42%。还发现，对于更复杂的编码任务和更高级的主题（如涉及面向对象概念的），代码异味的增加更大。

Conclusion: 从代码异味的角度来看，LLM在不同编码任务复杂度和主题上的表现与相应场景中人类编写代码的质量高度相关。然而，LLM生成的代码质量明显低于人类编写的代码。

Abstract: Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate
program code. Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of
generated code, but there is far less on code quality.
  Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating
the quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which
the quality of LLM generated code should be improved.
  Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code
quality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of
professionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets
according to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to
represent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also
present an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with
the Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four
state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.
  Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code
smells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with
a smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%)
and finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was
63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design
smells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more
complex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving
object-orientated concepts.
  Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding
task complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human
written code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM
generated code is noticeably poorer than human written code.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着组织从单体系统向微服务过渡，迁移过程仍然主要依赖手动且劳动密集型。现有文献主要关注架构级指导，忽略了代码级挑战和依赖关系。

Method: 本文介绍了七种重构方法的目录，这些方法旨在帮助开发者处理代码级依赖关系，并提供了系统化的迁移指南。

Result: 提出的重构目录为开发者提供了系统化的指导，填补了代码级系统化迁移的空白，并简化了迁移过程。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种包含七种重构方法的目录，专门用于支持向微服务架构的迁移，特别是处理依赖关系。通过提供结构化的逐步方法，这项工作简化了迁移过程，并为潜在自动化奠定了基础。

Abstract: As organizations increasingly transition from monolithic systems to
microservices, they aim to achieve higher availability, automatic scaling,
simplified infrastructure management, enhanced collaboration, and streamlined
deployments. However, this migration process remains largely manual and
labour-intensive. While existing literature offers various strategies for
decomposing monoliths, these approaches primarily focus on architecture-level
guidance, often overlooking the code-level challenges and dependencies that
developers must address during the migration. This article introduces a
catalogue of seven refactorings specifically designed to support the transition
to a microservices architecture with a focus on handling dependencies. The
catalogue provides developers with a systematic guide that consolidates
refactorings identified in the literature and addresses the critical gap in
systematizing the process at the code level. By offering a structured,
step-by-step approach, this work simplifies the migration process and lays the
groundwork for its potential automation, empowering developers to implement
these changes efficiently and effectively.

### [95] [State Field Coverage: A Metric for Oracle Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03071)
*Facundo Molina,Nazareno Aguirre,Alessandra Gorla*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出状态字段覆盖率作为评估测试预言质量的新度量标准，实验证明其与故障检测能力高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的度量标准要么无法全面指导预言改进，要么仅适用于特定类型的预言，限制了其通用性。因此，需要一种更通用的度量标准来评估预言质量。

Method: 本文通过静态计算状态字段覆盖率的方法，提出了一种新的度量标准。该方法高效，并能为改进测试预言提供直接指导，识别未被检查的状态字段。

Result: 通过涉及273个表示不变式和249,027个测试断言的实验评估，结果表明状态字段覆盖率与预言的故障检测能力（变异得分）有很强的相关性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的度量标准——状态字段覆盖率，用于评估测试预言的质量。实验证明，该度量标准与预言的故障检测能力（通过变异得分衡量）有很强的相关性，表明其适用于评估预言质量。

Abstract: The effectiveness of testing in uncovering software defects depends not only
on the characteristics of the test inputs and how thoroughly they exercise the
software, but also on the quality of the oracles used to determine whether the
software behaves as expected. Therefore, assessing the quality of oracles is
crucial to improve the overall effectiveness of the testing process. Existing
metrics have been used for this purpose, but they either fail to provide a
comprehensive basis for guiding oracle improvement, or they are tailored to
specific types of oracles, thus limiting their generality.
  In this paper, we introduce state field coverage, a novel metric for
assessing oracle quality. This metric measures the proportion of an object's
state, as statically defined by its class fields, that an oracle may access
during test execution. The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a
higher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software
under analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to
determine whether tests pass or not.
  We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage
metric. Being statically computed, the metric is efficient and provides direct
guidance for improving test oracles by identifying state fields that remain
unexamined. We evaluate state field coverage through experiments involving 273
representation invariants and 249,027 test assertions. The results show that
state field coverage is a well-suited metric for assessing oracle quality, as
it strongly correlates with the oracles' fault-detection ability, measured by
mutation score.

TL;DR: LLMs通过结构和命名理解代码，但命名记忆干扰评估。混淆方法揭示泄漏，新基准ClassEval-Obf提供更可靠评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs如何通过结构语义和命名通道理解代码，并揭示当前基准测试中命名模式记忆对性能评估的干扰。

Method: 引入了一套语义保持的混淆方法，并创建了ClassEval-Obf基准，用于系统性地抑制命名线索。

Result: 混淆方法暴露了命名泄漏现象，ClassEval-Obf基准减少了性能差距，削弱了记忆捷径，提供了更可靠的评估基础。

Conclusion: ClassEval-Obf基准通过消除命名线索，提供了一个更可靠的评估框架，揭示了当前LLMs在代码理解和泛化能力上的真实表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how
they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates
through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and
human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel
severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models
regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent
reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing
that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than
genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite
of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier
leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we
release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically
suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that
ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization
shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code
understanding and generalization.

TL;DR: 研究提出两种基于LLM的策略（错误弃权和补丁验证），以减少代理APR系统生成的噪音补丁，显著提高修复成功率，为工业级部署提供实用路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代理自动程序修复（APR）系统越来越多地处理工业中复杂的仓库级错误，生成的补丁仍需人工审查，以避免展示不太可能的补丁给开发者，减少噪音和信任侵蚀。

Method: 研究提出了两种互补的基于LLM的策略：错误弃权和补丁验证。错误弃权排除代理APR系统不太可能修复的错误，补丁验证则拒绝不太可能是良好修复的补丁。

Result: 在Google代码库的三组错误上评估这两种策略，结果显示结合使用可将成功率提高高达39个百分点。补丁验证还提高了机器生成错误报告的平均单样本成功率。

Conclusion: 通过引入错误弃权和补丁验证策略，研究为工业级代理自动程序修复（APR）系统的可靠部署提供了实用路径，显著提高了修复成功率。

Abstract: Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex,
repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still
need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address
the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise,
wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We
introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug
abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the
agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that
are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on
three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches
generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported
bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise
success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points,
respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer
exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports,
patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This
two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale
deployment of agentic APR systems.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: NetCAS通过动态I/O分割和实时网络反馈优化远程存储性能，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着性能差距缩小，同时访问缓存和后端设备可提升吞吐量，但网络竞争使得远程存储的I/O分割复杂化。

Method: NetCAS采用基于实时网络反馈和预计算性能配置文件的动态I/O分割策略，结合低开销的批量轮询调度器。

Result: NetCAS在远程存储环境中性能提升高达174%，在网络波动条件下优于Orthus等方案3.5倍。

Conclusion: NetCAS通过动态调整I/O分割比例，显著提升了远程存储环境下的性能表现，优于传统缓存和现有方案。

Abstract: Modern storage systems often combine fast cache with slower backend devices
to accelerate I/O. As performance gaps narrow, concurrently accessing both
devices, rather than relying solely on cache hits, can improve throughput.
However, in data centers, remote backend storage accessed over networks suffers
from unpredictable contention, complicating this split. We present NetCAS, a
framework that dynamically splits I/O between cache and backend devices based
on real-time network feedback and a precomputed Perf Profile. Unlike
traditional hit-rate-based policies, NetCAS adapts split ratios to workload
configuration and networking performance. NetCAS employs a low-overhead batched
round-robin scheduler to enforce splits, avoiding per-request costs. It
achieves up to 174% higher performance than traditional caching in remote
storage environments and outperforms converging schemes like Orthus by up to
3.5X under fluctuating network conditions.

Motivation: 传统二维屏幕投影和鼠标键盘交互限制了用户的空间理解和自然交互能力，ERUPT旨在通过XR技术解决这些问题。

Method: ERUPT集成了MoveIt运动规划框架，支持用户在沉浸式三维XR环境中动态创建和调整环境，并通过多种交互模态与虚拟机器人互动。

Result: 用户能够在虚拟环境中安全规划机器人路径，并可视化运动轨迹，最终将规划路径部署到实际机器人上。

Conclusion: ERUPT系统通过XR技术实现了交互式运动规划，显著提升了用户的空间理解和自然交互能力，同时确保了虚拟环境中的安全规划和实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot
paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater
spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction
capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment
similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the
scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates
with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion
planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or
augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing
users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot.
Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired
behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions
within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in
the real world.

Motivation: 现有驾驶场景编辑框架因编辑能力有限而难以高效生成真实场景，SIMSplat旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用语言控制的高斯泼溅重建技术，支持详细的对象级编辑，包括添加新对象和修改轨迹，并结合多智能体运动预测进行路径优化。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上的实验表明，SIMSplat具有广泛的编辑能力和场景适应性。

Conclusion: SIMSplat通过语言对齐的高斯泼溅技术，提供了一种高效且直观的驾驶场景编辑方法，显著提升了场景编辑的灵活性和真实性。

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在动态环境中操作时，感知数据可能延迟、噪声或过时，需要一种能够在执行过程中灵活调整目标的方法。

Method: 提出了UAR-PF（不确定性感知重定向器），通过维持物体姿态的分布并选择最大化预期进展的目标，解决了感知滞后问题。

Result: 在PyBullet/PandaGym的Shift x Lag压力测试中，UAR-PF和ICP相较于无重定向基线，表现出更高的成功率和更少的终止操作。

Conclusion: U-LAG（UAR-PF）作为一种可插拔的模块，能够在感知和控制之间实现飞行中的目标重定向，显著提高了机器人在动态环境中的操作成功率。

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

Abstract: We are interested in solving the problem of imitation learning with a limited
amount of real-world expert data. Existing offline imitation methods often
struggle with poor data coverage and severe performance degradation. We propose
a solution that leverages robot simulators to achieve online imitation
learning. Our sim-to-real framework is based on world models and combines
online imitation pretraining with offline finetuning. By leveraging online
interactions, our approach alleviates the data coverage limitations of offline
methods, leading to improved robustness and reduced performance degradation
during finetuning. It also enhances generalization during domain transfer. Our
empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness, improving success rates by at
least 31.7% in sim-to-sim transfer and 23.3% in sim-to-real transfer over
existing offline imitation learning baselines.

Conclusion: Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference 显著降低了上行传输和服务器操作，同时保持了高任务成功率。

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

Motivation: Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints.

Method: We deploy extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman realizations from input-state data. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine the optimal robot action in an MPC framework.

Result: Our approach is capable of finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.

Conclusion: Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to linear problems.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the

linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual
environments to significantly improve remote situational awareness and mission
performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in the
field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在受限机器人（如空中机械臂）上部署通用操纵策略时，因控制和机器人动力学不匹配导致的行为异常和执行效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出了Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP)，通过将控制器的梯度反馈融入扩散采样过程，生成动态可行的轨迹。

Result: 在多个长时程和高精度空中操纵任务中验证了方法的有效性，相比未引导的扩散基线，提高了成功率、效率和抗干扰能力。

Conclusion: UMI-on-Air框架通过结合高层次的UMI策略和低层次的特定控制器，实现了在受限机器人上的可扩展部署，展示了在多样化和高度受限环境中的实用性。

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on
dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach
delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, all while operating in near real-time. The source code is publicly
available.

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a
piecewise linear trajectory without prior knowledge of the system dynamics.
Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

Conclusion: 论文提出的轨迹生成框架显著提高了代理密度和行为多样性，同时保持了运动真实性和场景安全性，其合成数据对下游轨迹预测模型有益。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法（如 A* 和 LLM-A*）在大型地图上存在高计算时间和内存消耗的问题，iLLM-A* 旨在解决这些瓶颈。

Method: iLLM-A* 结合了 A* 算法的优化、LLM 的增量学习方法以及高质量路径点的选择机制。

Conclusion: iLLM-A* 在大型网格地图上显著提升了路径规划的效率，包括速度、内存消耗和路径质量。

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架通过结合力信息数据和合规策略，显著提升了视觉运动策略在接触丰富任务中的性能，并在真实机器人任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

Motivation: 传统的开环FES控制器采用固定刺激强度，存在过度刺激或刺激不足的风险，可能导致肌肉疲劳或增加跌倒风险。

Method: 通过诱导健康参与者出现足下垂，并在不同步行条件下（包括不同速度和地面倾斜度）比较闭环控制器与传统开环控制器的效果。

Result: 运动学数据显示，闭环控制器在保持足够脚趾间隙的同时，显著降低了刺激强度，且未显著影响髋、膝和踝关节的角度。

Conclusion: 提出的闭环FES控制器不仅保持了足够的脚趾间隙，还显著降低了刺激强度，有望减少肌肉疲劳并提高长期用户舒适度和依从性。

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

Conclusion: 目前的数值指标虽然能捕捉到机器人导航行为的某些方面，但重要的主观因素仍未充分体现，需要开发新的指标。

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种最小配置的臂行机器人完整机电设计，并通过实验验证了连续控制策略的有效性。

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Motivation: To accurately estimate the position and orientation of flexible manipulators undergoing vertical motion, addressing noise and delay issues in IMU measurements.

Method: The framework models flexible links as rigid segments, uses cost-effective IMUs for accelerometer and gyroscope measurements, and employs a complementary filter optimized via PSO. Residual errors are compensated using RBFNN.

Result: Experimental results show high accuracy with RMSE values of 0.00021 m (y), 0.00041 m (z), and 0.00024 rad (θ).

Conclusion: The proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation method effectively estimates the position and orientation of flexible manipulators, achieving high accuracy with RMSE values of 0.00021 m, 0.00041 m, and 0.00024 rad for y, z, and θ, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for estimating the position and
orientation of flexible manipulators undergoing vertical motion using multiple
inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth
data. The flexible links are modeled as a series of rigid segments, with joint
angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the
measurements, with its parameters optimized through particle swarm optimization
(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and
0.00024~rad for $y$, $z$, and $\theta$, respectively.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架在实时最优控制重型滑移转向移动平台的轨迹跟踪方面表现出色，显著优于现有文献中的非线性模型预测控制器。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to
prior methods. The link to our code can be found

Conclusion: HumanoidExo 是一种高效的系统，能够将人类动作转化为全身人形机器人数据，显著提升了人形机器人在动态现实场景中的性能。

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest
accuracy overall. Project code is available at

Conclusion: 本文提出协同设计作为开发下一代智能和适应性人形机器人的基石，并提出了从短期创新到长期目标的开放研究问题。

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

Conclusion: 该研究通过仿生触须传感装置，为微型无人机提供了无需视觉的导航能力，拓展了其在极端环境中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种直接从轨迹数据中学习Lyapunov函数的新框架，无需详细系统模型即可为自主系统提供稳定性认证，为机器人在动态现实环境中的安全性提供了鲁棒性保障。

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型和多视角导航数据，展示了在合成和真实环境中强大的泛化能力，并证明了学生模型超越RL教师的潜力。

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉规划中表现出潜力，但在空间和长时程推理上存在不足。PDDL规划器擅长长时程规划，但无法处理视觉输入。结合两者优势的现有方法依赖人工预定义或环境访问，限制了自主性。

Conclusion: VLMFP框架通过双VLM引导，成功解决了视觉语言模型在生成PDDL领域文件时的准确性难题，实现了视觉规划问题的自主文件生成，并在不同实例、外观和规则中展现了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

Conclusion: BrowserArena的创新基准方法为大规模评估和理解网络代理的失败模式提供了途径，揭示了当前网络代理的多样性和脆弱性。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent

Conclusion: RefineShot的引入解决了ShotBench和ShotVL的评估可靠性问题，为电影摄影理解的未来发展提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上实现显著的性能提升和计算效率增益。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的方法，通过动态早期退出预测和修改后的DFRC技术，有效控制有害上下文示例对模型性能的影响，同时提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

TL;DR: The study identifies and manipulates specific attention heads in LMMs to improve relational task performance, showcasing modular knowledge encoding and enhanced control over reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms supporting in-context learning abilities in LMMs and enhance control over relational reasoning.

Method: Using causal mediation analysis, the study identifies attention heads influencing relational predictions and extracts multimodal function vectors. These vectors are fine-tuned with minimal training data while keeping LMM parameters frozen.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms in-context learning baselines and demonstrates strong generalization ability by solving analogy problems involving novel spatial relations.

Conclusion: LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which can be systematically extracted and optimized, enhancing control over relational reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

TL;DR: FM在跨模态冲突中表现差，主要因注意力不平衡；显式结合多模态训练可改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FM在多模态联合推理中的表现，尤其是在模态间存在冲突时，探究FM是否能进行联合推理或偏向某一模态。

Method: 通过实验研究FM在跨模态冲突中的表现，分析跨模态注意力不平衡问题，并提出一种简单可扩展的方法，即在每个训练实例中显式结合多模态。

Result: FM在单模态冲突中表现良好（90%识别率），但在跨模态冲突中表现极差（低至3%识别率），跨模态注意力不平衡是主要原因。显式结合多模态训练方法能显著减少注意力不平衡并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Foundation models (FMs) 需要系统性地处理跨模态上下文以构建可靠的模型，简单的显式结合多模态训练方法可显著减少注意力不平衡并提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

TL;DR: 温度缩放比单一温度测试时缩放更有效，能释放基础模型的潜力，性能接近RL训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，增加样本数量K会提高准确性，但这种趋势不会无限持续，某些难题无论如何增加样本数量仍无法解决。不同采样温度可以解决不同子集的问题，这意味着单一温度缩放仅探索了模型潜力的一部分。

Method: 提出沿温度维度进行缩放，并设计了一种多温度投票方法以减少温度缩放的开销。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，温度缩放比单一温度TTS平均提高了7.3个百分点，并使基础模型性能接近经过RL训练的模型。

Conclusion: 温度缩放是一种简单有效的方法，可以释放基础模型的潜在能力，使其性能接近经过强化学习训练的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

Method: 论文采用了一种新的可能性概念，基于事件的前提条件和约束的概率计算。该方法与Zadeh的标准概念形式不同，但都采用了Łukasiewicz多值逻辑连接词的解释。

Result: 提出了一个专门用于计算事件可能性的新理论，并通过车辆路线规划的示例展示了其应用。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个新的可能性概念，专注于现实世界事件的可能性，并通过计算前提条件和约束的概率来量化事件的可行性。这一理论特别适用于规划问题，如选择最可行的计划。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design

AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover

on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing

Method: 提出了ARMs自适应红队代理，采用推理增强的多步编排优化多样化红队策略，并设计了分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法以平衡攻击多样性和有效性。

Result: ARMs在实例和政策基准测试中达到SOTA攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，并在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建的ARMs-Bench数据集包含30K红队实例，覆盖51种风险类别。

Conclusion: ARMs显著提升了VLM的安全评估能力，通过自动化和多样化的红队策略，有效揭示了新兴漏洞，并构建了大规模安全数据集ARMs-Bench，为多模态安全对齐提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Result: 在公共数据集上，NCV相比基线方法（如基于CoT的验证器）F1分数提高了10%至25%，同时令牌使用量减少了6倍至58倍。

Conclusion: NCV提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，用于可靠地验证大型语言模型的多步推理，显著提高了F1分数并减少了令牌使用量。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个多维评估框架，通过证据库分析工具增强LLM代理的推理轨迹，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法局限于答案匹配，无法全面评估代理的问题解决轨迹，如效率、幻觉和适应性。

Method: 提出TRACE框架，结合证据库和多维评估方法，对代理的推理轨迹进行全面分析。

Result: TRACE在实验中准确评估了复杂行为，且在小规模开源LLM上也表现良好，揭示了未报告的观察和见解。

Conclusion: TRACE框架通过引入证据库和多维评估方法，有效解决了工具增强LLM代理性能评估的局限性，并在实验中验证了其准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

*Antoine Maier,Aude Maier,Tom David*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出机器学习中‘目标满足假设’（OSA）在现实条件下不成立，优化误差和意图误配会导致系统性偏差，可能引发失控风险，因此需限制优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨机器学习中一个常见但鲜少被检验的假设——训练模型能够满足其指定的目标函数（OSA），并揭示其在现实条件下的失效及其潜在风险。

Method: 通过一个学习范式无关的框架，分析了近似、估计和优化误差如何导致系统性地偏离预期目标，并结合数学结果探讨了这些偏差与Goodhart定律失效模式的关系。

Result: 研究表明，OSA在现实条件下无法实现，且缺乏对这些偏差的数学描述时，它们与Goodhart定律的失效模式难以区分，因此需要限制优化以避免失控。

Conclusion: 由于客观满足假设（OSA）在现实条件下无法实现，且无法预先确定Goodhart崩溃点，因此需要对通用人工智能系统的优化施加原则性限制，以避免不可控的后果。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BayesianRouter是一个混合路由框架，通过离线学习和在线贝叶斯选择优化RM路由，显著提升LLM对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RM路由方法存在冷启动和探索不足的问题，限制了大型语言模型对齐的质量和稳定性。

Method: 提出BayesianRouter框架，包括离线阶段的多任务路由器训练和在线阶段的贝叶斯Thompson采样路由器进行RM选择。

Result: 在指令跟随（AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench）和推理（GSM8K, MMLU）基准测试中，BayesianRouter表现优于单个RM、RM集成和其他路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，显著提升了对齐质量，避免了过拟合，并在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Motivation: 优化带有奖励的离散扩散模型（DDM）存在挑战，非自回归范式使得重要性采样难以处理且rollout复杂，这困扰了如GRPO等强化学习方法。

Method: 研究首先澄清了离散扩散模型（DDM）的理论基础，构建了一个能够捕捉有价值令牌波动的重要性估计器，并针对视觉序列精心定制了rollout方法，以产生多样化的完成和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编码和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来了更稳定和高效的更新。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了MaskGRPO作为一种系统性策略优化方法，并首次实现了离散化视觉扩散的实际应用，展示了更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Motivation: 尽管反事实解释在可解释人工智能（XAI）中是一个强大的工具，但在基于规则的智能环境中尚无成熟的方法生成此类解释。

Method: 本文首次为基于规则的智能环境领域定制了反事实解释的正式化和实现，并将其作为插件扩展了现有的解释引擎。通过用户研究（N=17）评估了生成的反事实解释与传统因果解释的效果。

Result: 用户研究表明，用户偏好高度依赖情境：因果解释因其语言简单性和时间压力情境更受青睐，而反事实解释则因其可操作内容在解决问题时更受欢迎。

Conclusion: 本研究为智能环境中的反事实解释提供了一个实用的框架，并通过实证证据指导了何时选择哪种解释类型最有效。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Motivation: 探讨现代AI系统在训练不完整条件下的泛化能力，以验证其是否真正具备推理能力或仅依赖统计捷径。

Method: 研究通过故意在训练中遗漏部分结构规则，评估了序列到序列的Transformer模型和视觉架构（如CoPINet和Dual-Contrast Network）在I-RAVEN数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验显示，Transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但对新规则或遗漏规则的准确性显著下降。此外，token级准确性与完整答案准确性之间的差距暴露了当前方法的根本局限。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前深度学习模型在抽象推理上的局限性，强调了需要超越模式识别、实现更稳健的抽象推理的架构设计。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied

effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent

addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains

<details>

Motivation: 尽管连续扩散模型在理论上比离散扩散模型和循环变压器更具表达力，但其实际性能较差，主要原因是解码连续表示到离散标记空间的困难。

Method: 提出了Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion（CCDD）方法，定义了一个联合多模态扩散过程，利用单一模型在联合空间中进行去噪，并设计了有效的架构和高级训练/采样技术。

Result: CCDD在真实世界的语言建模实验中表现出强大的性能，证明了其在表达能力和样本质量上的优势。

Conclusion: Continuous diffusion models（CCDD）通过结合连续和离散空间的联合扩散过程，展现出了更强的表达能力和更好的训练性能，实际应用中在语言建模任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的水平扩展和垂直扩展策略在应对突发性、短时流量模式时存在粒度粗、延迟高、成本过高等问题，无法满足动态云环境需求。

Method: ElasticMoE 框架包括 HBM 管理模块（HMM）和基于虚拟内存的专家重分配机制，通过零拷贝重映射和对等高速传输实现扩展。

Result: 在 Ascend NPU 上的评估显示，ElasticMoE 实现了高达 9 倍的扩展延迟降低和 2 倍的吞吐提升，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ElasticMoE 通过解耦推理执行和内存操作，实现了细粒度、低延迟、零停机的扩展，显著提升了大规模 MoE LLM 在动态云环境中的实用性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models promise efficient scaling of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of experts per token, but their
parallelized inference pipelines make elastic serving challenging. Existing
strategies fall short: horizontal scaling provisions entire replicas of the
current configuration, often tens to hundreds of accelerators, leading to
coarse granularity, long provisioning delays, and costly overprovisioning.
Vertical scaling offers finer adjustments but typically requires instance
restarts, incurring downtime. These limitations make current approaches
ill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud
deployments.
  We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that
achieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling. ElasticMoE
decouples inference execution from memory operations, enabling scaling steps to
proceed concurrently with serving. An HBM Management Module (HMM) reuses
weights and KV caches via zero-copy remapping, while high-bandwidth
peer-to-peer transfers bring newly added accelerators online without
interrupting service. A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism
migrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory
usage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.
  Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that
ElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput
during scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to
baselines. By enabling fine-grained, concurrent scaling with minimal
disruption, ElasticMoE advances the practicality of deploying massive MoE LLMs
in dynamic cloud environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据量和维度的增加，RNN-Descent的图构建复杂度急剧上升，导致时间消耗大幅增加，影响后续查询处理效率。

Method: GRNND引入了无序邻居传播策略以减少同步更新陷阱，利用warp级协作操作和固定容量的双缓冲邻居池优化内存访问和并行邻居更新。

Result: GRNND在实验中表现优异，相比现有GPU方法实现了2.4至51.7倍的加速，相比CPU方法实现了17.8至49.8倍的加速。

Conclusion: GRNND通过无序邻居传播策略、warp级协作操作和双缓冲邻居池等技术，显著提升了RNN-Descent在GPU上的并行效率，实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Relative Nearest Neighbor Descent (RNN-Descent) is a state-of-the-art
algorithm for constructing sparse approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) graphs by
combining the iterative refinement of NN-Descent with the edge-pruning rules of
the Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG). It has demonstrated strong effectiveness
in large-scale search tasks such as information retrieval and related tasks.
However, as the amount and dimensionality of data increase, the complexity of
graph construction in RNN-Descent rises sharply, making this stage increasingly
time-consuming and even prohibitive for subsequent query processing. In this
paper, we propose GRNND, the first GPU-parallel algorithm of RNN-Descent
designed to fully exploit GPU architecture. GRNND introduces a disordered
neighbor propagation strategy to mitigate synchronized update traps, enhancing
structural diversity, and avoiding premature convergence during parallel
execution. It also leverages warp-level cooperative operations and a
double-buffered neighbor pool with fixed capacity for efficient memory access,
eliminate contention, and enable highly parallelized neighbor updates.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRNND consistently outperforms existing
CPU- and GPU-based methods. GRNND achieves 2.4 to 51.7x speedup over existing
GPU methods, and 17.8 to 49.8x speedup over CPU methods.

Motivation: 当前静态、手动、管道级的服务范式在资源分配上效率低下，无法适应不同阶段和请求的资源需求差异。

Method: 提出了动态阶段级服务范式，并开发了TridentServe系统，自动动态地制定管道部署的放置计划和请求处理的路由计划。

Result: 实验表明，TridentServe在各种工作负载下均能提升SLO达成率，并将平均/P95延迟降低至2.5倍和3.6倍/4.1倍。

Conclusion: TridentServe通过动态阶段级服务范式显著提升了扩散管道的服务效率，优化了资源分配，实现了更高的SLO达成率和更低的延迟。

Abstract: Diffusion pipelines, renowned for their powerful visual generation
capabilities, have seen widespread adoption in generative vision tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image/video). These pipelines typically follow an
encode--diffuse--decode three-stage architecture. Current serving systems
deploy diffusion pipelines within a static, manual, and pipeline-level
paradigm, allocating the same resources to every request and stage. However,
through an in-depth analysis, we find that such a paradigm is inefficient due
to the discrepancy in resource needs across the three stages of each request,
as well as across different requests. Following the analysis, we propose the
dynamic stage-level serving paradigm and develop TridentServe, a brand new
diffusion serving system. TridentServe automatically, dynamically derives the
placement plan (i.e., how each stage resides) for pipeline deployment and the
dispatch plan (i.e., how the requests are routed) for request processing,
co-optimizing the resource allocation for both model and requests. Extensive
experiments show that TridentServe consistently improves SLO attainment and
reduces average/P95 latencies by up to 2.5x and 3.6x/4.1x over existing works
across a variety of workloads.

Abstract: We investigate the energy efficiency of a library designed for parallel
computations with sparse matrices. The library leverages high-performance,
energy-efficient Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators to enable
large-scale scientific applications. Our primary development objective was to
maximize parallel performance and scalability in solving sparse linear systems
whose dimensions far exceed the memory capacity of a single node. To this end,
we devised methods that expose a high degree of parallelism while optimizing
algorithmic implementations for efficient multi-GPU usage. Previous work has
already demonstrated the library's performance efficiency on large-scale
systems comprising thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, achieving improvements over
state-of-the-art solutions. In this paper, we extend those results by providing
energy profiles that address the growing sustainability requirements of modern
HPC platforms. We present our methodology and tools for accurate runtime energy
measurements of the library's core components and discuss the findings. Our
results confirm that optimizing GPU computations and minimizing data movement
across memory and computing nodes reduces both time-to-solution and energy
consumption. Moreover, we show that the library delivers substantial advantages

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data volumes are rapidly increasing. While cloud
computing are now used for processing large EO datasets, the energy efficiency
aspects of such a processing have received much less attention. This issue is
notable given the increasing awareness of energy costs and carbon footprint in
big data processing, particularly with increased attention on compute-intensive
foundation models. In this paper we identify gaps in energy efficiency
practices within cloud-based EO big data (EOBD) processing and propose several
research directions for improvement. We first examine the current EOBD
landscape, focus on the requirements that necessitate cloud-based processing
and analyze existing cloud-based EOBD solutions. We then investigate energy
efficiency strategies that have been successfully employed in well-studied big
data domains. Through this analysis, we identify several critical gaps in
existing EOBD processing platforms, which primarily focus on data accessibility
and computational feasibility, instead of energy efficiency. These gaps include
insufficient energy monitoring mechanisms, lack of energy awareness in data
management, inadequate implementation of energy-aware resource allocation and
lack of energy efficiency criteria on task scheduling. Based on these findings,
we propose the development of energy-aware performance monitoring and
benchmarking frameworks, the use of optimization techniques for infrastructure
orchestration, and of energy-efficient task scheduling approaches for
distributed cloud-based EOBD processing frameworks. These proposed approaches
aim to foster more energy awareness in EOBD processing , potentially reducing
power consumption and environmental impact while maintaining or minimally
impacting processing performance.

Abstract: The intelligent Distributed Dispatch and Scheduling (iDDS) service is a
versatile workflow orchestration system designed for large-scale, distributed
scientific computing. iDDS extends traditional workload and data management by
integrating data-aware execution, conditional logic, and programmable
workflows, enabling automation of complex and dynamic processing pipelines.
Originally developed for the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider,
iDDS has evolved into an experiment-agnostic platform that supports both
template-driven workflows and a Function-as-a-Task model for Python-based
orchestration.
  This paper presents the architecture and core components of iDDS,
highlighting its scalability, modular message-driven design, and integration
with systems such as PanDA and Rucio. We demonstrate its versatility through
real-world use cases: fine-grained tape resource optimization for ATLAS,
orchestration of large Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) workflows for the Rubin
Observatory, distributed hyperparameter optimization for machine learning
applications, active learning for physics analyses, and AI-assisted detector
design at the Electron-Ion Collider.
  By unifying workload scheduling, data movement, and adaptive decision-making,
iDDS reduces operational overhead and enables reproducible, high-throughput
workflows across heterogeneous infrastructures. We conclude with current
challenges and future directions, including interactive, cloud-native, and
serverless workflow support.
