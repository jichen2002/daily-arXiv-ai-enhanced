Traditional\nground station selection typically begins by choosing from a fixed set of\nlocations offered by Ground Station-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers, which helps\nreduce the problem scope to optimizing locations over existing infrastructure.\nHowever, finding a globally optimal solution for stations using existing\nmixed-integer programming methods quickly becomes intractable at scale,\nespecially when considering multiple providers and large satellite\nconstellations. To address this issue, we introduce a scalable, hierarchical\nframework that decomposes the global selection problem into single-satellite,\nshort time-window subproblems. Optimal station choices from each subproblem are\nclustered to identify consistently high-value locations across all decomposed\ncases. Cluster-level sets are then matched back to the closest GSaaS candidate\nsites to produce a globally feasible solution.

Geometric mechanics provides a framework to model and\noptimize such systems in highly damped environments, connecting a prescribed\nshape change pattern (gait) with locomotion displacement.

In this work, we extend geometric\nmechanics to predict locomotor performance and search for optimal swimming\nstrategy of compliant undulators. We introduce a compliant extension of\nPurcell's three-link swimmer by incorporating series-connected springs at the\njoints. Body dynamics are derived with resistive force theory. Geometric\nmechanics is incorporated into movement prediction and into an optimization\nframework that identifies strategies for controlling compliant swimmers to\nachieve maximal displacement.

The goal is to estimate the\ndiameter of this multiset, defined as $\\max\\{\\mathsf{d}(i,j) : x_i, x_j > 0\\}$,\nto a specified approximation factor while using as little space as possible.\n  In insertion-only streams, a simple $O(\\log n)$-space algorithm achieves a\n2-approximation. In sharp contrast to this, we show that in the dynamic\nstreaming model, any algorithm achieving a constant-factor approximation to\ndiameter requires polynomial space.

As foveation\nlevels increase, the rendering quality is reduced, and traditional foveated\nrendering systems tend not to preserve samples that were previously rendered at\nhigh spatial resolution in previous frames. Additionally, prior research has\nshown that saccade landing positions are distributed around a target location\nrather than landing at a single point, and that even during fixations, eyes\nperform small microsaccades around a fixation point. This creates an\nopportunity for sampling from temporally neighbouring frames with differing\nfoveal locations to reduce the required rendered size of the foveal region\nwhile achieving a higher perceived image quality. We further observe that the\ntemporal presentation of pixels frame-to-frame can be viewed as a data stream,\npresenting a random sampling problem. Following this intuition, we propose a\nWeighted Reservoir Sampling technique to efficiently maintain a reservoir of\nthe perceptually relevant high quality pixel samples from previous frames and\nincorporate them into the computation of the current frame. This allows the\nrenderer to render a smaller region of foveal pixels per frame by temporally\nreusing pixel samples that are still relevant to reconstruct a higher perceived\nimage quality, while allowing for higher levels of foveation. Our method\noperates on the output of foveated rendering, and runs in under 1\\,ms at 4K\nresolution, making it highly efficient and integrable with real-time VR and AR\nfoveated rendering systems."}

Among these challenges, Self-Admitted Technical Debt\n(SATD) has emerged as a growing concern, significantly impacting the\nmaintainability and overall quality of ML and DL-enabled systems. Despite its\ncritical implications, the lifecycle of DL-specific SATD, how developers\nintroduce, acknowledge, and address it over time-remains underexplored. This\nstudy presents a preliminary analysis of the persistence and lifecycle of\nDL-specific SATD in DL-enabled systems. The purpose of this project is to\nuncover the patterns of SATD introduction, recognition, and durability during\nthe development life cycle, providing information on how to manage these\nissues. Using mining software repository techniques, we examined 40 ML\nprojects, focusing on 185 DL-specific SATD instances. The analysis tracked the\nintroduction and persistence of SATD instances through project commit histories\nto assess their lifecycle and developer actions. The findings indicate that\nDL-specific SATD is predominantly introduced during the early and middle stages\nof project development. Training and Hardware phases showed the longest SATD\ndurations, highlighting critical areas where debt accumulates and persists.\nAdditionally, developers introduce DL-specific SATD more frequently during\nfeature implementation and bug fixes. This study emphasizes the need for\ntargeted DL-specific SATD management strategies in DL-enabled systems to\nmitigate its impact. By understanding the temporal characteristics and\nevolution of DL-specific SATD, developers can prioritize interventions at\ncritical stages to improve the maintainability and quality of the system."}

To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA)\nframework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories,\nthereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory\nfine-tuning.

However,\ndelivering accurate highlighting in real time remains challenging for online\nand web-based development tools due to strict time and memory constraints on\nbackend services.

This has led to on-the-fly syntax\nhighlighting, where visual annotations are generated just before content is\nserved, often at high request rates and under incomplete input conditions. To\nmeet these demands efficiently, state-of-the-art models use deep learning to\nlearn the behavior of brute-force syntax highlighting resolvers, tools that are\neasy to implement but too slow for production. Through the Deep Abstraction\nprocess, brute-force strategies are encoded into fast statistical models that\nachieve both high accuracy and low-latency inference.

Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes\nperformance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining\naccurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven\nalternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on\nhand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal\npolicies directly from interaction data.

One of the simplest approaches to eliciting more\naccurate answers is to select the mode of many responses, a technique known as\nensembling. In this work, we expand on typical ensembling approaches by looking\nat ensembles with a variable voting threshold. We introduce a theoretical\nframework for question answering and show that, by permitting ensembles to\n\"abstain\" from providing an answer when the dominant response falls short of\nthe threshold, it is possible to dramatically increase the trustworthiness of\nthe remaining answers. From this framework, we derive theoretical results as\nwell as report experimental results on two problem domains: arithmetic problem\nsolving and clinical-note question-answering. In both domains, we observe that\nlarge gains in answer trustworthiness can be achieved using highly restrictive\nvoting ensembles, while incurring relatively modest reductions in response\nyield and accuracy. Due to this quality, voting ensembles may be particularly\nuseful in applications - such as healthcare and data annotation - that require\na high degree of certainty but which may not require that every question\nreceive an automated answer."}

For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each,\nderive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on\nhardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip\nlimits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an\neight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg\nprovides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke\ndouble rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far\nricher gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we\nused deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored\nspace. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under\nthe right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that\nTARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple\npreviously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search\nis likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and\nreinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics."}

A\npromising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories\nbeyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via\nneural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and\ncostly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that\nphotorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is\nsemantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,\nnot textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which\nreplaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated\nprimitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers\nand cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively\nto real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment\nthat bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization\nAugmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.\nRAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail\ngeneralization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo\nOpen Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive.

This paper argues that such developments pose a\nfundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.\nConsciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical\nevidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides\nevidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent\nepistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate\nrequirements, or origin.

To\nalleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM\nagents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract,\nutilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance\nof LMM agents. Recognizing that traditional contract design methods cannot\neffectively adapt to the dynamic environment of Web 3.0, we develop an improved\nMixture of Experts (MoE)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for\noptimal contract design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed MoE-based PPO algorithm over representative benchmarks in the context\nof contract design.

Existing methods, whether\nreconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based\n(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level\nmatching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely\noverlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal\nRGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D\nand RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.\nDespite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a\ncomprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate\nunified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching\nperspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a\ngeneric post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any\nUAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against\nnormal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable\nfiltering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,\nmitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive\nexperiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in\nenhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art\nresults in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD\nscenarios.

Traditional\nground station selection typically begins by choosing from a fixed set of\nlocations offered by Ground Station-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers, which helps\nreduce the problem scope to optimizing locations over existing infrastructure.\nHowever, finding a globally optimal solution for stations using existing\nmixed-integer programming methods quickly becomes intractable at scale,\nespecially when considering multiple providers and large satellite\nconstellations. To address this issue, we introduce a scalable, hierarchical\nframework that decomposes the global selection problem into single-satellite,\nshort time-window subproblems. Optimal station choices from each subproblem are\nclustered to identify consistently high-value locations across all decomposed\ncases. Cluster-level sets are then matched back to the closest GSaaS candidate\nsites to produce a globally feasible solution. This approach enables scalable\ncoordination while maintaining near-optimal performance. We evaluate our\nmethod's performance on synthetic Walker-Star test cases (1-10 satellites, 1-10\nstations), achieving solutions within 95% of the global IP optimum for all test\ncases.

The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using\n(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the\npurpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder\n(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality\nand/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation\nfrOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from\nself-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers\nthat favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between\nthe synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation\ncorrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is\nremarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new\nreal data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically\nuses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's\nuniversality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching,\nautoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet,\nCIFAR-10, and FFHQ).

Our key\ninnovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary\ncombinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial\nreasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features\n(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,\nMetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that\ncaptures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring\nretrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the\nexisting scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations.

However,\ndelivering accurate highlighting in real time remains challenging for online\nand web-based development tools due to strict time and memory constraints on\nbackend services. These systems must serve highlights rapidly and frequently,\neven when code is partially valid or invalid. This has led to on-the-fly syntax\nhighlighting, where visual annotations are generated just before content is\nserved, often at high request rates and under incomplete input conditions. To\nmeet these demands efficiently, state-of-the-art models use deep learning to\nlearn the behavior of brute-force syntax highlighting resolvers, tools that are\neasy to implement but too slow for production. Through the Deep Abstraction\nprocess, brute-force strategies are encoded into fast statistical models that\nachieve both high accuracy and low-latency inference. Despite their success,\nsuch models face key challenges: they support only one programming language per\nmodel, require large datasets from slow brute-force generators, and involve\nresource-intensive training. In multi-language environments, this means\nmaintaining multiple independent models, increasing system complexity and\noperational cost. This work addresses these issues by introducing a unified\nmodel capable of highlighting up to six mainstream programming languages,\nreducing deployment complexity by a factor of six and improving performance on\nunseen languages.

We\nintroduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level\nmanipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the\nembeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the\ntarget attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder\n(SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our\nmethod operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion\nprocess, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image\nsynthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient\nmanipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains."}

Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves\ndistinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal\ninformation (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple\naligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101\nresearch papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and\nspeaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta\nSimilarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos\nconvey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we\npropose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation\nvideo generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout\nrefinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,\nsubtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing\nslide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate\nthat the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and\ninformative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward\nautomated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and\ncode are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video."}
