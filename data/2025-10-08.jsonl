These\nagents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be\ncompromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a\nmechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined\nsafety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We\nintroduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees\nfor LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and\nverifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive\nvalidation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise\nsafety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and\nsubjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance\nwith these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it\nis deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action\nmonitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each\nproposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This\nseparation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online\nmonitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a\nrobust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents."}

We model a\nsymbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of\ninformation compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove\nthat a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible \"worlds\" (data\nstrings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,\nwe show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a\nspecific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible\nworld relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the \"grounding\nact\" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires\nthe input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from\nthe system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to\nprove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that\ncannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.\nThis establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually\nattempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations."}

In this paper, we introduce the {\\alpha}-convergent graph\n({\\alpha}-CG), a new PG structure that employs a carefully designed edge\npruning rule. This rule eliminates candidate neighbors for each data point p by\napplying the shifted-scaled triangle inequalities among p, its existing\nout-neighbors, and new candidates. If the distance between the query point q\nand its exact nearest neighbor v* is at most {\\tau} for some constant {\\tau} >\n0, our {\\alpha}-CG finds the exact nearest neighbor in poly-logarithmic time,\nassuming bounded intrinsic dimensionality for the dataset; otherwise, it can\nfind an ANN in the same time.

However, the combination of high-dimensional visual inputs and\nagile maneuver outputs leads to long-standing challenges, including low sample\nefficiency and significant sim-to-real gaps. To address these issues, we\npropose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a\nnovel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic\nperformance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the\nlearning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and\na downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer\nmodule is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract\ntemporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual\ninputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract\nvisual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is\ndiscarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged\naccess to global state information supervises the agent during early training\nto provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This\nguidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training\nprogresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments\ndemonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic\npolicy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and\nperceptually complex scenarios."}

TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini\nbackbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid\nnetwork to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational\nefficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark\nperformance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several\nstate-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design\nTF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages\nmodels trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially\norchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region\nlocalization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully\nautomates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research\nin ocular surface diagnostics.

To this end, we propose a\ntwo-stage approach that calibrates and fuses UWB data and SLAM data to achieve\ncoordinate-wise consistent and accurate localization in the same environment.\nIn the first stage, we solve a continuous-time batch optimization problem by\nusing the range and odometry data from one full run, incorporating height\npriors and anchor-to-anchor distance factors to recover the anchors' 3D\npositions. For the subsequent runs in the second stage, a sliding-window\noptimization scheme fuses the UWB and SLAM data, which facilitates accurate\nlocalization in the same coordinate system.

In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which\ninevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to\ndirectly model \"object\" as the visual equivalence of \"word,\" pushing the model\nto learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate\nour hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach\ncan be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random\npatches.

We introduce the Agentic\nReasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular\nreasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is\ndiscovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple\nCoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution\ntraces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which\ncan be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned\nmeta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually\ndesigned MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,\nMASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high\nperformance across different foundation models and task domains without further\noptimization."}

In particular, we\nobserve that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to\neffectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).\nHowever, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step\nreasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its\nsolving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study\nthis issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with\nreasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,\netc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations.

We\nintroduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees\nfor LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and\nverifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive\nvalidation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise\nsafety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and\nsubjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance\nwith these specifications.

We found that when the models had to analyze\nthe student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20\nwith ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement\nlevels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human\nagreement levels.

This fragmentation limits\ntheir evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the\nfull spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete\ndiffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without\nmodality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:\ntranslating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs\nacross domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,\nMeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared\nprobabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we\nemploy a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,\nleveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are\nintroduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,\nand (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.\nExperiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on\nMIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR\n0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance\ndownstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,\nplus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports\ncoherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs."}

Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude\nthese cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study\ninvestigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable\ncode while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling.\nWithin this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents,\nincluding GPT-5 (OpenAI), Claude 3.5 Haiku (Anthropic), and Gemini 2.5 Flash\n(Google), under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were\nevaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students'\noriginal structure and logic. We find that while all three LLMs are capable of\nproducing compilable repairs, their behavior diverges in how well they preserve\nstudents' control flow and code structure, which affects their pedagogical\nutility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and\nmore comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over\ntime."}

To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual\nquestion answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the\nintroduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation\nquality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between\nlighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct\nEgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and\nrefinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked\nby annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs\nacross 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of\nhuman work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the\ndata and code will be made available upon acceptance."}
