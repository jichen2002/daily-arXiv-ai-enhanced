This creates a need for a tool to support\ncybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats\nduring the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of\nleveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented\ngeneration to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain\nwhile complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit\nexternal data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts\nin interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project.\nThe results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by\ngenerating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing\nredundancy checks.

Static partitioning of\nthe data structure for distribution is not desirable, as it is prone to uneven\nload distribution over time, and having to change the partitioning scheme later\nwill require downtime.\n  Since a distributed data structure, inherently, relies on communication\nsupport from the network stack and operating systems, we introduce the notion\nof conditional lock-freedom that extends the notion of lock-free computation\nwith reasonable assumptions about communication between processes. We present\nDiLi, a conditional lock-free, linearizable, and distributable linked list that\ncan be asynchronously and dynamically (1) partitioned into multiple sublists\nand (2) load balanced by distributing sublists across multiple machines.

Solving\nthese tasks requires a sort of \\emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected\nin words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and\npiecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge\nthe current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training\nwheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single\ntarget structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file\nimplementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for\nresearchers."}

If the user\nbehavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are\nviewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection\nbased on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl\nalgorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial\nbehavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is\nquantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed\nfor transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense\nvectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation\nlearning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the\nframe imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on\ntemporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined\nto identify the spammers.

We tackle this selection\nproblem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop\nmethods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and\nperformance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational\ndomains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively\nrepresent human populations compared to baselines.

However, existing\nbenchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,\nforcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance\nto memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function\nfitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering\nembedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising\n324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design\nmitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic\nalterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are\nscalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we\nelevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model\ndiscovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems\nto uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but\nfragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades\nprecipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme\nsensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of\ntool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by\ninducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to\nsatisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,\ngeneralizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core\nchallenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic\ntestbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and\nguiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine\nscientific discovery."}

If a\nCT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the\nmodel may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design\nfeatures which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate\nartifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images\nfrom this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,\nthis study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that\nmaintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without\ncorresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in\nsinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against\nbaseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT\ndataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean\nimages fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional\naugmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen\nartifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high\nclassification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact\ndata during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for\nartifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification\nperformance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained\nwith labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to\nuniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation\ncan effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring\nexpensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for\ndeployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge."}

Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label.

One key challenge in\nlong video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear\nin different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior\nworks have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer\nfrom limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits\ntheir overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we\nbuild upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the\ninherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the\nID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new\nbenchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using\nthis benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights\nthat the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)\nenhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of\ninformation of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a\nnovel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning\nEffectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption\nquality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision\nof ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%\nto 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track\ndifferent individuals in the captions of long videos."}

To bridge this gap, we\npresent U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that\nevaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates\nmodels along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot\ngeneralization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,\nU-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering\na deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis\nand Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale\nevaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and\narchitectural paradigms on model performance.
