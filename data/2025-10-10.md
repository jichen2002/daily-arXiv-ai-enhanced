*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化的查询选择和合成与真实训练样本的智能权重，有效提升了小目标和低对比度船只的检测能力。系统在保持实时性能的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度和精度之间的平衡。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicEval是一个新的T2V评估基准，专注于动态相机运动，通过新设计的背景和前景一致性度量方法，显著提升了评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准如VBench和EvalCrafter存在两个主要局限：缺乏动态相机运动的评估和视频级别评分的忽视。DynamicEval旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 通过系统化设计的动态相机运动提示和45k人工标注视频对，评估视频质量的背景场景一致性和前景对象一致性。提出新的背景一致性度量方法和前景一致性度量方法。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的度量方法在视频级别和模型级别上均与人类偏好有更强的相关性（提升超过2%），确立了DynamicEval在动态相机运动下评估T2V模型的全面性。

Conclusion: DynamicEval作为一个新的评估基准，通过引入动态相机运动的系统化提示和大量人工标注，显著提升了文本到视频（T2V）模型在动态运动下的评估能力。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP结合重启惯性和分数先验，在成像逆问题中实现快速收敛和高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如RED）通常专注于设计复杂的图像先验以提高重建质量，而忽略了收敛加速的需求。RISP旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP)方法，结合了重启惯性以加速收敛和基于分数的图像先验以保证重建质量。

Result: RISP在不要求图像先验凸性的情况下，实现了比RED更快的固定点收敛速度，并通过实验验证了其快速收敛和高重建质量的特点。

Conclusion: RISP通过结合重启惯性和基于分数的图像先验，在保证高质量重建的同时实现了快速收敛，实验证明了其在多种成像逆问题中的优越性。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像纯化策略和频率域流匹配模型的超低剂量CT去噪方法，有效解决了数据不匹配问题，并在解剖结构保持上取得了最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT(uLDCT)虽然显著降低了辐射暴露，但引入了严重的噪声和伪影，并与正常剂量CT(NDCT)图像对存在空间不对齐问题，现有去噪网络难以直接应用。

Method: 提出了一种基于图像纯化(IP)策略的创新去噪框架，包括构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集、生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对，以及频率域流匹配(FFM)模型的应用。

Result: 实验证明，IP策略显著提升了多种主流去噪模型在uLDCT任务上的性能，FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到了SOTA效果。

Conclusion: 本研究为真实世界超低剂量CT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案，并通过IP策略和FFM模型的结合实现了在解剖结构保持方面的SOTA效果。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA是一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法，能有效削弱或去除水印，揭示当前水印设计的弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的广泛使用加剧了对内容归属和来源验证的水印方法的需求，但现有方案在对抗环境下仍显脆弱。

Method: 通过将水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，D2RA在不访问底层模型的情况下抑制水印信号，同时保持视觉保真度。

Result: 实验表明，D2RA能持续降低多种水印方案的可检测性。

Conclusion: D2RA攻击方法揭示了当前水印设计的根本弱点，即使在资源受限的对抗环境下也能有效削弱或去除水印。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一种视频风格迁移框架，通过低秩适配器和合成训练剪辑解决数据不足问题，结合CS-CFG实现高质量迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格迁移任务中缺乏配对视频数据监督的挑战。

Method: 提出了PickStyle框架，结合低秩适配器和合成训练剪辑，利用CS-CFG分解风格与内容方向。

Result: 实验证明PickStyle在多个基准测试中表现优异，实现了高质量的视频风格迁移。

Conclusion: PickStyle框架在视频风格迁移任务中表现出色，实现了时间一致性、风格忠实性和内容保留性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探索了视频语言模型（VLMs）作为物理合理性评估工具的潜力，提出了TRAVL微调方法和ImplausiBench基准，以改进和评估模型的物理推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反直观物理定律的序列，但目前缺乏评估视频物理合理性的稳健方法。

Method: 引入TRAVL，一种结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块的微调方法，以改进VLMs中的运动编码和判别能力。

Result: TRAVL和ImplausiBench共同提高了对多模态模型中物理合理性的评估能力，并通过严格的LLM-as-judge指标和人类判断进行验证。

Conclusion: TRAVL和ImplausiBench为多模态模型中的物理合理性提供了一个统一的评估和改进框架，揭示了视觉-时间理解中一个具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S3FN通过结合文本语义与光谱空间数据，提升HSI分类性能，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量训练样本有限且光谱数据维度高，HSI分类模型易过拟合且难以平衡精度与计算复杂度。现有模型多为单模态，仅依赖光谱空间数据。

Method: S3FN利用LLMs生成类别特定的文本描述，并通过预训练文本编码器（如BERT或RoBERTa）将其嵌入向量空间，以提取有意义的标签语义，从而改善特征-标签对齐。

Result: 在三个HSI基准数据集（Hyperspectral Wood、HyperspectralBlueberries、DeepHS-Fruit）上评估，模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的S3FN模型通过结合文本语义与光谱空间数据，显著提升了HSI分类性能，为语义增强的HSI分类模型开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAGUL是一种基于交叉模态注意力的视觉语言模型遗忘框架，有效防止敏感信息泄露且不改变预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露私密或敏感信息的问题，尤其是在视觉问答任务中，视觉上下文可能包含敏感信息。

Method: 利用交叉模态注意力探索视觉标记在输出生成中的作用，并基于此提出了CAGUL框架，通过外部模块编码低重要性视觉标记的遗忘信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，CAGUL在性能上优于或与基于微调的基线方法相当，同时避免了修改预训练模型参数和重新训练的成本。

Conclusion: CAGUL是一种轻量级且高效的视觉语言模型遗忘框架，通过交叉模态注意力引导的遗忘方法，不仅防止了敏感信息泄露，还保留了参考模型行为，且无需修改预训练模型参数或承担重新训练成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaSC is an automated maize stand counting algorithm using YOLOv9 on UAV-captured imagery, showing high accuracy and real-time potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual counting of maize stands is labor-intensive, slow, and error-prone, especially in large or variable fields. Automated solutions are needed for accurate crop management and research.

Method: MaSC uses a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10 growth stages, operating in two modes: mosaic images divided into patches and raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. It distinguishes maize from weeds and performs row and range segmentation.

Result: Evaluation showed strong agreement with ground truth (R^2=0.616 for mosaics, R^2=0.906 for raw frames). MaSC processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 seconds, demonstrating potential for real-time operation.

Conclusion: MaSC is a scalable, low-cost, and accurate tool for automated maize stand counting, suitable for both research and production environments.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QCN 是 CapsNet 的快速版本，通过减少胶囊数量提升速度，适用于实时应用，准确性略有下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet 在 MNIST 数据集上表现出色，但训练和测试速度较慢，限制了其在实时应用中的使用。QCN 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: QCN 通过减少胶囊数量来加速网络，并采用更强大的解码器进一步优化性能。

Result: QCN 在 MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN 和 Cifar-10 数据集上实现了5倍的推理速度提升。

Conclusion: Quick-CapsNet (QCN) 是一种快速的 CapsNet 替代方案，虽然在准确性上有轻微损失，但在推理速度上提升了5倍，适用于需要快速网络的实时应用。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++是一种改进的引导方法，解决了标准CFG在rectified flow模型中的问题，并在多个基准测试中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFG在基于rectified flow的模型中会导致视觉伪影、文本不对齐和脆弱行为，需要一种更稳定的引导方法。

Method: 提出了一种自适应预测器-校正器引导方法，结合条件RF更新和加权条件校正，确保速度场的边际一致性和轨迹在数据流形附近。

Result: 在多个大规模文本到图像模型（Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina）上，Rectified-CFG++在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic和T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上表现优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++通过结合确定性效率与几何感知条件规则，有效解决了标准CFG在基于rectified flow的模型中引发的离流形漂移问题，并在多个基准数据集上表现优于标准CFG。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

Conclusion: PIT-QMM 是一种新型的大型多模态模型（LMM），在无参考点云质量评估（NR-PCQA）任务中表现优异，显著超越了现有技术，并在模型可解释性和交互性方面开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

Motivation: 现有的个性化扩散模型在生成图像时往往过于依赖主题图像而忽略文本提示，导致控制不足。

Method: 提出在第二次处理中使用IP-Adapter自动生成的掩码来限制图像令牌，使其仅关注主题而非背景，从而允许文本提示更好地控制图像的其余部分。

Result: 该方法生成的图像能准确描绘主题并匹配文本提示，相比其他测试时个性化方法表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用自动生成的掩码在第二次处理中限制图像令牌，从而更准确地结合文本提示生成图像，显示出高度的提示和源图像对齐。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像注册中表现出优越性能，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位。此外，现有模型大多无法自适应地确定不同图像变形需求的迭代次数，导致注册准确性下降。

Method: 提出了特征增强残差模块（FERM）作为金字塔网络各解码层的核心组件，FERM包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、学习抑制无关特征以及估计最终变形场。此外，提出了双阶段阈值控制迭代（TCI）策略，第一阶段评估注册稳定性，第二阶段在稳定后评估收敛性。

Result: TCIP在多个数据集上优于现有最先进的注册网络，同时保持了可比的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数大小。FERM和TCI的通用性通过与其他注册网络的集成得到了验证。

Conclusion: TCIP模型通过整合FERM和TCI策略，在三个公共脑MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上表现出优于现有最先进注册网络的准确性，同时保持了可比的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数大小。此外，FERM和TCI的通用性通过与其他注册网络的集成得到了验证。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过变分推断和逐步KL散度最小化，结合上下文条件分解技术，显著提升了视频生成的可控性、多样性和3D一致性。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust

Method: 提出了一种新颖的弱到强框架MLH，包含一个强中心哈希分支和一个弱成对哈希分支，通过迭代式相互学习过程，中心分支利用成对分支学到的局部相似性线索。此外，引入了混合哈希专家模块，促进跨分支交互。

Result: MLH在多个基准数据集上一致优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH通过结合中心哈希和成对哈希的优势，显著提升了图像检索的性能，并在多个基准数据集上超越了现有最先进的方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Repainter通过结合强化学习和空间轨迹细化，显著提升了电商图像修复的质量，特别是在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SyncHuman通过结合2D多视图生成模型和3D原生生成模型，实现了从单视图图像中高质量重建 clothed human mesh，即使在挑战性姿势下也能保持几何准确性和视觉保真度。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Conclusion: ComGS框架通过引入Surface Octahedral Probes（SOPs）和简化光照估计任务，实现了高质量的实时3D对象-场景合成，渲染速度约为28 FPS，编辑时间仅需36秒。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 超高动态范围场景中，标准曝光设置下亮暗区域细节难以同时保留。RGB包围曝光方法易受错位和重影影响，而短曝光RAW图像因其高比特深度和可预测噪声特性更具潜力。研究目标是仅用单帧短曝光RAW图像实现UHDR重建。

Method: 引入UltraLED两阶段框架：首先通过比率图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围，随后使用亮度感知RAW去噪器增强暗区细节恢复。设计了9档包围曝光流程合成真实UHDR图像，并构建对应数据集。

Result: 实验表明，UltraLED在单帧方法中表现显著优于现有技术，且避免了动态场景中的重影和运动模糊问题。

Conclusion: UltraLED通过两阶段框架（曝光校正和亮度感知RAW去噪）显著提升了单帧短曝光RAW图像在超高动态范围场景中的重建性能，并公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Motivation: 低帧率RGB视频中大的帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性，而事件相机虽然能捕捉快速视觉变化但缺乏颜色信息。结合两者可以解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用事件运动先验指导变形场优化，包括LoCM无监督微调框架提取事件流中的运动先验，以及几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实场景中均优于现有基于图像和事件的方法，证明了事件数据对动态3DGS优化的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架通过结合事件运动先验和几何感知数据关联方法，成功优化了动态3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的重建，显著提升了在低帧率RGB视频中的性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注自我中心视角或地理图形视角，缺乏对地理时空智能的综合评估，这对交通管理和应急响应等领域至关重要。

Method: 提出了Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark（GTR-Bench），用于评估移动目标在大规模摄像头网络中的地理时空推理能力。

Result: 评估显示，即使最佳专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro（34.9%）也显著落后于人类表现（78.61%），并揭示了模型在时空推理上的三大缺陷。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench揭示了当前视觉语言模型在地理时空推理上的三大主要缺陷，为时空智能的研究和应用提供了新的机遇。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的光流表示方法MM-COF和网络架构FMANet，通过整合微表情两个阶段的运动信息并自适应地融合运动线索，显著提升了微表情识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情由于其微妙和短暂的性质，是真实情绪的重要指标。尽管微表情在心理学、安全和行为分析中具有重要意义，但由于难以捕捉微妙的面部运动，微表情识别仍然具有挑战性。现有方法大多只计算起始帧和顶点帧之间的光流，从而忽略了顶点到偏移阶段的基本运动信息。

Method: 本文首先引入了一种全面的运动表示方法MM-COF，该方法将微表情两个阶段的运动动态整合为一个统一的描述符。然后提出了FMANet，一种新型的端到端神经网络架构，该架构将双阶段分析和幅度调制内部化为可学习模块。

Result: 在MMEW、SMIC、CASME-II和SAMM等标准基准数据集上的实验评估表明，所提出的MM-COF表示和FMANet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MM-COF表示方法和FMANet网络架构在微表情识别任务中优于现有方法，展示了可学习的双阶段框架在推动微表情识别领域的潜力。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Motivation: 传统的视觉提示方法在表达能力和过拟合方面存在局限性，限制了其准确率。

Method: 提出了 ACAVP（仿射、颜色和加法视觉提示），结合仿射变换和颜色变换来增强视觉提示的表达能力，并引入 TrivialAugment 作为有效的数据增强方法。

Result: ACAVP 在十二个不同的图像分类数据集上实现了最先进的准确率，超越了线性探测的平均准确率，并表现出对分布偏移的更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACAVP 通过引入互补的变换操作（仿射和颜色变换）增强了视觉提示的表达能力，并在保持最小计算开销的同时，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的准确率。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Conclusion: MMHOI-Net在多人多物体交互建模中表现出色，在准确性和重建质量上均达到先进水平。

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在大规模城市环境中因多尺度几何不匹配导致的严重伪影和优化不稳定问题。

Method: PrismGS集成了金字塔多尺度监督和显式尺寸正则化，前者通过预过滤图像金字塔强制一致性，后者通过物理基础的下界限制高斯尺寸。

Result: 在MatrixCity、Mill-19和UrbanScene3D数据集上，PrismGS实现了约1.5 dB的PSNR提升，优于CityGaussian。

Conclusion: PrismGS通过物理基础的正则化框架显著提升了3D高斯模型的渲染质量，特别是在大尺度城市环境中，有效减少了伪影和优化不稳定性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

Conclusion: 利用语义先验作为几何正则化器可以从有限的输入视图中产生更连贯和完整的3D模型。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test

provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet

chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a

works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware

embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach

Conclusion: XYZCylinder通过统一的圆柱提升方法和专用模块，显著提升了驾驶场景的重建精度和泛化能力，并在不同评估设置下达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

Method: 该方法采用基于回报差异的对比学习，通过构建正负样本对和对比三重态，训练注意力机制区分与不同结果相关的状态特征。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准测试的一系列操作任务中，该方法实现了最高2.4倍的样本效率提升，并能解决基线方法无法学习的任务。

Conclusion: Gaze on the Prize框架通过引入可学习的焦点注意力机制，显著提高了视觉强化学习在样本效率和任务解决能力上的表现，无需修改底层算法或超参数。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy

degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于语义场景图的点云深度压缩框架，实现高效数据传输，支持下游应用，实验显示压缩率高达98%。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在带宽受限和连接不稳定的情况下，点云数据的大规模和复杂性会降低系统性能，因此需要高效的传输方法。

Method: 该方法将点云分解为语义一致的补丁，并使用基于特征线性调制（FiLM）的语义感知编码器将其编码为紧凑的潜在表示。通过由潜在特征和图节点属性引导的折叠式解码器实现结构精确的重建。

Conclusion: 提出的基于语义场景图的深度压缩框架在保持结构和语义保真度的同时，实现了高达98%的数据压缩率，并支持下游应用如多机器人位姿图优化和地图合并。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Motivation: 异常检测在制造业质量控制中至关重要，但受限于异常样本稀少和人工标注成本高。异常合成虽有潜力，但现有研究缺乏系统评估，且忽视了合成算法的关键因素。

Method: 提出了ASBench框架，引入四个关键评估维度：跨数据集和管道的泛化性能、合成与真实数据的比例、合成图像内在指标与异常检测性能指标的相关性，以及混合异常合成方法的策略。

Result: 通过大量实验，ASBench不仅揭示了当前异常合成方法的局限性，还为未来研究提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: ASBench是一个全面的基准测试框架，旨在系统评估异常合成方法，揭示了现有方法的局限性，并为未来研究提供了可行的方向。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

TL;DR: Memoir通过想象引导的检索机制结合环境观察和行为模式，显著提升了记忆持久性VLN的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆持久性VLN方法缺乏有效的记忆访问机制，且忽视了对导航行为模式的存储，导致决策策略受限。

Method: 1) 使用语言条件化的世界模型想象未来状态以编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视点级记忆锚定观察和行为模式；3) 通过专用编码器整合检索知识。

Result: 在多样化的记忆持久性VLN基准测试中，Memoir表现出显著改进，IR2R上SPL提升5.4%，训练速度提升8.3倍，推理内存减少74%。

Conclusion: Memoir通过结合环境观察和行为模式的选择性检索，显著提升了记忆持久性视觉与语言导航（VLN）的性能，并展示了该范式的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在组合场景（如运动、数量和空间关系）中表现不佳，需要一种无需训练即可改善文本Z-图像对齐的方法。

Method: 引入TTOM框架，通过优化新参数和布局-注意力目标，结合参数化记忆机制，支持流式视频生成中的历史优化上下文管理。

Result: 在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中，TTOM表现出高效、实用、可扩展的特性，显著提升了组合视频生成的质量。

Conclusion: TTOM框架通过测试时优化和记忆机制，显著提升了视频基础模型在组合场景下的表现，实现了跨模态对齐，展现出强大的可迁移性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

TL;DR: ResAD通过残差轨迹建模和点归一化，解决了E2EAD中的时空不平衡问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E2EAD系统因轨迹数据的时空不平衡导致模型学习虚假关联，且优先考虑不确定的远距离预测，影响即时安全性。

Method: 提出ResAD框架，通过预测残差偏差而非直接轨迹，并结合点归一化技术优化学习目标。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD以仅两次去噪步骤实现了88.6的PDMS，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: ResAD通过归一化残差轨迹建模框架有效解决了E2EAD系统中轨迹数据的时空不平衡问题，显著提升了模型性能和学习效率。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Motivation: 随着自动驾驶的发展，对高保真视频生成和多样化信息（如深度估计）的需求增加。

Method: 提出CVD-STORM，一种利用空间-时间重建变分自编码器（VAE）的跨视角视频扩散模型，通过微调VAE并整合到视频扩散过程中来提升生成质量。

Conclusion: CVD-STORM模型通过结合4D重建任务和视频扩散过程，显著提升了生成视频的质量，并在动态场景重建中提供了有价值的几何信息。

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Motivation: 现有文本检测数据集主要针对自然或文档场景，而动漫场景中的文本风格多样、排列不规则且易与复杂视觉元素混淆，因此需要专门的数据集。

Method: 引入了一个大规模数据集AnimeText，包含73.5万张图像和420万个标注文本块，具有分层注释和针对动漫场景的硬负样本。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用AnimeText训练的模型在动漫场景文本检测任务中优于基于现有数据集训练的模型。

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

Conclusion: SimCast和CasCast框架通过结合确定性预测和概率模型，显著提高了降水临近预报的准确性，特别是在强降雨区域的预测上表现优异。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

Motivation: 解决 UHD 图像恢复中计算效率与高频率细节保留之间的权衡问题，传统 VAE 的高斯约束会丢失退化相关的高频率信息。

Method: 提出了 Latent Harmony 框架，包括 LH-VAE（增强语义鲁棒性和高频率重建）和 HF-LoRA（通过高频率对齐损失和感知导向损失优化编码器和解码器）。

Result: 实验表明 Latent Harmony 在 UHD 和标准分辨率任务中均达到最先进性能，平衡了效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony 在 UHD 图像恢复任务中实现了效率和重建质量的平衡，通过两阶段框架和 HF-LoRA 技术，显著提升了高频率细节的保留和重建精度。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

Motivation: 对象标签和抽象标签在计算机视觉任务中各有优势，但哪种更适合图像隐私这一主观且依赖上下文的任务尚不明确。

Method: 通过比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类任务中的表现，探索哪种标签更适合这一主观且依赖上下文的任务。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签更有效；当标签数量较多时，对象标签同样有用。

Conclusion: 研究发现，在标签预算有限时，抽象标签对图像隐私分类更有效；而当每个图像的标签数量较多时，对象标签同样有用。这些发现将为未来开发更准确的图像隐私分类器提供指导。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

Method: 比较了基于Transformer的SwinIR模型和轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的性能和效率。

Result: SwinIR模型的PSNR为39.03 dB，而轻量级CNN的PSNR为37.4 dB，但CNN仅需10个训练周期且模型大小是SwinIR的1/55。

Conclusion: 标准CNN在计算资源有限的实际应用中提供了一个接近最先进性能的解决方案，展示了其在资源受限情况下的优势。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Conclusion: RayFusion 通过利用协作者的射线占用信息，显著提升了基于纯摄像头的协作视觉感知系统的检测性能，并在实验中表现优于现有最先进模型。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RASALoRE是一种新型两阶段弱监督异常检测框架，通过DDPT和区域感知空间注意力机制，在脑部MRI扫描中实现高性能检测，参数少且计算高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑部MRI扫描中缺乏精确像素级标注时，仅凭弱标签（如切片级）实现快速准确异常检测的挑战。

Method: 提出了RASALoRE，一个两阶段WSAD框架：第一阶段使用判别性双提示调优（DDPT）生成高质量伪弱掩码；第二阶段通过区域感知空间注意力机制和固定位置随机嵌入的分割网络聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在BraTS20、BraTS21、BraTS23和MSD数据集上表现出显著性能提升，计算复杂度大幅降低。

Conclusion: RASALoRE 在脑部MRI扫描的弱监督异常检测（WSAD）中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，同时参数量少于800万，计算复杂度大幅降低。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

TL;DR: RetouchLLM是一种无需训练、基于代码的图像润色系统，通过视觉评论家和代码生成器实现可解释、可控的调整，适应多样化需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要大规模配对数据且操作不透明，限制了其适应多样化、用户或图像特定调整的能力。

Method: RetouchLLM采用训练自由的白色盒子方法，通过视觉评论家识别输入与参考图像的差异，代码生成器生成可执行代码，逐步增强图像。

Result: 实验表明，RetouchLLM能很好地泛化到多样化润色风格，通过自然语言用户交互实现可解释和可控的调整。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提出了一种无需训练、基于代码的图像润色系统，通过视觉评论家和代码生成器模块实现可解释、可控的调整，能够适应多样化的用户需求和风格。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种层次残差神经网络，通过多分支和层次惩罚提升多光谱图像时间序列的分类能力，实验证明其在小样本和新区域分类中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多光谱图像时间序列在不同语义层次上的分类问题，特别是在训练样本有限的情况下，如何提升分类的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 通过修改ResNet架构，增加分支以在不同层次进行分类，并利用层次惩罚图避免不连贯的层次转换。采用类层次标签高效训练不同层，前层快速训练宏观类，后层专注于微观类的区分。

Result: 在2019年12个月的Sentinel 2图像上实验，结果表明该方法在宏观和微观类层次上均能有效泛化，并在新目标区域的微观类分类中表现出色，尤其是对少数类别的表征更优。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多时间类驱动层次残差神经网络（ResNet）通过引入层次惩罚图和模块化架构，有效提升了多光谱图像时间序列在不同语义层次上的分类能力，并在实验中证明了其在小样本训练和新目标区域分类中的优越性。

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测评估和基准测试缺乏特异性、多样性及技术限制，无法满足现实需求。

Method: 利用9个商业在线平台整合最新的深度伪造技术，生成超过60,000张伪造图像和1,000段 manipulated 视频，模拟真实世界场景。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有深度伪造检测方案在现实应用中的实用性有限，RedFace数据集能更全面地评估检测性能。

Conclusion: RedFace数据集通过模拟真实世界的黑盒场景，有效填补了学术评估与实际需求之间的差距，并验证了现有深度伪造检测方案在现实应用中的局限性。

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

Motivation: AI生成的视频已实现近乎完美的视觉真实感，亟需可靠的检测机制来应对高维时空动态建模和识别违反物理定律的细微异常的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于概率流守恒原则的物理驱动AI生成视频检测范式，包括NSG统计量的计算和NSG-VD检测方法。

Result: 实验证实NSG-VD在召回率和F1分数上分别优于现有基线方法16.00%和10.75%。

Conclusion: NSG-VD方法在检测AI生成视频方面表现出色，显著优于现有基线方法，验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

Conclusion: DarkHash 是一种无需训练数据即可植入后门的新型攻击方法，通过双语义引导和拓扑对齐损失优化，显著提升了攻击效果，并在实验中证明了其优越性和防御能力。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

Motivation: 解决极端视角下人脸解析因标注数据有限而面临的挑战，避免高成本的手动标注。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的标签细化流程，通过联合拟合两个3D高斯泼溅模型（一个用于RGB图像，一个用于初始分割图），利用共享几何实现多视图一致性，从而合成姿态多样的训练数据。

Result: 在极端头部姿态下的人脸解析准确性显著提升，同时保持标准视图下的强性能，实验证明优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合3D高斯泼溅技术和多视图一致性，提供了一种无需地面真实3D标注即可生成高质量分割掩码的解决方案，显著提升了极端视角下人脸解析的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

Motivation: 在有限数据领域（如放射学）中实现深度学习模型的泛化能力需要图像增强技术。然而，将自然图像的增强方法直接应用于CT扫描可能忽视CT模态的特性（HU强度的物理意义），导致伪影和泛化能力差。

Method: 提出了一种名为随机窗位调整的CT特定数据增强技术，该方法考虑了CT图像中HU强度的物理意义，避免了传统自然图像增强方法可能引入的伪影和泛化能力差的问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种CT特定的数据增强技术——随机窗位调整，该方法通过利用CT图像中的HU强度分布，显著提高了模型在对比度不佳或时间不准确的挑战性图像上的性能，并在肝脏肿瘤分割任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Motivation: 现有AR视频扩散模型在实时运动控制视频生成中存在延迟和质量退化问题，缺乏有效的自回归方法。

Method: 首先微调基础I2V模型以支持基本运动控制，然后通过轨迹奖励模型进行强化学习优化。设计保留了马尔可夫性质的自展机制，并在去噪步骤中选择性引入随机性以加速训练。

Result: 实验表明，AR-Drag在视觉保真度和运动对齐方面表现优异，显著降低了延迟，且仅需1.3B参数。

Conclusion: AR-Drag通过强化学习和自展机制，显著提升了实时图像到视频生成的视觉保真度和运动对齐精度，同时减少了延迟，仅使用1.3B参数。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）常生成自相矛盾的输出，严重影响其可靠性并阻碍实际应用。在视频语言模型（Video-LLMs）中，这一现象引起了研究者的关注，但其根本原因尚未充分探索。

Method: 本文采用可解释性驱动的方法，分析、统计总结并干预了导致Video-LLMs输出不一致的潜在因素，并提出了一种称为Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening（TCAS）的注意力增强方法。该方法基于注意力差异构建增强目标，以提高模型的时间分辨率能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的TCAS方法显著提升了Video-LLMs的时间逻辑一致性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。此外，该方法在一般视频时间定位任务中也表现出性能提升，表明时间逻辑一致性是时间理解的瓶颈。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Conclusion: UniMMVSR通过整合多模态条件（如文本、图像和视频）显著提升了视频超分辨率的质量，并成功实现了4K视频的多模态引导生成，这在现有技术中是不可行的。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态推理链显著提升了图像编辑的精度和保真度，特别是在处理复杂对象交互和细粒度空间关系时表现优异。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类任务需要处理几何偏差和噪声，现有方法依赖于大量数据增强或等变架构，前者需要强大模型，后者限制了表达性并增加成本。规范化方法通过屏蔽偏差提供了一种替代方案，但实际中由于训练数据未对齐，规范化器变得脆弱。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种自举算法，通过逐步减少方差和恢复对齐假设来迭代重新对齐训练样本。该方法在四个FGVC基准测试中表现优于等变和规范化基线，与数据增强方法效果相当。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag 是一个结合文本指令和对象拖拽的扩散框架，解决了现有方法的定位和灵活性限制，实现了高保真图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动和对象拖拽方法各有局限：文本方法难以精确定位对象，拖拽方法仅支持静态重定位。InstructUDrag 旨在结合两者优势，实现更灵活的编辑。

Method: InstructUDrag 将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为移动重建分支和文本驱动编辑分支，利用能量梯度指导和交叉注意力优化，并结合 DDPM 反演和噪声图先验信息注入。

Result: 实验表明，InstructUDrag 能够实现灵活、高保真的图像编辑，同时确保对象重定位的精确性和对图像内容的语义控制。

Conclusion: InstructUDrag 通过结合文本指令和对象拖拽，实现了高保真度的图像编辑，同时提供了精确的对象重定位和语义控制。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

TL;DR: FineDual通过三阶段方法动态建模层次化的人体交互，显著提升双人运动生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在双人运动生成中忽视了距离和层次化的动态交互特性，导致生成效果不佳。

Method: FineDual采用三阶段方法：1. 自学习阶段通过大型语言模型将双人整体文本分解为个体文本；2. 自适应调整阶段通过交互距离预测器和交互感知图网络动态建模交互；3. 教师引导细化阶段利用整体文本特征细化运动特征。

Result: 在双人运动数据集上的定量和定性评估表明，FineDual优于现有方法，能有效建模动态层次化的人体交互。

Conclusion: FineDual方法通过三阶段建模动态层次化的人体交互，显著提升了双人运动生成的质量和精细度，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaGC是一种针对遥感图像单正多标签学习的新型框架，通过自适应梯度校准和混合训练策略，有效解决了监督模糊性问题，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像的多标签分类（MLC）比单标签分类（SLC）能提供更全面的语义理解，但完整的标注成本高且复杂。单正多标签学习（SPML）作为一种实用替代方案，因仅需单标签标注而具有可扩展性，但也带来了监督模糊性问题。目前，SPML在遥感领域的研究较少，因此需要专门的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为AdaGC的新型框架，结合了梯度校准机制、Mixup技术和双EMA模块，用于生成鲁棒的伪标签。通过一个理论基础的指标自适应触发梯度校准，以避免对标签噪声的过拟合。

Result: 在两个基准遥感数据集上的实验表明，AdaGC在两种不同的标签噪声类型下均达到了最先进的性能，并展现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGC在遥感图像的多标签分类中表现出色，通过自适应梯度校准和混合训练策略，有效地解决了单正多标签学习中的监督模糊性问题，并在多种噪声环境下保持了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

TL;DR: NTN-Diff通过频率感知和分阶段去噪，解决了文本引导图像修复中的语义一致性和未掩码区域保护问题，实验表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能同时解决文本引导图像修复中未掩码区域保护和语义一致性的挑战，这源于混合频率带在去噪过程中对文本提示的不同鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种名为NTN-Diff的null-text-null频率感知扩散模型，通过将语义一致性分解为各频率带的一致性，并在去噪过程中分阶段处理中低频带，实现了未掩码区域的保护与语义一致性。

Result: NTN-Diff在实验中表现优于现有扩散模型，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频率感知分解和分阶段去噪过程，成功解决了文本引导图像修复中的语义一致性和未掩码区域保护的挑战，实验验证了其优于现有扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经场景表示在处理包含强曝光变化的真实世界数据时输出质量下降的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的神经表示用于曝光预测，并通过神经调节机制联合优化场景表示和曝光场。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，提升了55%以上，且训练速度更快。

Conclusion: Neural Exposure Fields (NExF) 通过学习预测每个3D点的最佳曝光值，显著提升了在动态范围场景中的3D重建和视图合成质量，无需后处理或多曝光捕捉。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在视频长度增加时计算复杂度高且难以平衡局部与全局性的问题。

Method: 通过堆叠稀疏局部注意力（扩张窗口注意力）和随机选择全局键来平衡局部与全局性，并设计全局查询以直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个基准测试中达到最优性能，MeViS valu和val数据集分别提升11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的LTCA机制在四个基准测试中达到了新的最优性能，显著提升了MeViS数据集的性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在3D数据稀疏性、噪声和几何模糊性方面的不足，以及功能边界语义一致性的缺失。

Conclusion: 论文提出的跨模态学习范式（CMAT）和分割Transformer（CAST）显著提升了3D功能分割的精度，并在标准基准测试中取得了新的最优结果。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次增长，线性注意力虽能降低成本，但完全替代二次注意力需要昂贵的预训练。LinVideo 旨在通过数据后训练框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了选择性转移方法，将层选择视为二分类问题，并引入 ADM 目标以高效对齐采样轨迹中的样本分布。

Result: 实验表明，LinVideo 实现了 1.25-2.00 倍的速度提升，且 4 步蒸馏模型进一步降低了 15.92 倍的延迟，视觉质量损失极小。

Conclusion: LinVideo 是一种高效的无数据后训练框架，通过选择性转移和 ADM 目标，成功将目标数量的自注意力模块替换为线性注意力，同时保持原始模型的性能，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要可靠的感知能力，尤其是在远距离和近距离场景中。当前的小型视觉语言模型在交通场景中的表现尚未达到人类水平，因此需要专门的基准测试来评估和改进。

Method: 研究通过引入DTPQA基准测试，专注于交通场景中的感知问题，并排除了需要推理的问题，以评估小型视觉语言模型的感知能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 论文提出VideoVerse基准，用于评估T2V模型在时间因果性和世界知识理解方面的能力，填补现有评估不足，并揭示当前模型与世界模型的差距。


<details>

Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准在评估维度、事件级时间因果性和世界知识系统性评估方面存在不足，无法有效区分最先进的T2V模型。

Method: 收集跨领域代表性视频，提取事件级描述并重写为文本到视频提示，设计包含十个维度的二进制评估问题，构建包含300个提示的基准，并开发基于现代视觉语言模型的人类偏好对齐QA评估流程。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入VideoVerse基准，系统地评估了当前T2V模型在时间因果性和世界知识理解方面的能力，揭示了现有模型与世界模型之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

TL;DR: 本文首次将连续时间一致性蒸馏扩展到应用级图像和视频扩散模型，提出了rCM方法，显著提升了生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管sCM在学术规模的扩散加速中表现优异，但在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的应用仍存在基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 提出了score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM)，通过结合score distillation作为长跳跃正则化器，改善了sCM在细节生成上的质量限制。

Result: rCM在14B参数和5秒视频的大规模模型上验证，其质量指标与最先进的DMD2方法相当或更优，同时在多样性上具有显著优势。

Conclusion: rCM作为一种实用且理论基础的框架，显著提升了大规模扩散蒸馏的效果，在仅需1~4步的情况下生成高保真样本，加速了扩散采样的15~50倍。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过模块化框架简化空间图像处理，同时保持结构细节，提升图像分析和计算机视觉的效率和准确性。

Method: 该研究提出了一种模块化框架，包括灰度量化、颜色和亮度增强、图像锐化、双向变换管道以及几何特征提取。具体方法包括八级灰度量化、RGB和YCrCb色彩空间的直方图均衡化、HSV值通道亮度调整、3x3卷积核锐化、双向变换管道（包括非锐化掩模、伽马校正和噪声放大），以及Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测等几何特征提取技术。

Result: 双向变换管道的准确率分别为76.10%（正向）和74.80%（反向），几何特征提取中球杆隔离的相似度达到81.87%。

Conclusion: 实验评估表明，该模块化框架在多样数据集上表现出稳健且确定性的性能，展示了其在实时图像分析和计算机视觉中的潜力。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

Result: 在HMDB-51、UCF-101、SSv2、Kinetics-400和Kinetics-600数据集上取得最先进性能，显著优于现有方法，尤其在区分细粒度动作和处理跨模态幻觉方面。

Conclusion: Video-STAR框架在开放词汇动作识别（OVAR）中表现出色，通过子动作分解和工具增强强化学习，显著提升了细粒度动作区分和跨模态推理能力，验证了其卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索视觉语言模型如何从动态人类动作中恢复象似性映射，而非静态上下文。

Method: 提出了视觉象似性挑战（Visual Iconicity Challenge），这是一个基于视频的基准测试，评估了13种最先进的视觉语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现，并与人类基线进行了比较。

Result: 在音位形式预测任务中，模型恢复了一些手型和位置细节，但仍低于人类表现；在透明度任务中，模型表现远低于人类基线；仅在象似性评分任务中，顶级模型与人类评分有中等相关性。

Conclusion: 研究发现验证了诊断任务的可行性，并提出了以人为中心的信号和具身学习方法，以改进多模态模型中的视觉基础。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Conclusion: InstructX框架通过统一图像和视频编辑任务，证明了在图像数据上训练可以自然衍生出视频编辑能力，且通过整合模态特定的MLLM特征，实现了单模型处理多任务的高效性能。

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现实世界视频常因采集和传输条件而遭受复杂退化，现有修复方法需专业手动选择或无法泛化处理多种退化。受专家经验启发，提出了模仿人类专业推理和处理流程的系统。

Method: 提出了MoA-VR系统，包括三个代理：退化识别、路由和修复、以及修复质量评估。构建了一个大规模高清视频退化识别基准和VLM驱动的退化识别器，引入了LLM驱动的自适应路由器，并设计了基于VLM的视频质量评估模型。

Conclusion: MoA-VR展示了结合多模态智能和模块化推理在通用视频修复系统中的潜力，通过三个协调的代理有效处理多样化和复合的退化问题。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

Method: 研究提出了定性定量分析ViT注意力汇聚点信息的方法，并提出了无需训练和基于训练的策略，以优化LLM对这些信息的利用程度。

Result: 研究发现ViT注意力汇聚点封装了图像中的高级语义概念，使LLM能更有效地进行理解和推理。

Conclusion: 通过明确利用ViT注意力汇聚点（sink tokens），研究展示了在多种LVLM和视觉推理任务中的显著改进，凸显了ViT注意力汇聚点在增强视觉推理中的未开发潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Result: 实验结果表明，SliceFine在语言和视觉任务中与最先进的PEFT方法性能相当，同时显著提高了训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析和实证研究，为参数高效微调（PEFT）提供了理论基础，并提出了一种名为SliceFine的新方法。该方法不仅性能与现有PEFT技术相当，还在训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Method: FlexTraj 采用基于点的运动表示，通过序列拼接方案实现高效训练和推理，并采用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督和对齐条件的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明，FlexTraj 在收敛速度、可控性和推理效率方面表现优异，同时在不对齐条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FlexTraj 是一个支持多粒度、对齐无关轨迹控制的视频生成框架，适用于多种应用场景，如运动克隆、拖拽式图像到视频生成等。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Method: 提出了一个三阶段渐进式训练框架：1) 通过物体定位建立空间感知；2) 通过多维度空间任务发展空间理解；3) 通过可验证奖励的强化学习加强复杂推理。

Result: SpatialLadder模型在空间推理基准测试中平均提升23.4%，超越GPT-4o和Gemini-2.0-Flash，并在域外基准测试中提升7.2%。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext 提供了一种统一的指令驱动编辑方法，实现了从细微到强烈的编辑强度的精细控制，适用于多种操作，无需特定属性的训练。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在长链反思性推理能力上表现不足，这是解决复杂现实问题的关键能力。

Method: 采用自适应混合策略优化（AHPO）训练策略，结合离线监督和在线优化，生成大规模高质量反思性推理数据集MM-HELIX-100K用于指令调优。

Result: 在MM-HELIX基准测试中，Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型的准确率提升了18.6%，并在一般数学和逻辑任务中平均性能提升了5.7%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的反思性推理能力可以通过有效学习和泛化得到显著提升，为开发更强大的MLLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个评估VideoLLMs文化意识的基准，发现模型在多种文化相关任务上表现不佳，强调了文化基础训练的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了正确评估视频大型语言模型（VideoLLMs）的文化意识，需要适当的基准。

Method: 使用人机协作框架，其中教师模型提供候选注释，训练有素的人类专家验证和纠正注释。

Result: 发现模型在规范违反、中国文化背景、非言语证据和正式非幽默语境中的表现较差。

Conclusion: 论文强调了文化基础视频语言模型训练的重要性，并提出了一个基准和框架来填补这一空白。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: ARTDECO是一种结合前馈模型和SLAM优势的3D重建框架，实现了实时、高精度的环境数字化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在实时性和准确性之间存在权衡：逐场景优化计算成本高，而前馈模型虽然实时但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: ARTDECO使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化的3D高斯分布，并设计了分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略。

Result: 在八个不同的室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO表现出了与SLAM相当的交互性能、与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO提供了一个统一的框架，结合了前馈模型的高效性和SLAM管道的可靠性，实现了实时3D重建，同时保持了高几何精度和视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了统一现有的可控视频生成任务（如首帧图像到视频、修复、扩展和插值），并克服潜在视频扩散模型中因时间模糊导致的精确帧级条件控制难题。

Method: 提出了VideoCanvas框架，采用零参数增加的In-Context Conditioning（ICC）范式，结合空间零填充和时间RoPE插值策略，解耦时空控制，解决了因果VAE的时间模糊问题。

Result: VideoCanvas在实验中显著优于现有条件范式，成为灵活统一视频生成的新标杆，并通过VideoCanvasBench验证了其性能。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas通过创新的In-Context Conditioning（ICC）范式，解决了潜在视频扩散模型中的时间模糊问题，实现了灵活统一的视频生成，并在实验中显著优于现有条件范式，确立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Method: 引入 SciVideoBench，一个包含 1,000 道多选题的基准，问题源自 25 个专业学科的科学实验视频，并通过半自动系统验证。

Result: 评估显示，当前最先进的 LMMs（如 Gemini 2.5 Pro 和 Qwen2.5-VL）在 SciVideoBench 上表现不佳，表明视频推理能力仍有显著提升空间。

Conclusion: SciVideoBench 旨在推动多模态 AI 在科学视频推理领域的进步，通过提供严谨的评估基准，揭示当前大型多模态模型（LMMs）的不足，并为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频插帧方法无法生成复杂或精细的运动，且缺乏对中间帧细节的精细控制，无法满足用户多样化意图。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer（DiT）架构作为视频生成模型，将运动控制映射为稀疏且用户友好的点表示，并将内容控制和运动控制分为两个分支进行特征编码，再通过分阶段训练策略确保模型学习多模态控制。

Result: 提出的框架在视频插帧中实现了灵活性、易用性和精细控制的平衡。

Conclusion: 多模态控制使得视觉叙事更具动态性、可定制性和上下文准确性。

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

Motivation: 现有的MLLM多采用组合式训练，难以探索多模态扩展属性，因此研究原生端到端训练的MLLM及其扩展性。

Method: 通过系统研究MLLM的设计空间和扩展属性，提出了一种原生MLLM（NaViL）及其简单高效的训练方案。

Result: 在14个多模态基准测试中，NaViL表现出与现有MLLM竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，原生MLLM（如NaViL）在性能和训练成本之间取得了最佳平衡，并通过实验验证了视觉编码器与LLM之间的正相关扩展关系。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

Conclusion: D$^2$GS框架通过深度和密度引导的Dropout策略以及距离感知的保真度增强模块，显著提升了稀疏视图条件下3D高斯泼溅的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Result: 构建了M-TRACE数据集（28.5K多模态任务和177K已验证轨迹），并开发了MATRIX Agent控制器，在三个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MATRIX模型在多个基准测试中表现优于开源和闭源的视觉语言模型，展示了其在多模态工具使用上的可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

Motivation: 传统前馈高斯溅射模型因单次前向推理性能受限，需改进以提升稀疏输入下的表现。

Method: 提出ReSplat，一种前馈循环高斯溅射模型，通过渲染误差作为反馈信号迭代优化3D高斯，无需显式计算梯度。初始化阶段使用紧凑重建模型在16倍降采样空间中生成高斯。

Result: 在多种输入视图、分辨率和数据集上，ReSplat实现了最先进的性能，同时显著减少高斯数量并提升渲染速度。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过反馈信号和紧凑重建模型，显著减少了高斯数量并提升了渲染速度，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Conclusion: DRACO框架通过分布式逐跳数据复制和零开销移动汇聚策略，有效提升了数据可用性和收集效率，为物联网数据管理提供了可扩展且高容错的解决方案。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) bridges the gap between the physical and digital
worlds, enabling seamless interaction with real-world objects via the Internet.
However, IoT systems face significant challenges in ensuring efficient data
generation, collection, and management, particularly due to the
resource-constrained and unreliable nature of connected devices, which can lead
to data loss. This paper presents DRACO (Data Replication and Collection), a
framework that integrates a distributed hop-by-hop data replication approach
with an overhead-free mobile sink-based data collection strategy. DRACO
enhances data availability, optimizes replica placement, and ensures efficient
data retrieval even under node failures and varying network densities.
Extensive ns-3 simulations demonstrate that DRACO outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques, improving data availability by up to 15% and 34%, and replica
creation by up to 18% and 40%, compared to greedy and random replication
techniques, respectively. DRACO also ensures efficient data dissemination
through optimized replica distribution and achieves superior data collection
efficiency under varying node densities and failure scenarios as compared to
commonly used uncontrolled sink mobility approaches namely random walk and
self-avoiding random walk. By addressing key IoT data management challenges,
DRACO offers a scalable and resilient solution well-suited for emerging use
cases.

Abstract: Channel Charting (CC) has emerged as a promising framework for data-driven
radio localization, yet existing approaches often struggle to scale globally
and to handle the distortions introduced by non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions. In this work, we propose a novel CC method that leverages Channel
Impulse Response (CIR) data enriched with practical features such as Time
Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Transmission Reception Point (TRP) locations,
enabling a self-supervised localization function on a global scale. The
proposed framework is further enhanced with short-interval User Equipment (UE)
displacement measurements, which improve the continuity and robustness of the
learned positioning function. Our algorithm incorporates a mechanism to
identify and mask NLoS-induced noisy measurements, leading to significant
performance gains. We present the evaluations of our proposed models in a real
5G testbed and benchmarked against centimeter-accurate Real-Time Kinematic
(RTK) positioning, in an O-RAN--based 5G network by OpenAirInterface (OAI)
software at EURECOM. It demonstrated outperforming results against the
state-of-the-art semi-supervised and self-supervised CC approaches in a
real-world scenario. The results show localization accuracies of 2-4 meters in
90% of cases, across a range of NLoS ratios. Furthermore, we provide public
datasets of CIR recordings, along with the true position labels used in this
paper's evaluation.

Abstract: As chip-to-chip silicon photonics gain traction for their bandwidth and
energy efficiency, collective communication has emerged as a critical
bottleneck in scale-up systems. Programmable photonic interconnects offer a
promising path forward: by dynamically reconfiguring the fabric, they can
establish direct, high-bandwidth optical paths between communicating endpoints
-- \emph{synchronously and guided by the structure of collective operations}
(e.g., AllReduce). However, realizing this vision -- \emph{when light bends to
the collective will} -- requires navigating a fundamental trade-off between
reconfiguration delay and the performance gains of adaptive topologies.
  In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework for adaptive
photonic scale-up domains that makes this trade-off explicit and clarifies when
reconfiguration is worthwhile. Along the way, we highlight a connection -- not
surprising but still powerful -- between the Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN)
decomposition, maximum concurrent flow (a classic measure of network
throughput), and the well-known $\alpha$-$\beta$ cost model for collectives.
Finally, we outline a research agenda in algorithm design and systems
integration that can build on this foundation.

Abstract: The evolution from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0 introduces stringent
requirements for ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) to support
human centric, intelligent, and resilient industrial systems. Sixth-generation
(6G) wireless networks aim to meet these requirements through sub-millisecond
end-to-end delays, microsecond level jitter, and near perfect reliability,
enabled by advances such as terahertz (THz) communication, reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RIS), multi-access edge computing (MEC), and AI driven
cross layer optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive review of URLLC
solutions for 6G enabled industry 5.0, organized into a structured taxonomy
including application domains, key technical enablers, design challenges, and
performance enhancements. The survey examines emerging approaches, including
digital twin integration, AI/ML based resource orchestration, Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) enabled service function chaining, and cross domain
networking, while mapping them to critical industrial scenarios such as smart
manufacturing, connected healthcare, autonomous mobility, remote control, and
next-generation mobile networks. Performance trade-offs between latency,
reliability, scalability, and energy efficiency are analyzed in the context of
representative state-of-the-art studies. Finally, the paper identifies open
challenges and outlines future research directions to realize deterministic,
secure, and sustainable URLLC architectures for Industry 5.0.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链系统的可扩展性受到低效P2P广播的限制，现有优化多集中在逻辑层，未考虑物理网络条件。

Method: BlockSDN采用分布式控制平面获取全局网络视图，图引擎进行分层聚类，以及混合宏微观邻居选择与分层广播。

Conclusion: BlockSDN通过SDN-enabled的跨层协调显著提升了区块链的可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: The scalability of blockchain systems is constrained by inefficient P2P
broadcasting, as most existing optimizations focus only on the logical layer
without considering physical network conditions. To address this, we propose
BlockSDN, the first SDN-based integrated architecture for blockchain. BlockSDN
employs a distributed control plane for a global network view, a graph engine
for hierarchical clustering, and a hybrid macro-micro neighbor selection with
hierarchical broadcasting. A dedicated simulation platform shows that BlockSDN
reduces global block synchronization time by 65% and 55% compared to Gossip and
Mercury, respectively.These results highlight the potential of SDN-enabled
cross-layer coordination to significantly enhance blockchain scalability and
performance.

TL;DR: FLEET框架结合LLM和形式化方法，优化异构机器人团队的自然语言指令协调，提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构机器人团队在自由形式自然语言指令下的协调问题，克服纯语言规划器的长时协调和幻觉问题，以及纯形式化方法的封闭世界模型限制。

Method: FLEET采用混合分散式框架，LLM前端生成任务图和机器人-任务适应矩阵，形式化后端解决最小化完成时间问题，机器人执行闭环控制。

Result: FLEET在多个自由形式语言引导的自主协调基准测试中，成功提高了异构任务中双智能体团队的成功率。消融实验显示MILP主要改善时间结构，LLM衍生的适应度对能力耦合任务至关重要。

Conclusion: FLEET框架通过结合LLM前端和形式化后端，显著提高了异构机器人团队在自由形式自然语言指令下的任务成功率，特别是在需要能力耦合的任务中。

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot teams from free-form natural-language
instructions is hard. Language-only planners struggle with long-horizon
coordination and hallucination, while purely formal methods require
closed-world models. We present FLEET, a hybrid decentralized framework that
turns language into optimized multi-robot schedules. An LLM front-end produces
(i) a task graph with durations and precedence and (ii) a capability-aware
robot--task fitness matrix; a formal back-end solves a makespan-minimization
problem while the underlying robots execute their free-form subtasks with
agentic closed-loop control. Across multiple free-form language-guided autonomy
coordination benchmarks, FLEET improves success over state of the art
generative planners on two-agent teams across heterogeneous tasks. Ablations
show that mixed integer linear programming (MILP) primarily improves temporal
structure, while LLM-derived fitness is decisive for capability-coupled tasks;
together they deliver the highest overall performance. We demonstrate the
translation to real world challenges with hardware trials using a pair of
quadruped robots with disjoint capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能车辆动态模型开发常面临信息不足的挑战，特别是在自动驾驶应用中，基于现有车辆开发时设计信息往往不可得。

Method: 基于门控循环单元（GRU）层的轻量级编码器-解码器模型，用于关联车辆未来状态与过去状态及驾驶员控制动作。

Result: 模型在极端动态条件下最大平均相对误差低于2.6%，对噪声数据表现出良好鲁棒性，且输出信号具有物理一致性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的轻量级编码器-解码器模型在极端动态条件下表现出色，最大平均相对误差低于2.6%，且对噪声输入数据具有良好鲁棒性。

Abstract: Developing a dynamic model for a high-performance vehicle is a complex
problem that requires extensive structural information about the system under
analysis. This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the
vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications,
which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle
models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper
proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit
layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured
onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that
the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic
conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data
across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely
data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical
consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral
accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.

Conclusion: HJCD-IK是一种基于GPU加速的混合求解器，通过结合方向感知的贪婪坐标下降初始化方案和雅可比抛光程序，显著提升了求解速度和准确性，并在精度-延迟Pareto前沿上持续找到解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a core problem in robotics, in which joint
configurations are found to achieve a desired end-effector pose. Although
analytical solvers are fast and efficient, they are limited to systems with low
degrees-of-freedom and specific topological structures. Numerical
optimization-based approaches are more general, but suffer from high
computational costs and frequent convergence to spurious local minima. Recent
efforts have explored the use of GPUs to combine sampling and optimization to
enhance both the accuracy and speed of IK solvers. We build on this recent
literature and introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid
solver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent
initialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design
enables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as
compared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the
accuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains.
In addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples,
yielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy. We release our code open-source
for the benefit of the community.

Motivation: 传统方法将灵巧操作任务分解为独立优化的子任务，导致性能受限且计算成本高。

Method: 提出Amortized Value Optimization (AVO)，引入学习的价值函数预测未来任务性能，并将其纳入轨迹优化成本中。

Result: 在螺丝刀抓取和旋转任务中，AVO在仿真和真实实验中均表现优异，即使计算预算减少50%仍优于传统方法。

Conclusion: AVO通过引入学习的价值函数，有效提升了灵巧操作任务的性能，并在计算资源有限的情况下仍表现出色。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation tasks often require switching between different
contact modes, such as rolling, sliding, sticking, or non-contact contact
modes. When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory
optimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into
sub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.
Optimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing
contact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about
future sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging
to make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks
is very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose
Amortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function
that predicts the total future task performance. By incorporating this value
function into the cost of the trajectory optimization at each planning step,
the value function gradients guide the optimizer toward states that minimize
the cost in future sub-tasks. This effectively bridges separately optimized
sub-tasks, and accelerates the optimization by reducing the amount of online
computation needed. We validate AVO on a screwdriver grasping and turning task
in both simulation and real world experiments, and show improved performance
even with 50% less computational budget compared to trajectory optimization
without the value function.

TL;DR: IPIM 方法通过使检查规划器完全使用神经 SDFs 表示，显著减少内存使用（高达 70 倍），同时保持轨迹质量与现有最优方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于采样的检查规划器通常需要大量内存，尤其是在处理大型复杂结构时。虽然隐式模型（如神经 SDFs）可以高效表示这些结构，但现有原始计算主要针对显式模型设计，导致规划器仍需使用显式模型或频繁进行隐式与显式模型转换。

Result: 在包括一个具有超过 9200 万三角网格面的复杂真实世界结构在内的三个场景中评估表明，即使是一个初步的基于采样的规划器使用 IPIM，也能生成与现有最优方法质量相当的检查轨迹，同时内存使用减少高达 70 倍。

Conclusion: IPIM 方法使得基于采样的检查规划器能够完全使用神经 SDFs 表示，显著减少了内存使用（高达 70 倍），同时生成的检查轨迹质量与现有最优方法相当。

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient
inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based
motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require
huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is
large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry
and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit
models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most
primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been
designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn
requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent
transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during
planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called
Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable
sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation
during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a
complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates
that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate
inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the
state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the
state-of-the-art inspection planner.

TL;DR: GATO是一个GPU加速的批量轨迹优化求解器，针对中等批量大小问题，通过多级并行设计实现实时性能，比现有方法快18-21倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GPU加速方法在实时批量求解中等规模（几十到几百个）问题时存在性能不足，GATO填补了这一空白。

Method: GATO通过算法、软件和计算硬件的协同设计，利用块级、warp级和线程级并行性，在单个求解和批量求解中实现超高性能。

Result: 模拟基准测试显示，GATO在批量大小增加时比CPU基线快18-21倍，比GPU基线快1.4-16倍；硬件验证也证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: GATO是一个开源、GPU加速的批量轨迹优化求解器，能够在中等批量大小范围内实现实时吞吐量，显著提升了计算性能。

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) delivers strong performance across
robotics applications, solving the underlying (batches of) nonlinear trajectory
optimization (TO) problems online remains computationally demanding. Existing
GPU-accelerated approaches typically (i) parallelize a single solve to meet
real-time deadlines, (ii) scale to very large batches at slower-than-real-time
rates, or (iii) achieve speed by restricting model generality (e.g., point-mass
dynamics or a single linearization). This leaves a large gap in solver
performance for many state-of-the-art MPC applications that require real-time
batches of tens to low-hundreds of solves. As such, we present GATO, an open
source, GPU-accelerated, batched TO solver co-designed across algorithm,
software, and computational hardware to deliver real-time throughput for these
moderate batch size regimes. Our approach leverages a combination of block-,
warp-, and thread-level parallelism within and across solves for ultra-high
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
combination of: simulated benchmarks showing speedups of 18-21x over CPU
baselines and 1.4-16x over GPU baselines as batch size increases; case studies
highlighting improved disturbance rejection and convergence behavior; and
finally a validation on hardware using an industrial manipulator. We open
source GATO to support reproducibility and adoption.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维配置空间中实时和大规模顺序机器人操作任务的碰撞自由轨迹问题，克服CPU-GPU数据传输开销和复杂逻辑导致的性能限制。

Method: SPaSM采用两阶段粒子优化策略：首先通过大规模并行采样解决放置约束，然后将解决方案提升到关节空间中的完整轨迹优化。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，SPaSM实现了毫秒级的解决方案时间，且成功率为100%。

Conclusion: SPaSM通过完全GPU并行化的框架，实现了毫秒级的解决方案时间，相比现有方法速度提升了4000倍，且成功率高达100%。

Abstract: Sequential robot manipulation tasks require finding collision-free
trajectories that satisfy geometric constraints across multiple object
interactions in potentially high-dimensional configuration spaces. Solving
these problems in real-time and at large scales has remained out of reach due
to computational requirements. Recently, GPU-based acceleration has shown
promising results, but prior methods achieve limited performance due to CPU-GPU
data transfer overhead and complex logic that prevents full hardware
utilization. To this end, we present SPaSM (Sampling Particle optimization for
Sequential Manipulation), a fully GPU-parallelized framework that compiles
constraint evaluation, sampling, and gradient-based optimization into optimized
CUDA kernels for end-to-end trajectory optimization without CPU coordination.
The method consists of a two-stage particle optimization strategy: first
solving placement constraints through massively parallel sampling, then lifting
solutions to full trajectory optimization in joint space. Unlike hierarchical
approaches, SPaSM jointly optimizes object placements and robot trajectories to
handle scenarios where motion feasibility constrains placement options.
Experimental evaluation on challenging benchmarks demonstrates solution times
in the realm of $\textbf{milliseconds}$ with a 100% success rate; a
$4000\times$ speedup compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: EB-MBD通过逐步引入屏障约束优化Model-Based Diffusion，显著提升性能并减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-Based Diffusion中的约束可能导致灾难性的性能下降，即使在简单的2D系统中，由于蒙特卡洛近似得分函数的样本效率低下。

Method: 引入Emerging-Barrier Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD)，使用逐步引入的屏障约束来避免样本效率低下的问题，并通过分析每次迭代的采样活跃度来指导屏障参数调度选择。

Result: EB-MBD在2D碰撞避免和3D水下机械手系统中表现优于Model-Based Diffusion，且计算时间比基于投影的方法少几个数量级。

Conclusion: EB-MBD通过逐步引入屏障约束显著提高了解决方案质量，避免了计算昂贵的操作（如投影），并在2D碰撞避免和3D水下机械手系统中实现了比Model-Based Diffusion更低的成本解决方案和更少的计算时间。

Abstract: We propose enforcing constraints on Model-Based Diffusion by introducing
emerging barrier functions inspired by interior point methods. We show that
constraints on Model-Based Diffusion can lead to catastrophic performance
degradation, even on simple 2D systems due to sample inefficiency in the Monte
Carlo approximation of the score function. We introduce Emerging-Barrier
Model-Based Diffusion (EB-MBD) which uses progressively introduced barrier
constraints to avoid these problems, significantly improving solution quality,
without the need for computationally expensive operations such as projections.
We analyze the sampling liveliness of samples each iteration to inform barrier
parameter scheduling choice. We demonstrate results for 2D collision avoidance
and a 3D underwater manipulator system and show that our method achieves lower
cost solutions than Model-Based Diffusion, and requires orders of magnitude
less computation time than projection based methods.

Abstract: We address the challenge of enabling bipedal robots to traverse rough terrain
by developing probabilistically safe planning and control strategies that
ensure dynamic feasibility and centroidal robustness under terrain uncertainty.
Specifically, we propose a high-level Model Predictive Control (MPC) navigation
framework for a bipedal robot with a specified confidence level of safety that
(i) enables safe traversal toward a desired goal location across a terrain map
with uncertain elevations, and (ii) formally incorporates uncertainty bounds
into the centroidal dynamics of locomotion control. To model the rough terrain,
we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to estimate elevation maps and
leverage Conformal Prediction (CP) to construct calibrated confidence intervals
that capture the true terrain elevation. Building on this, we formulate
contraction-based reachable tubes that explicitly account for terrain
uncertainty, ensuring state convergence and tube invariance. In addition, we
introduce a contraction-based flywheel torque control law for the reduced-order
Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), which stabilizes the angular momentum
about the center-of-mass (CoM). This formulation provides both probabilistic
safety and goal reachability guarantees. For a given confidence level, we
establish the forward invariance of the proposed torque control law by
demonstrating exponential stabilization of the actual CoM phase-space
trajectory and the desired trajectory prescribed by the high-level planner.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our planning framework through
physics-based simulations of the Digit bipedal robot in MuJoCo.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种组件无关的幻觉注入框架，用于模拟自动驾驶汽车感知失败，并通过大规模模拟验证其对安全的影响，为加速AV安全验证提供了工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车（AV）的感知失败是许多事故的基础，因此研究这些失败如何影响安全至关重要。然而，现有的故障注入研究往往针对单一传感器或机器感知模块，导致难以推广或集成到统一模拟环境中的孤立框架。

Method: 本研究通过将感知失败重新定义为幻觉，即扭曲自动驾驶汽车情境感知并可能触发不安全控制行为的虚假感知，提出了一种可配置、组件无关的幻觉注入框架。该框架在开源模拟器中诱导了六种可能的幻觉类型，并执行了超过18,350次模拟。

Result: 结果表明，某些幻觉类型（如感知延迟和漂移）显著增加了测试场景中的碰撞风险，验证了所提出的框架可以对自动驾驶系统安全进行压力测试。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个可扩展、统计验证、组件无关且完全互操作的工具集，简化并加速了自动驾驶汽车的安全验证，包括那些具有新型机器感知架构和组件的验证。它有望缩短自动驾驶汽车的上市时间，并为未来关于容错和弹性自动驾驶设计的研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern
because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures
affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or
software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection
studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,
resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate
into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by
reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort
an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since
hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables
analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how
their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we
propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework
that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source
simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations
were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.
The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of
each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,
such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of
collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress
the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,
component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and
accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and
components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the
foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.

Abstract: Robotic Process Mining focuses on the identification of the routine types
performed by human resources through a User Interface. The ultimate goal is to
discover routine-type models to enable robotic process automation. The
discovery of routine-type models requires the provision of a routine log.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing works do not directly focus on
enabling the model discovery, limiting themselves to extracting the set of
actions that are part of the routines. They were also not evaluated in
scenarios characterized by inconsistent routine execution, hereafter referred
to as noise, which reflects natural variability and occasional errors in human
performance. This paper presents a clustering-based technique that aims to
extract routine logs. Experiments were conducted on nine UI logs from the
literature with different levels of injected noise. Our technique was compared
with existing techniques, most of which are not meant to discover routine logs
but were adapted for the purpose. The results were evaluated through standard
state-of-the-art metrics, showing that we can extract more accurate routine
logs than what the state of the art could, especially in the presence of noise.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a
promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment
gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired
datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization.
We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment
Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from
human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as
sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion
cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics.
Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs,
TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos
and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment
skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on
simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD
by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment
success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation
tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.

Method: IntentionVLA 采用课程训练范式，首先利用精心设计的推理数据进行预训练，赋予模型推理和感知能力，然后在微调阶段使用紧凑的推理输出作为动作生成的上下文指导。

Result: 实验结果显示，IntentionVLA 在直接指令任务中比基准模型 π₀ 高出 18% 的成功率，在意图指令任务中比 ECoT 高出 28%。在分布外意图任务中，其成功率是其他基准模型的两倍以上，并实现了零样本人机交互 40% 的成功率。

Conclusion: IntentionVLA 提出了一种新的 VLA 框架，通过课程训练和高效推理机制，显著提升了在隐含人类意图推理任务中的表现，为下一代人机交互系统提供了有前景的范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

TL;DR: GM3是一个基于轮胎刷的物理模型，统一捕捉微移动车辆的动态特性，如轮胎滑移和负载转移，并通过实证验证证明了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流工具依赖运动自行车模型（KBM）或特定模式的物理模型，忽略了轮胎滑移、负载转移和骑手/车辆倾斜等动态特性，缺乏统一的物理基础模型来覆盖所有常见MMV和轮式布局。

Method: 提出了“广义微移动模型”（GM3），基于轮胎刷表示法，支持任意轮式配置。开发了一个交互式模型无关的仿真框架，包括固定步长RK4积分、人在回路和脚本控制、实时轨迹跟踪和分析日志。

Result: GM3在斯坦福无人机数据集的roundabout场景中，针对骑行者、滑板者和推车类进行了实证验证，展示了其在不同MMV上的适用性。

Conclusion: GM3模型通过轮胎刷表示法，成功捕捉了不同微移动车辆（MMV）的动态特性，包括轮胎滑移、负载转移和骑手/车辆倾斜，为自动驾驶系统训练和城市交通模拟提供了更准确的物理基础模型。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of micro-mobility vehicles (MMV) is becoming
increasingly important for training autonomous vehicle systems and building
urban traffic simulations. However, mainstream tools rely on variants of the
Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) or mode-specific physics that miss tire slip,
load transfer, and rider/vehicle lean. To our knowledge, no unified,
physics-based model captures these dynamics across the full range of common
MMVs and wheel layouts. We propose the "Generalized Micro-mobility Model"
(GM3), a tire-level formulation based on the tire brush representation that
supports arbitrary wheel configurations, including single/double track and
multi-wheel platforms. We introduce an interactive model-agnostic simulation
framework that decouples vehicle/layout specification from dynamics to compare
the GM3 with the KBM and other models, consisting of fixed step RK4
integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control, real-time trajectory
traces and logging for analysis. We also empirically validate the GM3 on the
Stanford Drone Dataset's deathCircle (roundabout) scene for biker, skater, and
cart classes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DM1通过分散正则化解决了基于流策略的表示崩溃问题，显著提升了机器人操作的效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于流的策略存在表示崩溃问题，无法区分相似的视觉表示，导致精确操作任务失败。DM1旨在通过分散正则化解决这一问题，同时保持一步生成的高效性。

Method: DM1在MeanFlow框架中集成了分散正则化，通过在多个中间嵌入层应用不同的正则化变体，鼓励训练批次中的多样性表示，无需引入额外的网络模块或专门的训练过程。

Result: 在RoboMimic基准测试中，DM1实现了20-40倍的推理速度提升（0.07秒 vs. 2-3.5秒），并将成功率提高了10-20个百分点。在Lift任务中，成功率达到了99%，远超基线方法的85%。

Conclusion: DM1通过引入分散正则化，有效解决了基于流的策略中的表示崩溃问题，实现了高效且鲁棒的机器人操作，为多模态动作分布学习提供了一种简单而强大的方法。

Abstract: The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for
robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based
generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning
distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus
achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.
However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the
inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in
precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive
Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching
framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent
collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive
regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,
encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing
additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on
RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s
vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the
Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment
on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from
simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based
policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a
simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境对机器人操作提出了独特挑战，包括复杂的流体动力学、有限的可见性和受限的通信。尽管数据驱动方法在陆地机器人中推动了具身智能，并实现了任务特定的自主水下机器人，但开发能够自主执行多任务的水下智能仍极具挑战性，因为大规模、高质量的水下数据集仍然稀缺。

Method: 提出了U0，一个用于通用水下机器人的VLA模型，通过多模态融合整合双目视觉和其他传感器模态，并进一步结合基于卷积-注意力的感知焦点增强模块（CAP）以改善空间理解和移动操作。

Result: 在诸如检查、避障、扫描和动态跟踪等任务中，该框架的成功率达到80%，而在具有挑战性的移动操作任务中，与基线方法相比，其到目标的距离减少了21.2%，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: USIM和U0表明，VLA模型可以有效地应用于水下机器人应用，为可扩展的数据集构建、改进的任务自主性和智能通用水下机器人的实际实现提供了基础。

Abstract: Underwater environments present unique challenges for robotic operation,
including complex hydrodynamics, limited visibility, and constrained
communication. Although data-driven approaches have advanced embodied
intelligence in terrestrial robots and enabled task-specific autonomous
underwater robots, developing underwater intelligence capable of autonomously
performing multiple tasks remains highly challenging, as large-scale,
high-quality underwater datasets are still scarce. To address these
limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots. USIM comprises over
561K frames from 1,852 trajectories, totaling approximately 15.6 hours of
BlueROV2 interactions across 20 tasks in 9 diverse scenarios, ranging from
visual navigation to mobile manipulation. Building upon this dataset, we
propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates
binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and
further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement
module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across
tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking,
the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile
manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared
with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness. USIM and U0 show that
VLA models can be effectively applied to underwater robotic applications,
providing a foundation for scalable dataset construction, improved task
autonomy, and the practical realization of intelligent general underwater
robots.

Motivation: 开发能够在动态人类环境中安全、高效且符合社交规范导航的自主代理系统。

Method: 基于Falcon模型，引入Proactive Risk Perception Module，通过学习预测周围人类的碰撞风险评分，增强空间感知和主动避碰行为。

Result: 在Social-HM3D基准测试中，该方法有效提升了代理在拥挤室内场景中保持个人空间合规性的能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的Proactive Risk Perception Module显著提升了机器人在动态人类环境中的社交导航性能，在IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge中取得了第二名的成绩。

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在双足人形机器人长时任务中的规划能力有限，主要由于缺乏系统仿真平台和模型对具身意识的不足。

Method: 提出了DualTHOR仿真平台（包含连续过渡和应急机制）和Proprio-MLLM模型（通过运动位置嵌入和跨空间编码器增强具身意识）。

Result: Proprio-MLLM在规划性能上平均提升了19.75%，显著优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了DualTHOR仿真平台和Proprio-MLLM模型，显著提升了双足人形机器人在长时任务中的规划性能，为具身智能的发展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
the ability to serve as high-level planners, enabling robots to follow complex
human instructions. However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon
tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation
arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that
systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots,
and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders
reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To
address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator,
with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this
platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness
by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position
embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing
MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average
improvement of 19.75% in planning performance. Our work provides both an
essential simulation platform and an effective model to advance embodied
intelligence in humanoid robotics. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLM）在语义推理和任务规划方面表现出色，但其高级理解与实际物理执行之间仍存在显著差距，阻碍了机器人在非结构化环境中的精确操作。

Method: GRACE框架通过引入可执行分析概念（EAC），将自然语言指令和视觉信息转化为实例化的EAC，从而推导抓取姿态、力方向和物理可行的运动轨迹。

Result: GRACE在模拟和真实环境中对多种铰接物体表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: GRACE框架通过将VLM的语义推理与可执行的物理概念相结合，成功弥合了语义到物理执行的鸿沟，实现了在非结构化环境中的精确和通用化机器人操作。

Abstract: Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in
unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their
high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for
real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we
introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction
understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and
generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization
across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world
environments, without requiring task-specific training.

TL;DR: 提出角度轴空间表示法解决SO(3)方向学习问题，通过加权平均机制融合多约束轨迹，实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SO(3)是非欧几里得流形，其几何特性导致局部约束的纳入存在困难，尤其是同时纳入多个约束时。

Method: 提出了一种基于角度轴表示法的加权平均机制，通过在不同基点考虑不同局部约束生成多条轨迹，再融合为平滑轨迹。

Result: 方法在仿真和实验中表现优异，不仅能适应任意期望路径点并处理角加速度约束，还能同时纳入多个约束以降低成本。

Conclusion: 提出的基于角度轴空间的方法有效解决了SO(3)空间中的方向学习问题，能够同时纳入多个局部约束，并在仿真和实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Orientation learning plays a pivotal role in many tasks. However, the
rotation group SO(3) is a Riemannian manifold. As a result, the distortion
caused by non-Euclidean geometric nature introduces difficulties to the
incorporation of local constraints, especially for the simultaneous
incorporation of multiple local constraints. To address this issue, we propose
the Angle-Axis Space-based orientation representation method to solve several
orientation learning problems, including orientation adaptation and
minimization of angular acceleration. Specifically, we propose a weighted
average mechanism in SO(3) based on the angle-axis representation method. Our
main idea is to generate multiple trajectories by considering different local
constraints at different basepoints. Then these multiple trajectories are fused
to generate a smooth trajectory by our proposed weighted average mechanism,
achieving the goal to incorporate multiple local constraints simultaneously.
Compared with existing solution, ours can address the distortion issue and make
the off-theshelf Euclidean learning algorithm be re-applicable in non-Euclidean
space. Simulation and Experimental evaluations validate that our solution can
not only adapt orientations towards arbitrary desired via-points and cope with
angular acceleration constraints, but also incorporate multiple local
constraints simultaneously to achieve extra benefits, e.g., achieving smaller
acceleration costs.

to fulfill the diverse requirements of real-world robot demonstration data.
Specifically, FastUMI-100K contains over 100K+ demonstration trajectories

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced reasoning abilities,
enabling robots to understand natural language instructions and generate
high-level plans with appropriate grounding. However, LLM hallucinations
present a significant challenge, often leading to overconfident yet potentially
misaligned or unsafe plans. While researchers have explored uncertainty
estimation to improve the reliability of LLM-based planning, existing studies
have not sufficiently differentiated between epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, limiting the effectiveness of uncertainty estimation. In this
paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied
planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic
uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is
subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation.
The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network
distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM
features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings:
kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments. The results show
that, compared to existing methods, our approach yields uncertainty estimates
that are more closely aligned with the actual execution outcomes.

Abstract: Liver disease is a major global health burden. While ultrasound is the
first-line diagnostic tool, liver sonography requires locating multiple
non-continuous planes from positions where target structures are often not
visible, for biometric assessment and lesion detection, requiring significant
expertise. However, expert sonographers are severely scarce in resource-limited
regions. Here, we develop an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot comprising
an AI agent that integrates multi-modal perception with memory attention for
localization of unseen target structures, and a 588-gram 6-degrees-of-freedom
cable-driven robot. By mounting on the abdomen, the system enhances robustness
against motion. Our robot can autonomously acquire expert-level standard liver
ultrasound planes and detect pathology in patients, including two from Xining,
a 2261-meter-altitude city with limited medical resources. Our system performs
effectively on rapid-motion individuals and in wilderness environments. This
work represents the first demonstration of autonomous sonography across
multiple challenging scenarios, potentially transforming access to expert-level

underconstrained systems with limited time discretization. A comparative
analysis is conducted between classical PID controllers and modern

*Filip Bečanović,Kosta Jovanović,Vincent Bonnet*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种快速且鲁棒的单级重构逆最优控制方法，显著提升了计算效率并保持了结果的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IOC方法要么计算速度慢（双层过程），要么对噪声敏感（基于最优性条件的最小化），因此需要一种既快速又鲁棒的新方法。

Method: 通过单级重构将传统的双层IOC方法转化为单级优化问题，利用数值实验在仿真中验证了方法的鲁棒性和计算效率。

Result: 单级重构方法在噪声环境下表现稳健，计算时间比传统双层方法缩短了15倍。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于单级重构的逆最优控制（IOC）方法，相比传统的双层方法，该方法在保持结果等效的同时显著提高了计算速度，并在噪声环境下表现出较强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) allows the retrieval of optimal cost function
weights, or behavioral parameters, from human motion. The literature on IOC
uses methods that are either based on a slow bilevel process or a fast but
noise-sensitive minimization of optimality condition violation. Assuming
equality-constrained optimal control models of human motion, this article
presents a faster but robust approach to solving IOC using a single-level
reformulation of the bilevel method and yields equivalent results. Through
numerical experiments in simulation, we analyze the robustness to noise of the
proposed single-level reformulation to the bilevel IOC formulation with a
human-like planar reaching task that is used across recent studies. The
approach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the
computation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a
classical bilevel implementation.

Result: 该方法能有效验证CFS的安全性，并扩展至其他空间并联操纵器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过CAD软件的API自动化验证6-6 Stewart-Gough平台操纵器（SGPM）在给定移动平台（MP）方向下的最大无碰撞球体（CFS）尺寸，确保无碰撞操作。

Abstract: This paper presents a method of validation of the size of the largest
collision-free sphere (CFS) of a 6-6 Stewart-Gough platform manipulator (SGPM)
for a given orientation of its moving platform (MP) using the Application
Programming Interface (API) of a CAD software. The position of the MP is
updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell
enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair
of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or
validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision
between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a
precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel
manipulator.

TL;DR: GLUESTICK是一种无需额外训练的后剪枝恢复方法，通过权重插值校正项恢复剪枝VLA模型的功能，提升内存效率并减少安全违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管剪枝技术已成功压缩大型语言模型，但在机器人领域的应用仍未被充分研究，且剪枝视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型会导致性能急剧下降和安全违规增加。

Method: GLUESTICK通过在权重空间中对密集模型和剪枝模型进行一次插值来计算校正项，推断时由每个剪枝层使用该校正项以最小开销恢复丢失的能力。

Result: GLUESTICK在多种VLA架构和任务中实现了竞争性的内存效率，同时显著恢复了成功率并减少了安全违规。

Conclusion: GLUESTICK是一种后剪枝恢复方法，能够在保持稀疏性优势的同时恢复原始模型的大部分功能，适用于资源有限的硬件部署。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic capabilities but
remain challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning has enabled
efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely
understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models
leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce
GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original
model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a
one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to
compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each
pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK
requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and
introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between
efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in
manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency
while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion

rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the

Conclusion: R2RGen框架通过直接从真实世界数据生成3D点云观测-动作对，显著提升了数据效率，并在移动操作中展示了强大的扩展和应用潜力。

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的框架，通过联合动态模型和数据高效的自适应策略，成功实现了从仿真到现实的广泛泛化，解决了机器人手部操作中的复杂动态问题。

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

Motivation: 解决机器人零样本执行新操作任务的挑战，克服现有方法对任务分布或特定训练数据的依赖，实现跨平台的自然迁移。

Method: NovaFlow利用视频生成模型合成任务视频，并通过感知模块提取3D可操作对象流，进而计算相对位姿并实现为机器人动作。对于刚性物体，采用抓取提议和轨迹优化；对于可变形物体，采用基于粒子的动力学模型进行跟踪。

Conclusion: NovaFlow框架通过将任务描述转化为可执行计划，实现了跨平台零样本操作，无需演示或特定训练。

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

Conclusion: 当前对驾驶策略的评估实践和指标的有效性存在疑问，基于认知不确定性的离线指标在模拟和现实环境中均显示出显著改进。

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

Conclusion: BLAZER框架通过自动生成训练数据显著提升了零样本操作的性能，并在模拟和真实环境中均表现出色，同时支持LLM模型的缩小化。

Abstract: Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress
of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in
robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop
more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,
robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic
tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically
suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this
problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies
from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot
capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for
diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to
finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human
supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's
state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based
manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly
improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.
Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables
downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on
the project page.

Motivation: 解决在不同度量下对相同n个点进行中心聚类任务的聚合问题，目标是优化聚类成本的聚合（如平均值或最大值）。

Method: 提出了基于参数k和T的f(k,T)poly(n)时间3-近似算法，以及在度量具有有界ε-散射维数或由树宽有界的图诱导时的EPAS。

Result: 展示了问题的不可近似性（T≥3）和可近似性（T=2），并提供了高效参数化近似方案。

Conclusion: 对于T≥3的聚合聚类问题，多项式时间内无法近似到有限因子；对于T=2，给出了常数因子近似解。当度量具有特定结构时，获得了高效的参数化近似方案（EPAS）。

Abstract: We introduce the aggregated clustering problem, where one is given $T$
instances of a center-based clustering task over the same $n$ points, but under
different metrics. The goal is to open $k$ centers to minimize an aggregate of
the clustering costs -- e.g., the average or maximum -- where the cost is
measured via $k$-center/median/means objectives. More generally, we minimize a
norm $\Psi$ over the $T$ cost values.
  We show that for $T \geq 3$, the problem is inapproximable to any finite
factor in polynomial time. For $T = 2$, we give constant-factor approximations.
We also show W[2]-hardness when parameterized by $k$, but obtain
$f(k,T)\mathrm{poly}(n)$-time 3-approximations when parameterized by both $k$
and $T$.
  When the metrics have structure, we obtain efficient parameterized
approximation schemes (EPAS). If all $T$ metrics have bounded
$\varepsilon$-scatter dimension, we achieve a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
in $f(k,T,\varepsilon)\mathrm{poly}(n)$ time. If the metrics are induced by
edge weights on a common graph $G$ of bounded treewidth $\mathsf{tw}$, and
$\Psi$ is the sum function, we get an EPAS in
$f(T,\varepsilon,\mathsf{tw})\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ time. Conversely, unless
(randomized) ETH is false, any finite factor approximation is impossible if
parametrized by only $T$, even when the treewidth is $\mathsf{tw} =
\Omega(\mathrm{poly}\log n)$.

Result: 研究表明，所有考虑的问题在参数化组合vimw + k + ℓ下均存在FPT算法。此外，时间轴支配集问题在imw + k + ℓ参数组合下也存在FPT算法，而时间轴顶点覆盖问题在该组合下即使参数为常数也是NP难解的。

Abstract: A temporal graph is a finite sequence of graphs, called snapshots, over the
same vertex set. Many temporal graph problems turn out to be much more
difficult than their static counterparts. One such problem is \textsc{Timeline
Vertex Cover} (also known as \textsc{MinTimeline$_\infty$}), a temporal
analogue to the classical \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem. In this problem, one
is given a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ and two integers $k$ and $\ell$, and
the goal is to cover each edge of each snapshot by selecting for each vertex at
most $k$ activity intervals of length at most $\ell$ each. Here, an edge $uv$
in the $i$th snapshot is covered, if an activity interval of $u$ or $v$ is
active at time $i$. In this work, we continue the algorithmic study of
\textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover} and introduce the \textsc{Timeline Dominating
Set} problem where we want to dominate all vertices in each snapshot by the
selected activity intervals.
  We analyze both problems from a classical and parameterized point of view and
also consider partial problem versions, where the goal is to cover (dominate)
at least $t$ edges (vertices) of the snapshots. With respect to the
parameterized complexity, we consider the temporal graph parameters
vertex-interval-membership-width $(vimw)$ and interval-membership-width
$(imw)$. We show that all considered problems admit FPT-algorithms when
parameterized by $vimw + k+\ell$. This provides a smaller parameter combination
than the ones used for previously known FPT-algorithms for \textsc{Timeline
Vertex Cover}. Surprisingly, for $imw+ k+\ell$, \textsc{Timeline Dominating
Set} turns out to be easier than \textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover}, by also
admitting an FPT-algorithm, whereas the vertex cover version is NP-hard even if
$imw+\, k+\ell$ is constant. We also consider parameterization by combinations
of $n$, the vertex set size, with $k$ or $\ell$ and parameterization by $t$.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的动态连通性算法，基于核心图框架，实现了多对数级的最坏情况更新时间复杂度，并展示了算法的高效确定性实现。

Abstract: Whether a graph $G=(V,E)$ is connected is arguably its most fundamental
property. Naturally, connectivity was the first characteristic studied for
dynamic graphs, i.e. graphs that undergo edge insertions and deletions. While
connectivity algorithms with polylogarithmic amortized update time have been
known since the 90s, achieving worst-case guarantees has proven more elusive.
  Two recent breakthroughs have made important progress on this question: (1)
Kapron, King and Mountjoy [SODA'13; Best Paper] gave a Monte-Carlo algorithm
with polylogarithmic worst-case update time, and (2) Nanongkai, Saranurak and
Wulff-Nilsen [STOC'17, FOCS'17] obtained a Las-Vegas data structure, however,
with subpolynomial worst-case update time. Their algorithm was subsequently
de-randomized [FOCS'20].
  In this article, we present a new dynamic connectivity algorithm based on the
popular core graph framework that maintains a hierarchy interleaving vertex and
edge sparsification. Previous dynamic implementations of the core graph
framework required subpolynomial update time. In contrast, we show how to
implement it for dynamic connectivity with polylogarithmic expected worst-case
update time.
  We further show that the algorithm can be de-randomized efficiently: a
deterministic static algorithm for computing a connectivity edge-sparsifier of
low congestion in time $T(m) \cdot m$ on an $m$-edge graph yields a
deterministic dynamic connectivity algorithm with $\tilde{O}(T(m))$ worst-case
update time. Via current state-of-the-art algorithms [STOC'24], we obtain $T(m)
= m^{o(1)}$ and recover deterministic subpolynomial worst-case update time.

Method: 采用混合研究方法，结合定量（442名开发者的调查、PLS-SEM和回归分析）与定性（开放式回答分析）证据，以JD-R模型为分析框架。

Conclusion: 生成式AI（GenAI）的采用虽然提升了软件开发效率，但也增加了开发者工作压力，导致倦怠。然而，工作资源和积极态度可以缓解这种负面影响。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping software development workflows.
While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also
introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper,
we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers'
burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic
lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods
research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first
surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of
experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation
Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands,
job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of
open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results
show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job
resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing
adoption as an opportunity.

Motivation: 尽管热修复在生产系统中至关重要，但目前缺乏专门针对热修复的评估基准。HotBugs$.$jar 旨在填补这一空白，支持未来研究。

Method: 通过挖掘 10 个活跃的 Apache 项目（总计超过 190K 提交和 150K 问题报告），识别出 746 个符合热修复标准的软件补丁，经过手动评估后确认 679 个为真实热修复，其中 110 个可通过测试套件复现。基于 Bugs$.$jar 框架构建，HotBugs$.$jar 集成了这些可复现案例，并提供了所有 679 个手动验证的热修复，每个都附有丰富的元数据。

Result: 构建了首个专注于真实世界热修复的数据集 HotBugs$.$jar，包含 679 个手动验证的热修复（其中 110 个可复现），并提供了丰富的元数据和可复现格式。

Conclusion: HotBugs$.$jar 已被采纳为 Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) 会议的官方挑战数据集，展示了其在推动快速调试、自动修复和生产级弹性工具研究方面的直接影响力。

Abstract: Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to
address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation
benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the
first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10
active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we
identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual
evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are
reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework,
HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all
679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to
support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira
issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible
format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar
has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based
Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its
immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for
rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern
software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.

### [149] [RustAssure: Differential Symbolic Testing for LLM-Transpiled C-to-Rust Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07604)
*Yubo Bai,Tapti Palit*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RustAssure利用LLM自动将C代码转为Rust，通过差异符号测试验证语义相似性，实验显示高转换成功率（89.8%）和语义等效性（69.9%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了利用Rust的内存安全特性提升软件安全性，需要将现有C代码库转换为Rust，但手动转换效率低下且易出错。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLMs）和提示工程技术自动将C代码转换为Rust，并通过差异符号测试验证语义相似性。

Result: 在五个真实应用和库的评估中，RustAssure成功转换了89.8%的C函数，其中69.9%的Rust函数与原始C函数在符号返回值上等效。

Conclusion: RustAssure系统通过LLM自动将C代码转换为Rust，结合差异符号测试确保语义相似性，实验表明其能成功转换89.8%的C函数，其中69.9%的Rust函数与原始C函数在符号返回值上等效。

Abstract: Rust is a memory-safe programming language that significantly improves
software security. Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such
as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved
safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses
prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating
idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with
subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing,
RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic
similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated
RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our
system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C
functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both
the C and Rust functions.

TL;DR: APPFORGE是一个评估LLMs从头构建Android应用能力的基准测试，结果显示当前模型在复杂软件工程任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分评估LLMs是否能够从头构建完整的软件系统，而现实应用需要协调不同组件的交互、维护状态一致性并确保行为正确。

Method: 提出了APPFORGE基准测试，包含101个来自真实Android应用的软件开发问题，通过多代理系统自动总结应用文档的主要功能并合成测试用例，验证应用实现的功能正确性。

Result: 评估了12种旗舰LLMs，结果显示所有模型的有效性较低，突显了当前模型在处理复杂软件工程任务时的局限性。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理复杂、多组件的软件工程挑战时存在根本性限制，最佳表现模型（GPT-5）仅能开发18.8%功能正确的应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in
function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world
applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must
orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across
states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the
lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately
evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software
systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark
consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android
apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a
language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android
app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding
and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,
calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To
construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize
the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize
test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.
Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE
incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that
enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily
adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all
evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model
(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting
fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,
multi-component software engineering challenges.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FLEX是MLIR的自适应模糊测试框架，利用神经网络和反馈驱动增强，显著提高错误发现率和代码覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLIR作为现代编译器框架的基础技术，其正确性和鲁棒性至关重要，但现有模糊测试方法难以生成足够多样化和语义有效的测试用例，难以暴露MLIR复杂代码库中的深层错误。

Method: FLEX结合了神经网络程序生成、扰动采样策略和反馈驱动的增强循环，以迭代方式改进模型并生成高质量测试输入。

Result: 在30天的测试中，FLEX发现了80个先前未知的错误，包括多个新的根本原因和解析器错误；在24小时固定版本比较中，检测到53个错误（超过最佳基线的3.5倍），并实现了28.2%的代码覆盖率，优于次优工具42%。

Conclusion: FLEX通过其自适应的模糊测试框架，显著提升了在MLIR中发现深层和微妙错误的能力，证实了其生成多样化和语义有效测试用例的有效性。

Abstract: MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) has rapidly become a
foundational technology for modern compiler frameworks, enabling extensibility
across diverse domains. However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of
MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually
crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently
diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle
or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this
paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX
leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy
to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that
iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.
Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and
semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX
on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a
30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple
new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it
detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2%
code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies
further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity
augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.

*Lingjun Liu,Feiran Qin,Owolabi Legunsen,Marcelo d'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: IssueMut通过从编译器bug历史中提取变异器，显著提升了模糊测试的效果，发现了65个新bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器bug对现代基础设施影响巨大，传统变异模糊测试工具的效果受限于变异器的质量，而bug历史中蕴含的变异信息未被充分利用。

Method: IssueMut通过自动化方法从bug报告中提取变异器，并将其整合到现有变异编译器模糊测试工具中。

Result: 从1760个GCC和LLVM bug报告中提取了587个变异器，发现了65个新bug（28个在GCC，37个在LLVM），其中60个被确认或修复。

Conclusion: IssueMut证明了利用编译器bug历史作为变异源的有效性，能够发现传统变异模糊测试工具遗漏的bug。

Abstract: Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized
negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by
systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness
depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler
bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach
for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is
that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler
bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated
method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into
existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from
1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with
all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are
effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler
fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed,
validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler
fuzzers should leverage.

TL;DR: 研究分析了180个汽车SoC漏洞，填补了AUTOSAR架构中漏洞系统分析的空白，提出了改进安全策略的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AUTOSAR标准旨在管理复杂性，但实际中集成的SoC软件架构在实时、安全关键环境中仍面临安全挑战，缺乏对漏洞根源和影响的系统分析。

Method: 分析了180个公开报告的汽车SoC漏洞，并将其映射到一个符合AUTOSAR原则的代表性SoC软件架构模型中。

Result: 识别了16个根本原因和56个受影响的软件模块，并研究了CWE类别和架构层中的缓解延迟，揭示了主要的漏洞模式和补丁延迟严重的模块。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了AUTOSAR对齐架构中SoC漏洞系统分析的空白，提供了改进检测、优先级排序和定位策略的可操作见解，以增强汽车CPS平台的安全性。

Abstract: Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex
cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and
control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC)
platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI
accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open
System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better
manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to
facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC
software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in
real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in
SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and
impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that
gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped
to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with
AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify
16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays
across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers.
We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged
patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS
platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and
localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle
platforms.

TL;DR: 论文提出AI驱动的bug跟踪框架，利用LLM自动化减少修复时间和人工开销，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统bug跟踪系统依赖人工操作，涉及多个利益相关者，协调成本高且沟通效率低，导致从发现到修复的过程缓慢。现有系统异步性高，用户等待时间长。

Method: 框架利用自然语言处理技术，用户用自然语言报告问题，AI代理细化报告、尝试复现并请求缺失细节。报告被分类后，无效问题通过无代码修复解决，有效问题则定位并分配给开发者。LLM还生成候选补丁，人工监督确保正确性。

Result: 提出的AI框架通过在每个阶段集成自动化，加速响应时间，改善协作，并强化软件维护实践。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种AI驱动的bug跟踪框架，通过LLM驱动的自动化减少修复时间并降低人工开销，从而提升软件维护效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting,
reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different
stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This
division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the
communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the
process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly
asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying
fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug
tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS
platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking
framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model
(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing
time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural
language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request
missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through
no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also
generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By
integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response
times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices
for a more efficient, user-centric future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在软件语言工程中，模块化语言组件的重用性受到空格敏感与不敏感语言集成差距的限制，导致库无法重用且空格敏感语言需从头开发。

Method: 通过预处理语言构件，利用模块化的空格不敏感语言模块来构建空格敏感语言。

Result: 通过重构简化版Python语言，验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通过预处理语言构件来构建空格敏感语言的技术，显著提高了现有语言组件的可重用性，减少了开发时间并提升了软件语言的总体质量。

Abstract: In Software Language Engineering, there is a trend towards reusability by
composing modular language components. However, this reusability is severely
inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and
whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure
for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that
libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are
developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular,
whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive
languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is
evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language
Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language
components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of
software languages.

TL;DR: SpotDiff是一种新方法，通过正交约束分离主体特征，实现高效且高保真的个性化图像生成，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法计算成本高，而基于学习的方法效率高但受干扰因素影响。SpotDiff旨在平衡高保真度和效率，解决主体身份保留问题。

Method: 引入SpotDiff，一种基于学习的方法，通过发现和分离干扰来提取主体特定特征。利用预训练的CLIP图像编码器及姿势和背景的专家网络，通过特征空间中的正交约束隔离主体身份。

Result: 实验表明，SpotDiff在主体保留和可控编辑方面优于现有方法，且仅需10k训练样本即可达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: SpotDiff通过正交约束在特征空间中分离主体身份，结合CLIP图像编码器和专家网络，实现了更鲁棒的主体保留和可控编辑，且在仅10k训练样本下表现优异。

Abstract: Personalized image generation aims to faithfully preserve a reference
subject's identity while adapting to diverse text prompts. Existing
optimization-based methods ensure high fidelity but are computationally
expensive, while learning-based approaches offer efficiency at the cost of
entangled representations influenced by nuisance factors. We introduce
SpotDiff, a novel learning-based method that extracts subject-specific features
by spotting and disentangling interference. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP image
encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, SpotDiff
isolates subject identity through orthogonality constraints in the feature
space. To enable principled training, we introduce SpotDiff10k, a curated
dataset with consistent pose and background variations. Experiments demonstrate
that SpotDiff achieves more robust subject preservation and controllable
editing than prior methods, while attaining competitive performance with only
10k training samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于优化的扩散求解器在逆问题中表现优异，但缺乏清晰的概率基础。LMAPS 旨在为这些方法提供统一的概率解释，并提升性能。

Method: 引入 Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS)，通过迭代解决局部 MAP 子问题，并结合概率可解释的协方差近似、稳定性和可解释性的目标重构，以及对非可微分算子的梯度近似。

Result: 在图像恢复和科学任务中，LMAPS 实现了最先进的性能，包括在运动去模糊、JPEG 恢复和量化任务中 ≥2 dB 的增益，以及在逆散射基准中 >1.5 dB 的改进。

Conclusion: LMAPS 提供了一种新的推理框架，通过迭代解决扩散轨迹上的局部 MAP 子问题，为基于优化的方法提供了统一的概率解释，并在多个任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to
inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the
goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover
the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers
often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce
Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving
local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective
clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified
probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this
foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically
interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability
and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable
operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion
deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on
inverse scattering benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过可微分变量字体框架，本研究为直观和自动化的字体设计与动画工作流程开辟了新途径，利用现代设计优化技术提升了排版设计的易用性和创造性。

Abstract: Editing and animating text appearance for graphic designs, commercials, etc.
remain highly skilled tasks requiring detailed, hands on efforts from artists.
Automating these manual workflows requires balancing the competing goals of
maintaining legibility and aesthetics of text, while enabling creative
expression. Variable fonts, recent parametric extensions to traditional fonts,
offer the promise of new ways to ease and automate typographic design and
animation. Variable fonts provide custom constructed parameters along which
fonts can be smoothly varied. These parameterizations could then potentially
serve as high value continuous design spaces, opening the door to automated
design optimization tools. However, currently variable fonts are underutilized
in creative applications, because artists so far still need to manually tune
font parameters. Our work opens the door to intuitive and automated font design
and animation workflows with differentiable variable fonts. To do so we distill
the current variable font specification to a compact mathematical formulation
that differentiably connects the highly non linear, non invertible mapping of
variable font parameters to the underlying vector graphics representing the
text. This enables us to construct a differentiable framework, with respect to
variable font parameters, allowing us to perform gradient based optimization of
energies defined on vector graphics control points, and on target rasterized
images. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with four applications:
direct shape manipulation, overlap aware modeling, physics based text
animation, and automated font design optimization. Our work now enables
leveraging the carefully designed affordances of variable fonts with
differentiability to use modern design optimization technologies, opening new
possibilities for easy and intuitive typographic design workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RRS方法因路径计数不可预测，与波前路径追踪的预分配内存和调度需求不兼容。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种复杂场景中，渲染质量和性能均优于传统启发式方法和近期RRS技术。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种针对波前路径追踪的新型RRS框架，通过标准化RRS和神经网络学习RRS因子，显著提升了渲染质量和性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for Russian Roulette and Splitting (RRS)
tailored to wavefront path tracing, a highly parallel rendering architecture
that processes path states in batched, stage-wise execution for efficient GPU
utilization. Traditional RRS methods, with unpredictable path counts, are
fundamentally incompatible with wavefront's preallocated memory and scheduling
requirements. To resolve this, we introduce a normalized RRS formulation with a
bounded path count, enabling stable and memory-efficient execution.
  Furthermore, we pioneer the use of neural networks to learn RRS factors,
presenting two models: NRRS and AID-NRRS. At a high level, both feature a
carefully designed RRSNet that explicitly incorporates RRS normalization, with
only subtle differences in their implementation. To balance computational cost
and inference accuracy, we introduce Mix-Depth, a path-depth-aware mechanism
that adaptively regulates neural evaluation, further improving efficiency.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional
heuristics and recent RRS techniques in both rendering quality and performance
across a variety of complex scenes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索可变速率纹理压缩在现代GPU上的可行性，并与固定速率压缩方法BC1和ASTC进行比较。

Method: 使用延迟渲染管道识别所需块，解码并着色帧缓冲像素。

Result: JPEG在质量和压缩率上显著优于BC1，与ASTC相当或更好，且渲染时间仅增加0.3毫秒。

Conclusion: 研究表明，JPEG格式在现代GPU上实现可变速率纹理压缩是可行的，且在质量和压缩率上优于或与ASTC相当，尽管需要额外的0.17比特/像素。

Abstract: Although variable-rate compressed image formats such as JPEG are widely used
to efficiently encode images, they have not found their way into real-time
rendering due to special requirements such as random access to individual
texels. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of variable-rate texture
compression on modern GPUs using the JPEG format, and how it compares to the
GPU-friendly fixed-rate compression approaches BC1 and ASTC. Using a deferred
rendering pipeline, we are able to identify the subset of blocks that are
needed for a given frame, decode these, and colorize the framebuffer's pixels.
Despite the additional $\sim$0.17 bit per pixel that we require for our
approach, JPEG maintains significantly better quality and compression rates
compared to BC1, and depending on the type of image, outperforms or competes
with ASTC. The JPEG rendering pipeline increases rendering duration by less
than 0.3 ms on an RTX 4090, demonstrating that sophisticated variable-rate
compression schemes are feasible on modern GPUs, even in VR. Source code and

Conclusion: SViM3D通过扩展潜在视频扩散模型，实现了从单图像预测多视角一致的PBR材料，展示了在AR/VR、电影、游戏等视觉媒体中生成可重照明3D资产的能力。

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场通常在单一固定分辨率下运行，限制了其灵活性。本文旨在提出一种简单而强大的方法，优化神经场以实现预滤波。

Method: 通过分析性地缩放傅里叶特征嵌入与滤波器的频率响应，在输入域进行卷积滤波。支持训练时未见过的参数化滤波器（如Box和Lanczos）。使用单样本蒙特卡罗估计训练神经场。

Result: 在神经场滤波方面，定量和定性均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在神经场滤波方面表现出色，训练和推理速度快，且不对网络架构施加额外限制。

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically
operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method
to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key
innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the
input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the
filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond
Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that
are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample
Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both
training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network
architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing
methods for neural-field filtering.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的体积表示方法——可投影的神经基元，成功将神经模型的表现力与基于基元的投影效率相结合，在保持高质量和速度的同时显著减少了所需的基元数量和参数。

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D
scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide
high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas
primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time
efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.
Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural
primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of
neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive
encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural
network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line
integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting
kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays
without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to
scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the
number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach
matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$
fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise
directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or
adaptation frameworks. The project page is

TL;DR: X2Video是首个基于内在通道的扩散模型，支持多模态控制和参数化编辑，通过混合自注意力和递归采样生成长时间一致的高质量视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有视频生成模型在时间一致性和多模态控制方面的不足，提出了X2Video。

Method: 通过扩展XRGB模型，采用混合自注意力机制确保时间一致性，并开发掩码交叉注意力机制以分离全局和局部文本提示。递归采样方法用于生成长视频。

Result: X2Video能够生成高质量的视频，支持多模态控制和参数化编辑，定量和定性评估均表现优异。

Conclusion: X2Video能够生成长时间、时间一致且逼真的视频，同时支持多模态控制和参数化编辑。

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SmartDiff自适应调度器通过动态资源调整，显著降低延迟和内存使用，优于固定和启发式基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在固定资源预算下最小化数据处理的高延迟（p95），同时避免内存溢出并保持高吞吐量。

Method: 调度器采用两种执行模式：内存线程和基于Dask的并行处理。结合轻量级预分析器、在线成本/内存模型以及受保护的爬山策略，动态优化资源分配。

Result: 在合成和公共表格基准测试中，调度器将p95延迟降低了23%至28%（相比调优的启发式方法），峰值内存减少了16%至22%（相比固定基线）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种自适应调度器（SmartDiff），通过动态调整批处理大小和线程/工作器数量，在固定CPU和内存预算下显著降低了p95延迟，并减少了峰值内存使用，同时避免了内存溢出问题。

Abstract: We present an adaptive scheduler for a single differencing engine (SmartDiff)
with two execution modes: (i) in-memory threads and (ii) Dask based
parallelism. The scheduler continuously tunes batch size and worker/thread
count within fixed CPU and memory budgets to minimize p95 latency. A
lightweight preflight profiler estimates bytes/row and I/O rate; an online
cost/memory model prunes unsafe actions; and a guarded hill-climb policy favors
lower latency with backpressure and straggler mitigation. Backend selection is
gated by a conservative working-set estimate so that in-memory execution is
chosen when safe, otherwise Dask is used. Across synthetic and public tabular
benchmarks, the scheduler reduces p95 latency by 23 to 28 percent versus a
tuned warm-up heuristic (and by 35 to 40 percent versus fixed grid baselines),
while lowering peak memory by 16 to 22 percent (25 to 32 percent vs. fixed)
with zero OOMs and comparable throughput.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Digital Twins (DTs) in the context of the
Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) call for seamless

experimental evaluation of the DT Simulation Bridge - a software framework that
enables diverse interaction patterns between active DTs and simulation
environments. The framework supports both the DT development lifecycle and the
incorporation of simulations during active operation. Through bidirectional
data exchange, simulations can update DT models dynamically, while DTs provide
real-time feedback to adapt simulation parameters. We describe the
architectural design and core software components that ensure flexible
interoperability and scalable deployment. Experimental results show that the DT
Simulation Bridge enhances design agility, facilitates virtual commissioning,
and supports live behavioral analysis under realistic conditions, demonstrating
its effectiveness across a range of industrial scenarios.

TL;DR: 通过硬件隔离优化无服务器架构，可大幅降低能源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无服务器平台在传统服务器硬件上运行大量函数，依赖昂贵的软件隔离和过度资源预留，导致能源效率低下。

Method: 提出使用硬件隔离，每个函数分配独立处理器，替代当前的软件隔离机制。

Result: 初步评估显示，这一方法可减少能源消耗90.63%或平均70.8MW。

Conclusion: 重新设计服务器硬件架构以匹配无服务器软件的需求，尤其是通过硬件隔离而非软件隔离，可以显著提升能源效率。

Abstract: Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with
rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of
resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only
consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless
computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency.
  However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or
thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server
hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree
of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared
caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are
optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated
functions.
  We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with
the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using
hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software
isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only
when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real
hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce
energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的分布式资源选择机制在云边环境中实现了高效、可扩展且具有弹性的动态资源分配，为分布式编排系统提供了核心组件。

Abstract: This paper presents a distributed resource selection mechanism for diverse
cloud-edge environments, enabling dynamic and context-aware allocation of
resources to meet the demands of complex distributed applications. By
distributing the decision-making process, our approach ensures efficiency,
scalability, and resilience in highly dynamic cloud-edge environments where
centralised coordination becomes a bottleneck. The proposed mechanism aims to
function as a core component of a broader, distributed, and self-organising
orchestration system that facilitates the intelligent placement and adaptation
of applications in real-time. This work leverages a consensus-based mechanism
utilising local knowledge and inter-agent collaboration to achieve efficient
results without relying on a central controller, thus paving the way for
distributed orchestration. Our results indicate that computation time is the
key factor influencing allocation decisions. Our approach consistently delivers
rapid allocations without compromising optimality or incurring additional cost,
achieving timely results at scale where exhaustive search is infeasible and
centralised heuristics run up to 30 times slower.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线网络（如ad hoc无线和传感器网络）通常由电池供电，能量资源有限。因此，设计能量高效的分布式算法至关重要。本文旨在解决MIS问题在无线电模型中的能量优化挑战。

Method: 本文采用了随机化分布式算法，并针对不同无线电模型（CD和no-CD）设计了具体的算法实现。通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了算法的能量和轮复杂度。

Result: 1. CD模型：随机化分布式MIS算法，能量复杂度O(log n)，轮复杂度O(log² n)，失败概率1/poly(n)。
2. no-CD模型：随机化分布式MIS算法，能量复杂度O(log²n log log n)，轮复杂度O(log³ n log Δ)，失败概率1/poly(n)。

Conclusion: 本文提出了在无线电网络中更节能的最大独立集（MIS）算法，分别针对有碰撞检测（CD）和无碰撞检测（no-CD）的模型。在CD模型中，算法实现了能量复杂度的最优解；在no-CD模型中，算法的能量复杂度显著优于现有最佳算法。

Abstract: The maximal independent set (MIS) is one of the most fundamental problems in
distributed computing, and it has been studied intensively for over four
decades. This paper focuses on the MIS problem in the Radio Network model, a
standard model widely used to model wireless networks, particularly ad hoc
wireless and sensor networks. Energy is a premium resource in these networks,
which are typically battery-powered. Hence, designing distributed algorithms
that use as little energy as possible is crucial. We use the well-established
energy model where a node can be sleeping or awake in a round, and only the
awake rounds (when it can send or listen) determine the energy complexity of
the algorithm, which we want to minimize.
  We present new, more energy-efficient MIS algorithms in radio networks with
arbitrary and unknown graph topology. We present algorithms for two popular
variants of the radio model -- with collision detection (CD) and without
collision detection (no-CD). Specifically, we obtain the following results:
  1. CD model: We present a randomized distributed MIS algorithm with energy
complexity $O(\log n)$, round complexity $O(\log^2 n)$, and failure probability
$1 / poly(n)$, where $n$ is the network size. We show that our energy
complexity is optimal by showing a matching $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound.
  2. no-CD model: In the more challenging no-CD model, we present a randomized
distributed MIS algorithm with energy complexity $O(\log^2n \log \log n)$,
round complexity $O(\log^3 n \log \Delta)$, and failure probability $1 /
poly(n)$. The energy complexity of our algorithm is significantly lower than
the round (and energy) complexity of $O(\log^3 n)$ of the best known
distributed MIS algorithm of Davies [PODC 2023] for arbitrary graph topology.

Motivation: 现代高性能计算（HPC）日益依赖GPU，但在复杂科学框架（如OpenFOAM）中集成GPU加速仍具挑战性。现有方法在性能与开发工作量之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出了一种重新分区策略，平衡CPU矩阵组装和基于GPU的线性求解，并详细描述了计算模型及矩阵重新分区与更新过程。

Result: 在大规模CFD模拟中，该方法显著缓解了过载问题，提升了求解器性能和资源利用率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重新分区策略有效缓解了资源过载问题，显著提升了异构CPU-GPU环境下的求解器性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) increasingly relies on GPUs, but
integrating GPU acceleration into complex scientific frameworks like OpenFOAM
remains a challenge. Existing approaches either fully refactor the codebase or
use plugin-based GPU solvers, each facing trade-offs between performance and
development effort. In this work, we address the limitations of plugin-based
GPU acceleration in OpenFOAM by proposing a repartitioning strategy that better
balances CPU matrix assembly and GPU-based linear solves. We present a detailed
computational model, describe a novel matrix repartitioning and update
procedure, and evaluate its performance on large-scale CFD simulations. Our
results show that the proposed method significantly mitigates oversubscription
issues, improving solver performance and resource utilization in heterogeneous
CPU-GPU environments.

TL;DR: TAD is a decoding scheme that aligns language models with knowledge bases, reducing hallucinations via semantic guards and formal verification, without losing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Align neural language generation with knowledge bases to reduce hallucinations and enhance factual accuracy while maintaining model throughput.

Method: TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of semantic guards that operate at decode time, incorporating a constraint-based semantics, proof of local likelihood dominance, an entropy-style invariant, and a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts.

Result: Numerical and algorithmic case studies confirm that TAD's guardrails effectively reduce hallucinations without compromising throughput.

Conclusion: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) provides a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models and formal verification, reducing hallucinations without sacrificing throughput.

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网的日益集成使得关键网络物理系统面临复杂的多阶段攻击，传统防御缺乏上下文感知能力，无法有效应对。

Method: L2M-AID框架利用LLM作为语义桥梁，将非结构化遥测数据转化为丰富的上下文状态表示，并通过MARL算法MAPPO学习复杂的协作策略。奖励函数设计平衡了安全目标和操作需求，明确惩罚影响物理过程稳定性的行为。

Result: 在SWaT数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK for ICS框架生成的合成数据集上的实验表明，L2M-AID在检测率、误报率和响应时间上均显著优于传统IDS、深度学习异常检测器和单智能体RL基线。

Conclusion: L2M-AID框架通过结合LLM和MARL技术，显著提升了工业物联网的安全性，不仅在检测率上达到97.2%，还大幅降低了误报率和响应时间，同时保持了物理过程的稳定性，为关键国家基础设施的安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

Motivation: 探究思考模型为何优于基础模型，明确其是学习新能力还是利用已有能力。

Method: 提出了一种混合模型，通过适时激活基础模型中的推理机制来模拟思考模型的推理链，并引入了一种无监督、自底向上的方法来揭示可解释的推理行为。

Result: 混合模型在不更新权重的情况下，恢复了思考模型91%的性能差距，且仅需引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 思考模型（如DeepSeek R1）通过有效激活基础模型中已有的推理机制，而非学习全新能力，从而在推理任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种从静态心理健康诊断评估向连续、人工智能驱动的评估转变的框架，并提出了心理健康数字孪生（MHDTs）作为个性化心理健康护理的变革性框架。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

Conclusion: ProSEA框架展示了作为透明、自适应且与人类对齐的AI代理基础的潜力，尤其在复杂任务中表现优于现有基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

Motivation: 现有的专家混合框架（如TESTAM）缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的明确融合，限制了其空间能力。

Method: 提出了TESTAM+，一个增强的时空预测框架，引入了新型SpatioSemantic Expert，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合。

Result: TESTAM+在METR LA上实现了1.3%的MAE降低（3.10 vs. 3.14），在PEMS BAY上实现了4.1%的改进（1.65 vs. 1.72）。最优的Identity + Adaptive配置在METR LA上相比最先进的MegaCRN实现了11.5%的MAE降低（2.99 vs. 3.38），同时推理延迟减少了53.1%。

Conclusion: 研究发现，数量较少但经过战略设计的专家模型优于复杂的多专家集成，在实时部署中实现了新的最先进性能，并具有更高的计算效率。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

TL;DR: TS-Agent结合LLMs和时间序列分析工具，提升时间序列推理性能，避免幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，常出现幻觉或知识泄漏问题。

Method: 提出TS-Agent，利用LLMs进行证据收集和结论合成，同时将统计和结构信息提取委托给时间序列分析工具，通过原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，并记录证据日志。

Result: TS-Agent在理解基准测试中表现与最先进的LLMs相当，在推理任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过将时间序列分析与LLMs的推理能力结合，显著提升了时间序列推理任务的性能，同时避免了幻觉或知识泄漏问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 探索LLM在交互式对话中理解流程模型、发现错误及深度推理的潜力，评估其作为业务流程设计助手的可行性。

Method: 通过实验评估多个LLM在理解BPMN流程模型、发现错误及深度推理方面的能力，重点关注ChatGPT（model o3）在零样本设置下的表现。

Result: LLM（尤其是ChatGPT）能够有效理解BPMN模型并进行智能查询回答，不同模型表现不一，但整体上展现出作为流程设计助手的潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs，尤其是像ChatGPT这样的未经过专门训练的模型，在零样本设置下能够有效理解BPMN流程模型，并在句法、逻辑和语义层面进行智能查询回答。不同LLM在准确性和有效性上表现各异，但它们可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手。此外，LLM在流程分析和优化中展现出类人化的思考能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决基于LLMs的顺序多智能体系统难以信任的问题，因为错误会悄无声息地从一个阶段传递到下一个阶段。

Method: 研究评估了三种最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）在三个基准测试上的八种配置，并分析错误起源、传播及修复方式。

Result: 结果显示：(1) 在智能体之间添加结构化、可问责的交接显著提高了准确性；(2) 模型具有明确的角色特定优势和风险；(3) 准确性-成本-延迟的权衡取决于任务。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法，用于设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测且可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 随着医学智能系统（MIS）在医疗工作流程中的广泛应用，其安全性和伦理问题日益突出。根据欧盟AI法案，大多数MIS被归类为高风险系统，需进行正式的风险管理以确保符合可信AI的伦理要求。

Method: 研究采用了混合整数规划（MIP）、可满足性（SAT）和约束编程（CP）三种解决范式，并通过Minizinc约束建模语言对优化问题进行建模。

Result: 通过比较实验研究，分析了MIP、SAT和CP三种方法在性能、表达能力和可扩展性方面的表现，并确定了当前方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了将Minizinc模型整合到完整的可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的展望，以应对医学智能系统（MIS）中的高风险问题。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个利用LLMs的多智能体框架，通过SEARCH和GENERATE两阶段解决流行路径查询问题，实验证明其准确性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法在流行路径查询中需要模型训练和参数调整，而LLMs在空间和图推理方面的能力为地理空间问题提供了新的解决思路。

Method: CompassLLM采用多智能体框架，分为SEARCH阶段（识别流行路径）和GENERATE阶段（合成新路径）。

Result: 实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段具有高准确性，在GENERATE阶段表现竞争力且成本效益显著。

Conclusion: CompassLLM框架通过两阶段流程（SEARCH和GENERATE）有效解决了流行路径查询问题，展示了在准确性和成本效益上的优势。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Motivation: 多智能体辩论中存在的身份驱动谄媚和自我偏置问题影响了辩论的可靠性，需要一种方法来量化和减轻这些偏置。

Method: 提出了一种身份加权的贝叶斯更新过程，并实施了响应匿名化策略，通过移除身份标记来减少偏置。

Result: 实证研究表明身份偏置普遍存在，谄媚现象比自我偏置更为常见。匿名化策略有效减少了偏置。

Conclusion: 通过匿名化响应和定义身份偏置系数（IBC），本研究成功减少了多智能体辩论中的身份偏置，提高了辩论的可靠性。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

Motivation: 多智能体系统在LLM基础上常因边缘级错误级联而表现不佳，需一种轻量级方法抑制错误传播。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 从故障轨迹中提取边缘级判断；2) 监督策略以决定提问的时机、内容、对象和方式；3) 使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性，且额外开销极低（延迟和成本均低于5%）。

Conclusion: AgentAsk通过轻量级、即插即用的澄清模块有效抑制了多智能体系统中的错误传播，显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持了低开销。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,

has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental

Conclusion: 通过引入组匹配分数和测试时间匹配（TTM）算法，研究揭示了前沿AI模型在组合推理中的隐藏能力，并显著提升了模型性能，甚至在部分基准上超越了人类表现。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于离策略学习（OPL）的方法在新动作存在时可能不安全，因此需要开发一个既能保证安全又能探索新动作的框架。

Method: 首先开发了Safe OPG（安全离策略策略梯度），这是一种基于高置信度离策略评估的无模型安全OPL方法。随后提出了一种新框架，结合安全边际和逐步放松的安全正则化。

Result: 实验表明，Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全需求，但过于保守。新框架在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化，成功平衡了安全性与新动作探索。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个名为"部署高效策略学习安全用户探索"的新框架，该框架利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐渐放松安全正则化，从而在保证安全的前提下探索新动作。

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Method: 研究引入了一个可重复的仿真框架，通过三个维度评估代理：安全性改进、不安全活动检测和社交动态。代理配备了分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知，并使用SocialMetrics套件量化行为。

Result: 实验显示代理在直接多模态矛盾检测中表现尚可，但在全局安全与局部修订的协调上仅55%成功率。不同模型在安全转换率上表现差异显著（20%-98%），且45%的不安全行为在误导性视觉下被接受。

Conclusion: 研究发现当前生成代理在多模态环境中的安全性和信任度存在显著局限，特别是在全局安全与局部修订的协调上表现不足。研究提供了一个可重复的仿真平台，用于评估和改善多模态安全、一致性和社交动态。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于STL在线因果监控的奖励生成方法，用于深度强化学习，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实时和安全关键的网络物理系统中，控制合成必须保证生成的策略在不确定和动态条件下满足严格的时序和正确性要求。然而，现有的基于STL的奖励函数仅提供全局评估，可能导致训练不收敛和不稳定。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Motivation: 有机反应机理是理解化学反应性和设计新分子及反应的基础，但大型语言模型（LLMs）在化学任务中的理解能力是否反映真正的化学推理能力尚不明确。

Method: 引入了oMeBench，首个大规模、专家策划的有机机理推理基准，包含超过10,000个注释的机理步骤。提出了oMeS，一个结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性的动态评估框架。

Result: 当前模型在多步推理中表现不佳，但通过提示策略和微调专家模型可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 尽管当前模型展现出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面仍存在困难。通过提示策略和微调专家模型，性能可提升50%。oMeBench有望为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法直接总结论文内容，忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的调查缺乏连贯的分类和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，利用层次引用图（分为基础、发展和前沿三层）捕捉研究进展的结构和上下文关系，并通过多代理验证确保一致性和准确性。

Result: 实验表明，SurveyG生成的调查在全面性和结构性上优于现有框架，得到人类专家和LLM评估的认可。

Conclusion: SurveyG框架通过结合层次引用图和多代理验证，显著提升了自动化生成调查论文的全面性和结构性，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

TL;DR: MMIA是一种基于LLM的架构，通过可验证的推理过程确保医学任务的可靠性，显著降低错误率和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在医学领域中的事实和逻辑错误问题，因为这一高风险领域无法容忍此类错误。

Method: MMIA通过递归分解复杂的医学任务为基于证据的原子步骤，并自动审核整个推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性。创新之处在于其“引导”模式，将验证的推理链存储为“定理”，后续任务可通过检索增强生成（RAG）高效解决。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域验证中，MMIA的错误检测率超过98%，误报率低于1%，显著优于基线LLMs。RAG匹配模式预计将平均处理成本降低约85%。

Conclusion: MMIA的验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的人工智能系统的重要一步，使LLM技术在医学关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

TL;DR: GRAIL是一种无需源数据的测试时图域适应框架，通过生成式图恢复和LLM微调，有效解决域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域适应方法依赖源域数据，但因隐私或安全问题常不可用，因此需要开发无需源数据的测试时图域适应方法。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架，包括节点表征压缩、图扩散过程建模、量化模块编码及LLM微调作为生成式恢复器，并结合强化学习优化恢复质量。

Result: 大量实验证明GRAIL在不同数据集上均有效，成功将目标图恢复至与源域对齐的状态。

Conclusion: GRAIL框架通过生成式图恢复方法，成功解决了测试时图域适应中的关键挑战，无需访问源数据，实现了目标图与源域的有效对齐。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Motivation: 现有分解方法多为启发式且依赖代理或手动分解，导致LLMs在复杂任务上可靠性不足。

Method: 提出了ACONIC框架，将任务建模为约束问题并利用形式化的复杂度度量指导分解。

Result: 在组合任务（SATBench）和LLM数据库查询任务（Spider）上，基于复杂度度量的分解使代理性能显著提升（10-40个百分点）。

Conclusion: 通过引入ACONIC框架，论文展示了系统性分解任务在提升LLMs处理复杂任务可靠性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

Motivation: 扩展较小模型的推理能力是当前研究重点，但现有方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型的响应上限完全由自身决定，无法从全对或全错样本中学习。

Method: 提出了Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)方法，利用外部标准参考答案引导模型更新方向，解决了GRPO等算法无法从全对或全错样本中学习的局限性。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上表现优异，显著优于基线模型，同时提高了训练效率和模型的泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: GCPO通过引入外部标准参考答案，显著提升了较小语言模型的推理能力和训练效率，并在多个基准数据集上取得了优于基线模型的成果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 研究在对抗环境中，追捕者如何在获取信息和暴露风险之间进行权衡。

Method: 提出了 SHADOW，一个多头部顺序强化学习框架，结合连续导航控制、离散通信行为和对手建模。

Result: SHADOW 追捕者的成功率高于六个竞争基线，且时间序列建模和对手建模对决策至关重要。

Conclusion: SHADOW 框架通过整合连续导航控制、离散通信行为和对手建模，显著提高了追捕者的成功率，并在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Method: CityNav采用分层框架，结合全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理，通过合作推理优化机制进行联合训练，采用双奖励结构（个体奖励和共享奖励）。

Conclusion: CityNav框架展示了LLM在大规模、自适应和协作式城市交通导航中的潜力，为复杂城市环境中的智能车辆路由提供了基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

Conclusion: 该论文提出了‘有意义的透明度’概念，旨在通过结合以人为中心的AI透明度和社会技术系统视角，使公众能够理解并参与影响其生活的AI决策过程。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM金融代理存在'利润幻象'，即回测表现优异但实际因信息泄漏而失效，需系统量化泄漏问题并提出解决方案。

Method: FactFin框架整合了策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件。

Result: 实验表明，FactFin在样本外泛化能力上超越所有基线，风险调整后表现更优。

Conclusion: FactFin框架通过反事实扰动有效缓解了LLM金融代理中的信息泄漏问题，显著提升了样本外泛化能力和风险调整后表现。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的AI代理在个性化交互方面存在局限，尤其是缺乏将上下文信息与用户特定数据结合的机制。

Method: 作者提出了一种框架，结合了多代理协作、多源检索、持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和不断演变的用户档案，以实现个性化的长期互动。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的评估显示，该框架在检索准确性、响应正确性和BertScore等指标上表现良好。为期五天的试点用户研究提供了关于感知个性化的初步反馈。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个结合持久记忆和动态协调的框架，通过整合用户档案和自我验证机制，显著提升了基于LLM的智能代理的个性化和长期互动能力。初步用户研究表明，该方法在感知个性化方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE框架通过结合逐步奖励策略优化（SRPO）、多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习，显著提升了电商搜索中的推理质量和相关性预测准确性，超越了现有基线方法，并增强了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有语音基准主要关注孤立能力（如转录或问答），缺乏对多语言、文化理解及对抗鲁棒性等实际代理场景的系统评估。

Method: 通过VoiceAgentBench这一综合基准进行系统评估，该基准包含超过5,500条合成语音查询，支持英语、印地语和其他5种印度语言，并采用新型采样算法最大化声学和说话人多样性。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前SpeechLMs在语境工具编排任务、印度语种泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前的大规模语音语言模型（SpeechLMs）在语境工具编排、印度语种泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著不足，暴露了其关键局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个多代理框架，通过动态信息管理和用户协作，解决了移动GUI代理在复杂任务中的信息困境，提升了任务导航的适应性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过于强调自主操作，忽视了用户在任务执行中的主动参与，导致在信息困境（如模糊、动态变化和冲突任务场景）中适应性不足，执行结果偏离用户真实需求和偏好。

Method: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多代理框架，包含三个专门代理：信息管理代理、决策代理和反思代理，围绕共享内存模块工作，实现动态信息管理和用户主动参与。

Result: 实验结果表明，ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境，生成更符合用户偏好的结果，在涉及信息困境的复杂任务中，比Mobile-Agent-v2成功率高出25%。

Conclusion: ReInAgent通过动态信息管理和持续用户-代理协作，有效解决了现有移动GUI代理在复杂任务中的信息困境，实现了更符合用户真实需求的自动化任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否将连续值作为连续空间处理，以及其数值表示的质量。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析来评估语言模型对数值的表示。

Result: 虽然数值重建具有高保真度（$R^2 \geq 0.95$），但主成分仅解释了嵌入空间中的一小部分变化，且随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差均下降。

Conclusion: 语言模型在处理数值时表现出非连续性和高噪声，这对需要高数值精度的应用领域有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

Motivation: 解决大型推理模型生成冗长推理链导致推断成本高和可用性差的问题，探索无需显式长度目标的自适应控制方法。

Method: 引入Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR)，基于推理阶段熵差异设计奖励机制，惩罚思考阶段高熵并允许答案阶段适度探索。

Result: PEAR在四个基准测试中显著减少响应长度，同时保持竞争力准确性，并表现出良好的OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR机制通过阶段依赖性熵奖励设计，有效平衡了推理长度与准确性，展示了在多种模型规模上的鲁棒性和OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

Motivation: LoRA在自注意力模块的$W^Q$和$W^V$投影矩阵上应用时，虽取得了参数效率与性能的平衡，但仍面临性能次优和收敛慢的挑战。

Method: AILoRA采用功能感知的非对称初始化策略，分别对$W^Q$和$W^V$注入主成分和次成分，以保留任务自适应能力和通用特征表示。

Result: AILoRA通过非对称初始化策略，显著提升了微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过引入功能感知的非对称低秩先验，显著提升了参数效率微调的性能和收敛效率，为大型预训练模型的下游任务适配提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

Conclusion: LinguaSim通过自然语言生成高保真、交互式的3D场景，有效提升了自动驾驶测试和训练场景的真实性和安全性。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

Conclusion: MCCS算法通过引入区域单调性非一致性评分和全局BH程序，成功实现了在多条件环境下的FDR控制，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Motivation: 在线评论的质量评估对电子商务平台和信息服务至关重要，但传统方法难以跨领域扩展且无法适应内容模式的演变，而现代深度学习方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: AutoQual框架通过模拟人类研究过程，迭代生成特征假设、自主工具实现特征操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验，实现了从数据中提取可解释特征的自动化。

Result: 在大规模在线平台上的A/B测试表明，AutoQual显著提升了用户体验，平均每位用户浏览的评论数量增加了0.79%，评论读者的转化率提高了0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual作为一种基于LLM的代理框架，成功地将隐含知识转化为可计算的显性特征，不仅提高了在线评论的质量评估效果，还提升了用户体验和商业转化率。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性，无法完全消除敏感信息及其代理的影响。论文旨在提供一种数学上可证明的公平AI方法，确保在诸如贷款审批等任务中的完全公平性。

Method: 利用OWL 2 QL中的本体工程，正式定义敏感属性并通过逻辑推理推断其代理，构建了一个捕捉偏见模式完整结构的sigma代数G。通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输生成与G独立且最小化L2距离的公平表示。

Result: 该方法生成了一种可认证且数学上严谨的公平表示，确保了AI系统的可信度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除所有敏感信息及其代理，克服了当前偏见缓解方法的限制。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively

role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PMFR提出异步知识编排框架，显著降低延迟并保持质量，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话AI系统中，全面的知识访问导致不可接受的响应延迟，现有方法要么牺牲推理深度，要么因同步执行而阻塞交互。

Method: PMFR采用三个协调组件：实时知识充足性评估器、轻量级响应生成器和异步知识精炼代理，通过智能触发机制实现异步知识编排。

Result: 在TopiOCQA上的评估显示，PMFR实现了95.3%的延迟降低（23.38秒至1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C：0.613 vs. 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架有效解决了开放域对话AI系统中的延迟-质量权衡问题，显著降低了延迟并保持了响应质量。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

TL;DR: R-HORIZON是一个新方法，用于评估和提升大型推理模型的长视野推理能力，通过构建复杂多步任务基准，发现当前模型表现不佳，但通过强化学习可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，未能充分评估模型在复杂、长视野场景中的理解和响应能力。

Method: 提出了R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激LRMs的长视野推理行为，并构建了一个长视野推理基准。

Result: 使用R-HORIZON进行强化学习（RLVR）显著提高了多视野推理任务的性能，并在标准推理任务上提升了7.5的AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON被定位为一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式，用于增强和评估大型推理模型（LRMs）的长视野推理能力。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI 系统的开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家，可能编码狭隘利益并限制公共机构。缺乏公共、可审计的多元化治理措施。

Method: AIPI 通过四个支柱（参与式治理、包容性与多样性、透明度和问责制）评估生产者和系统家族，采用可验证的实践编码，并明确处理“未知”证据。

Result: AIPI 提供了一个透明、基于证据的工具，通过结构化网络分析、外部评估和专家访谈等可复现流程，评估 AI 系统的多元化治理。

Conclusion: AI Pluralism Index (AIPI) 旨在引导激励措施向多元化实践发展，并为政策制定者、采购者和公众提供可比较的证据。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

TL;DR: 论文提出TTM方法，通过减少比较次数和确保一致性，解决了传统成对比较方法的高认知负荷和计算复杂性问题，并开发了实用工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的成对比较方法（如模糊偏好关系和Saaty的乘法偏好关系）在多准则决策中广泛应用，但存在高认知负荷、不一致性和计算复杂性的限制。

Method: TTM包括三个阶段：(i) 使用减少的有针对性的比较集来获取专家判断，(ii) 构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii) 从结果矩阵中导出全局价值尺度。该方法确保了设计上的一致性，最小化了认知努力，并将偏好建模的维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数。

Result: TTM不仅确保了设计上的一致性，还开发了一个基于网络的工具，展示了其在真实决策场景中的实际应用性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新颖的Tournament Tree Method (TTM)，通过仅需m-1次成对比较即可获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，有效解决了传统方法的高认知负荷、不一致性和计算复杂性问题。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，缺乏因果意识。通过增强AI对环境中潜在机制的因果理解，可以提升其性能。

Method: DODO算法通过Agent在隐藏因果DAG的环境中执行干预，利用因果推理技术分析观察到的变化统计显著性。

Result: DODO在大多数资源条件下优于纯观测方法，能在零误差情况下重建因果图结构，在最具挑战性配置中比最佳基线高0.25 F1分数。

Conclusion: DODO算法通过自主学习和干预，显著提高了因果图结构的推断准确性，尤其在资源充足条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Conclusion: 通过因果视角重新审视推理任务，提出了SR$^2$框架，显著提升了推理准确性，证明了其在复杂推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Motivation: 揭示基于大语言模型（LLM）的代理在安全性和鲁棒性方面的漏洞，尤其是传统后门攻击无法实现的多步控制问题。

Method: 提出了Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri)，一种针对长视野代理控制的多步后门攻击方法，通过有序触发序列实现多步操控。

Result: CoTri实现了近乎完美的攻击成功率（ASR）和接近零的误触发率（FTR），同时意外提升了代理在良性任务上的性能。

Conclusion: CoTri不仅实现了稳定的多步控制，还意外提升了代理在良性任务上的性能和鲁棒性，这使得攻击更具隐蔽性，增加了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural

Method: 通过分析八个推理模型在五个数学数据集上的表现，构建了不同反射步骤的监督微调数据集，并提出了一种问题感知的早期停止方法。

Result: 动态截断反射减少了24.5%的推理标记，同时准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种动态截断反射的方法，以减少不必要的推理步骤，同时保持较高的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Pass@k指标在大采样预算下可能误导性地反映模型的推理边界，尤其是在离散答案空间任务中，因为它更多反映了多次尝试的成功率而非真实推理能力。

Method: 提出了Cover@tau指标，用于测量模型在离散答案空间任务中的表现，该指标基于一个明确的可靠性阈值，能够有效区分推理与随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau指标评估多个RLVR模型后，发现其相对排名与Pass@1指标下的结果不同，揭示了模型推理边界的新视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau 提供了一种更可靠的评估方法，能够有效区分模型的真实推理能力与随机猜测，为RLVR模型在离散答案空间任务中的评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Result: 在包含57个人护理产品调查的广泛数据集上，SSR达到了人类测试-重测可靠性的90%，并保持了真实的响应分布（KS相似性>0.85）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的语义相似度评分（SSR）方法通过生成文本响应并映射到Likert分布，有效解决了大语言模型（LLM）直接生成数值评分时的分布不真实问题，实现了可扩展的消费者研究模拟。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Conclusion: QAgent作为一种统一的代理RAG框架，通过交互式推理和检索优化查询理解，有效提升了LLM在知识密集型任务中的表现，并实现了即插即用的实际部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量上训练视觉语言模型需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息。

Method: 我们提出了一种轻量级基于解码器的架构，包括（1）令牌级动态门控用于自适应融合语言和视觉线索，（2）特征调制和通道注意力以最大化有限视觉信息的效用，（3）辅助对比目标用于视觉接地。

Result: 在五个基准测试（BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA）上显示出与多模态基线相比具有竞争力或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的研究确立了动态门控作为一种高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

TL;DR: AutoMLGen是一个基于LLM的编码代理，通过领域知识库和MCGS在MLE任务中实现高性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器学习工程（MLE）任务中缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，且现有方法无法有效利用历史轨迹或跨分支共享信息，限制了自进化能力和搜索空间多样性。

Method: AutoMLGen结合了领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS），后者在树状探索中嵌入图结构以支持动态路径重组、历史轨迹复用和多解决方案融合。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算内（标准运行时间的一半）实现了多项指标的领先，如平均奖牌率和有效提交率。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过整合领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS），在机器学习工程（MLE）任务中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了自进化能力和搜索空间多样性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: CaRT通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练LLMs适时终止信息收集，提高了任务效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在多次交互中如何有效收集信息并适时终止以避免过度思考或偏离任务的问题。

Method: CaRT利用反事实轨迹对（一个适合终止的轨迹和一个不适终止的修改版本）进行微调，并通过语言推理训练LLMs解释终止决策的合理性。

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。

Conclusion: CaRT通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练，显著提高了LLMs在信息收集和任务决策中的效率和成功率。

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究需要广泛的思考和复杂的多步依赖推理，这对智能系统提出了重大挑战。

Method: 提出了FlowSearch，一个多智能体框架，通过动态构建和演化结构化知识流来驱动子任务执行和推理。

Result: FlowSearch在包括GAIA、HLE、GPQA和TRQA在内的通用和科学基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FlowSearch在多学科研究场景中表现出色，并具备推动科学发现的潜力。

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured
knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable
of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA,
demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and
its potential to advance scientific discovery. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决当前代理依赖专家监督微调的局限性，专家演示仅涵盖狭窄的场景范围，暴露代理于有限的环境多样性。

Method: 研究了两种策略：隐式世界建模（使用收集的状态来基于环境动态）和自我反思（代理从次优行动中学习以改进推理和决策）。

Conclusion: 早期经验作为一种中间范式，为后续强化学习提供了坚实的基础，成为模仿学习与完全经验驱动代理之间的实用桥梁。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

TL;DR: 研究如何在微调大型多模态模型时避免遗忘原有能力，提出了两种有效的调整方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何在教授大型多模态模型（LMMs）新技能的同时避免遗忘原有能力。

Method: 研究了五种目标技能的连续微调，并通过三种模型家族在八个保留基准上监控通用能力。观察到在窄微调后保留任务上的“遗忘”现象部分可恢复，并通过输出令牌分布的可测量变化来解释。

Result: 识别出两种简单、稳健的调整方法，能在学习新技能时限制性能漂移，并在模型和任务中实现目标性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过仅更新自注意力投影层或仅更新MLP Gate&Up层并冻结Down投影层，可以在保持模型原有性能的同时有效学习新技能。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at
