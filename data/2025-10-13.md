### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究比较了CNN和LLMs在文本覆盖检测中的表现，发现微调LLMs在少量数据下性能显著提升，为跨模态学习提供新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过最小监督将语言引导模型适应于精确视觉理解，以弥补LLMs在专业视觉任务中潜力未充分开发的不足。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLMs和微调多模态LLMs进行了全面比较，专注于图像中人工文本覆盖检测任务。

Result: LLMs在少于1,000张图像的微调下，性能提升高达36%，达到或超越需要更多数据的CNN基线。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLMs在有限数据下通过微调显著提升性能的潜力，为跨模态学习提供了新见解和实用指导。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

### [2] [Hierarchical Scheduling for Multi-Vector Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08976)
*Maoliang Li,Ke Li,Yaoyang Liu,Jiayu Chen,Zihao Zheng,Yinjun Wu,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMIR框架通过分层检索和自动参数配置，提升多模态检索精度并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法在多模态大语言模型应用中存在检索精度有限和效率低下的问题，尤其是查询与图像对象对齐不足及细粒度图像段冗余。

Method: 引入分层范式，利用多个中间粒度增强图像对象对齐；通过跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余匹配计算；自动配置数据集参数。

Result: HiMIR在精度上实现显著提升，同时计算量减少高达3.5倍。

Conclusion: HiMIR框架通过分层范式和自动参数配置，显著提升了检索精度并减少了计算开销，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI

three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [4] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明初始噪声样本影响记忆化逃离时间，提出调整初始噪声的策略以减少记忆化并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在训练数据记忆化和复制方面的问题，尤其是隐私和版权方面的担忧。

Method: 提出了两种缓解策略：集体或个体调整初始噪声样本，以找到并利用促进早期逃离吸引盆的初始样本。

Result: 实验表明，不同的初始噪声样本导致不同的逃离时间，调整初始噪声可以显著减少记忆化，同时保持图像与文本的对齐。

Conclusion: 通过调整初始噪声样本，可以显著减少文本到图像扩散模型中的记忆化现象，同时保持图像与文本的对齐。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [5] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现AI图像生成工具在职业场景中可能强化性别刻板印象，需采取措施提升多样性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注AI生成图像的质量和创作过程，而忽视了表现偏见问题，尤其是在职业场景中的性别偏见。

Method: 通过生成750多张职业相关AI图像，并进行主题分析，比较DALL-E 3和Ideogram的表现。

Result: 两种工具均在不同程度上强化了传统性别刻板印象。

Conclusion: AI图像生成工具（如DALL-E 3和Ideogram）在职业场景中可能强化传统性别刻板印象，需采取措施提升多样性表现。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAR通过动态混合专家路由器减少计算冗余，提升效率而不损失质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAR因重复Transformer调用导致的计算冗余问题。

Method: 在VAR中引入动态混合专家路由器，通过基于分辨率和令牌复杂度的比例感知阈值来平衡专家选择。

Result: 实现了20%的FLOPs减少、11%的推理速度提升，并保持了与密集基线相当的图像质量。

Conclusion: 动态混合专家路由器的集成使VAR在保持图像质量的同时，减少了20%的FLOPs并加快了11%的推理速度。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [7] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，显著提升性能，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法常混淆认知和偶然不确定性，导致对分布内模糊区域的误分类。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用层次贝叶斯建模对高斯混合模型（GMM）参数进行建模，从深度神经网络的特征空间中提取认知不确定性。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC增加22%，FPR95从76%降至40%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，显著优于现有的基于不确定性的方法，在SemanticKITTI数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [8] [Human-VDM: Learning Single-Image 3D Human Gaussian Splatting from Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02851)
*Zhibin Liu,Haoye Dong,Aviral Chharia,Hefeng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-VDM 是一种利用视频扩散模型和高斯泼溅技术从单张RGB图像生成高质量3D人体的新方法，解决了现有方法中视图不一致的问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张RGB图像生成逼真的3D人体是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有方法通常使用多视图扩散模型，但存在视图不一致的问题，阻碍了高质量3D人体的生成。

Method: Human-VDM 包含三个模块：视图一致的人体视频扩散模块、视频增强模块和高斯泼溅模块。首先，单张图像通过视频扩散模块生成连贯的人体视频；然后，视频增强模块通过超分辨率和视频插值提升生成视频的纹理和几何平滑度；最后，高斯泼溅模块在高分辨率且视图一致的图像指导下学习生成逼真的3D人体。

Result: 实验表明，Human-VDM 能够从单张图像生成高质量的3D人体，在生成质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Human-VDM 通过结合视频扩散模型和高斯泼溅技术，成功实现了从单张RGB图像生成高质量3D人体的目标，并在生成质量和数量上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Generating lifelike 3D humans from a single RGB image remains a challenging
task in computer vision, as it requires accurate modeling of geometry,
high-quality texture, and plausible unseen parts. Existing methods typically
use multi-view diffusion models for 3D generation, but they often face
inconsistent view issues, which hinder high-quality 3D human generation. To
address this, we propose Human-VDM, a novel method for generating 3D human from
a single RGB image using Video Diffusion Models. Human-VDM provides temporally
consistent views for 3D human generation using Gaussian Splatting. It consists
of three modules: a view-consistent human video diffusion module, a video
augmentation module, and a Gaussian Splatting module. First, a single image is
fed into a human video diffusion module to generate a coherent human video.
Next, the video augmentation module applies super-resolution and video
interpolation to enhance the textures and geometric smoothness of the generated
video. Finally, the 3D Human Gaussian Splatting module learns lifelike humans
under the guidance of these high-resolution and view-consistent images.
Experiments demonstrate that Human-VDM achieves high-quality 3D human from a
single image, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both generation quality
and quantity. Project page: https://human-vdm.github.io/Human-VDM/

### [9] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-OSCAR 是一种层次化开放集分类器，解决了 HAR 中未标注活动和类别相似性问题，实现了高精度识别和未知活动拒绝，并公开了数据集 NFI_FARED。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 HAR 中未标注活动和类别相似性问题，提升分类器的可靠性和实用性。

Method: 通过将活动类别组织成层次结构，并开发 Hi-OSCAR（一种层次化开放集分类器），实现了对已知活动的高精度识别和对未知活动的拒绝与定位。

Result: Hi-OSCAR 在已知活动识别上达到先进水平，并能有效拒绝和定位未知活动。同时，公开了新的数据集 NFI_FARED 以支持未来研究。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR 提出了一种层次化开放集分类方法，能够在保持已知活动识别准确性的同时有效拒绝未知活动，并通过层次结构提供更细粒度的分类信息。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [10] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种自动化检测高频振荡（HFOs）的新方法，通过无监督聚类技术有效区分HFOs与其他信号，验证了HFOs作为癫痫发生区生物标志物的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉识别HFOs耗时、费力且主观，因此开发自动化检测方法对研究和临床使用至关重要。

Method: 本研究开发了一种新颖的HFOs检测方法，采用无监督聚类技术对从时频域（使用S变换）提取的事件进行分类。该方法能够区分HFOs事件、尖峰、背景活动和伪影。

Result: 在受控数据集上，该方法实现了97.67%的灵敏度、98.57%的精确度和97.78%的F分数。在癫痫患者中，结果显示切除与非切除接触之间的HFOs比率与手术结果有更强的相关性（0.73）。

Conclusion: 高频振荡（HFOs）是癫痫患者中癫痫发生区的有前景的生物标志物，尤其是快速波纹。移除HFOs，尤其是快速波纹，可导致癫痫自由，而剩余的HFOs则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文通过分析DINOv2的表示结构，提出Minkowski表示假设（MRH），揭示了视觉变换器表示的组织方式，并验证了其经验特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DINOv2被广泛用于识别物体、场景和动作，但其感知的本质仍不清楚。研究旨在通过可解释性方法揭示其内部表示的结构和功能。

Method: 采用线性表示假设（LRH）并通过稀疏自编码器（SAE）操作化，构建了一个32,000单元的字典作为可解释性研究的核心。研究分为三部分：分析下游任务如何利用字典中的概念、分析SAE学习的概念的几何和统计特性、提出MRH并验证其经验特征。

Result: 研究发现表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，字典向更高一致性演化，且表示通过凸混合原型（如动物中的兔子、颜色中的棕色）组织，支持了MRH的提出。

Conclusion: 论文提出了Minkowski表示假设（MRH），为解释视觉变换器表示提供了新的视角，并探讨了其经验特征和影响。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

TL;DR: PhyDAE 是一种物理引导的退化自适应专家方法，通过显式建模退化物理和高效计算策略，显著提升遥感图像恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有全合一恢复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示且缺乏对退化物理的显式建模的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，结合 Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) 和 Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) 从流形几何和频率角度分析退化特征。

Result: 在 MD-RSID、MD-RRSHID 和 MDRS-Landsat 三个基准数据集上，PhyDAE 在四种恢复任务中均表现出色，参数数量和计算复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: PhyDAE 通过两阶段级联架构和物理感知专家模块，显著提升了遥感图像恢复的性能和效率，在多个基准数据集上全面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Method: Hulu-Med 基于统一的基于补丁的视觉编码器和LLM解码器构建，逐步训练了1670万个样本，从2D扩展到3D和视频理解。

Result: 在30个基准测试中，Hulu-Med表现出最先进的性能，超越了领先的开源模型，并在多语言和罕见病场景中的视觉问答、医学报告生成和复杂推理任务中与专有系统竞争。

Conclusion: Hulu-Med 通过开源其完整流程，证明了高性能医学视觉语言模型可以透明实现，为可访问且有影响力的临床AI提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

Conclusion: Puffin通过整合语言回归和基于扩散的生成技术，展示了在相机中心多模态任务中的卓越性能，并计划发布代码、模型和数据集以推动空间智能研究。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

TL;DR: SOR 是一种通过冻结内部网络结构并应用正则化的新框架，显著提升了少样本医学影像分类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习方法在有限数据下容易过拟合，且难以适应领域特定特征。SOR 旨在解决这些问题，提升模型在少量数据下的性能。

Method: SOR 框架通过冻结内部网络结构（如卷积滤波器）并应用组套索和 L1 惩罚，以最少的额外参数定制模型，适用于各种网络组件。

Result: 在三个少样本医学影像分类任务中，SOR 使用 DenseNet121 和 EfficientNetB4 取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: Structured Output Regularization (SOR) 是一种简单而有效的框架，通过冻结内部网络结构并使用组套索和 L1 惩罚的结合，显著提升了模型在有限数据下的适应能力，并在医学影像分类任务中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试主要关注特定领域，缺乏对MLLMs具身能力的全面系统评估。

Method: 引入BEAR基准测试，涵盖14个领域的4,469个条目，评估20个代表性MLLMs，并提出BEAR-Agent以增强MLLMs的感知和规划能力。

Result: BEAR-Agent在BEAR基准测试中实现了9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: BEAR-Agent通过整合预训练视觉模型显著提升了MLLMs在BEAR基准测试中的表现，展示了其在模拟环境中提升具身任务的潜力。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

TL;DR: 论文提出一种生物启发的防御框架，通过注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码，无需重新训练即可提升模型对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗攻击对深度学习模型的安全部署构成重大挑战，而传统防御方法通常依赖于计算密集型优化。论文假设人类视觉系统通过进化生物机制实现对对抗扰动的固有鲁棒性，因此探索了生物启发机制在提升模型鲁棒性方面的潜力。

Method: 该方法结合了三种关键生物机制：中央-外周处理、扫视眼球运动和皮层填充，采用强化学习引导的扫视来选择性捕捉多个中央-外周瞥见，并将这些瞥见整合为重建图像后进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了系统鲁棒性，适用于多种分类器和攻击类型，同时相比生物和非生物启发的防御技术显著降低了训练开销。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于生物启发机制的防御框架，通过结合注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码，有效提升了深度学习模型对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性。该方法无需重新训练或微调下游分类器，实现了与现有系统的无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

models performing faster and more robustly across different lighting
conditions. Our system runs on consumer-grade hardware (RTX 4080) and achieves
inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real

performs best.

TL;DR: LinearSR框架首次系统性解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的应用难题，通过ESGF、SNR-based MoE和TAG实现了高效且高质量的图像超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在图像超分辨率中表现强大，但自注意力的二次复杂度（O(N^2)）导致计算瓶颈。线性注意力（O(N)）虽有潜力，但此前未能在超分辨率领域实现高质量结果。

Method: 采用基于'拐点'的早期停止引导微调（ESGF）策略解决训练不稳定性问题，使用SNR-based MoE架构缓解感知-失真权衡，并引入TAG轻量级指导范式。

Result: LinearSR模型在保持高效的同时，实现了最先进的感知质量。其核心扩散前向传递（1-NFE）达到了SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了LinearSR框架，首次系统地解决了线性注意力在超分辨率领域的应用难题，并通过ESGF策略、SNR-based MoE架构和TAG指导范式，实现了高效且高质量的图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Method: Q-Router 是一个基于多级模型路由系统的代理框架，结合了多种专家模型和视觉-语言模型（VLMs），动态选择和集成最适合的专家模型来处理输入视频的语义。

Result: Q-Router 在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越了现有最先进的VQA模型，同时在泛化能力和可解释性方面有显著提升。此外，Q-Router 还能定位时空伪影，展示了其在视频生成模型后训练中的潜力。

Conclusion: Q-Router 作为一个通用的视频质量评估框架，通过多级模型路由系统，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和可解释性，并在多个基准测试中表现优异，展示了其作为下一代VQA系统的潜力。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多个Med-VQA数据集上超越了现有最佳方法，解决了模态对齐和硬负样本问题，并通过门控交叉注意力模块有效融合了相关知识。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Motivation: 现有的扩散超分辨率方法对所有像素统一处理，导致计算效率低下，限制了在高分辨率和长视频中的应用。

Method: 提出 SkipSR 框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，并跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，SkipSR 在 720p 视频上比现有模型快 60%，且无明显质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR 是一种简单有效的框架，通过跳过低细节区域的计算，显著加速了视频超分辨率处理，同时保持了感知质量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

Motivation: 图像预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理密集且时间延展的视频输入时面临感知瓶颈和令牌过载的挑战。

Method: 提出D-CoDe框架，包含动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间令牌聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询拆分为子问题）。

Result: 实验表明，D-CoDe在多类基准测试中显著提升了视频理解能力，尤其在长视频任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架通过动态压缩和问题分解有效解决了视频大语言模型（Vid-LLMs）中的感知瓶颈和令牌过载问题，显著提升了视频理解能力，并在长视频任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过标签引导的知识蒸馏，显著提升了开放词汇3D实例分割的性能和推理速度，并在ScanNet200数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: SegTrans是一种新型迁移攻击框架，通过局部语义信息优化扰动，显著提升对抗样本的迁移性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法在分割模型间的迁移性较差，主要由于复杂的上下文依赖性和特征分布差距。

Method: 提出SegTrans框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射其语义信息来生成多样化的增强样本，用于优化扰动。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes数据集上，SegTrans实现了平均8.55%的迁移攻击成功率提升，计算效率提高超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans显著提高了对抗样本在不同分割模型间的迁移成功率，且不引入额外计算开销。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

TL;DR: ASVP 是一种针对图像修复模型的运行时防御方法，通过奇异值分解注入高频扰动，有效阻止知识蒸馏攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击对深度模型知识产权构成威胁，现有防御方法在图像分类中有效，但难以扩展到图像修复任务。

Method: 提出了一种运行时防御方法 Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP)，通过奇异值分解 (SVD) 对教师模型的内部特征图进行操作，放大 topk 奇异值以注入结构化高频扰动。

Result: ASVP 在五种图像修复任务中显著降低了学生模型的性能（PSNR 降低 4 dB，SSIM 降低 60-75%），同时对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP 提供了一种实用的解决方案，有效保护开源图像修复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏攻击。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视频理解任务中表现优异，但其在面对篡改视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 引入了Ro-Bench基准，通过编辑视频的Style、Object、Background及其组合，生成高质量、多样且时序相关的反事实视频测试集，评估了8种最新的视频MLLMs。

Result: 当前模型在Ro-Bench上面对反事实视频内容时性能显著下降，但通过反事实数据微调后，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The

Motivation: 由于特定农场条件下（如不同动物品种、环境和行为）缺乏大型数据集，传统的迁移学习方法难以应对动物健康监测中的数据限制问题。

Method: 提出了一种针对动物健康监测的对象聚焦数据增强框架，包括动物分割、变换和基于扩散的合成，以创建多样化的真实场景。

Result: 初步实验表明，增强后的数据集在动物检测任务上表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成特定领域的数据，弥补了数据稀缺与实用之间的差距，即使在数据匮乏的情况下也能支持实时动物健康监测。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs在视觉感知任务中表现有限，推断时间扩展带来的改进不明显，需要新的方法来提升感知准确性。

Method: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)范式，将复杂感知问题分解为可处理的子问题，并结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS将高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%，并在域外任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PTS通过引入感知相关token和增强模型对图像token的关注，显著提升了LVLMs的感知准确性，并在推理任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: mmJoints通过增强关节描述符，提升了毫米波姿态估计的准确性和下游任务性能，错误率低至4.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射常导致模型依赖统计先验而非传感器数据推断关节位置，这在下游任务中可能降低性能。mmJoints旨在通过明确估计关节的可信度来缓解这一问题。

Method: mmJoints框架通过估计关节被感知的可能性及其预测位置的可靠性，对预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器的输出进行增强。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置中，mmJoints的关节描述符估计错误率低于4.2%，关节位置准确性提升高达12.5%，活动识别性能提升高达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过引入额外的关节描述符，显著提高了毫米波姿态估计的准确性和下游任务（如活动识别）的性能，同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于注意力机制的Transformer方法在3D手部重建中未能完全实现鲁棒和准确的性能，主要由于关节间空间关系建模效率低下。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的图引导Mamba框架（Hamba），通过图引导的双向扫描和Graph-guided State Space (GSS)块，高效学习关节间的空间关系，减少了88.5%的token使用。

Result: Hamba在FreiHAND基准测试中取得了PA-MPVPE为5.3mm和F@15mm为0.992的优异结果，并在两个竞赛排行榜上排名第一。

Conclusion: Hamba通过结合图学习和状态空间建模，显著提升了3D手部重建的性能，并在多个基准测试和实际应用中表现优异，达到了当前最先进水平。

Abstract: 3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the
articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA
methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and
shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily
due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this
problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which
bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to
reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D
reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently
learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction
performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block
that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and
uses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we
integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion
module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively
leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global
and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks
and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing
SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the
time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1 in two
Competition Leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction. Project Website:

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像（T2I）模型在复杂局部区域（如手部）的细节生成上存在不足，且手部区域的质量评估被忽视。

Method: 提出了HandEval，一个基于MLLM并结合手部关键点先验知识的手部质量评估模型。

Conclusion: HandEval显著提升了生成手部区域的真实性和AIGC检测的准确性，验证了其在下游应用中的普遍有效性。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了首个防御性范例——不可着色示例（Uncolorable Examples），通过嵌入不可感知的扰动来防止未经授权的AI着色，为生成媒体中的版权保护开辟了新方向。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Conclusion: 通过将去噪过程融入Jacobi迭代，SJD2框架成功实现了自回归模型中的并行令牌生成，显著减少了模型前向传递次数，同时保持了生成图像的视觉质量。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Motivation: LiDAR标注通常因传感器缺陷、遮挡和人为错误而存在噪声，这种噪声会降低分割精度，并在域偏移下进一步恶化，威胁系统可靠性。现有噪声标签学习方法在3D LiDAR分割中的域泛化问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 论文引入了DGLSS-NL任务，并提出了DuNe框架，该框架包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来优化模型。

Result: DuNe在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes和SemanticPOSS数据集上分别实现了56.86%、42.28%和52.58%的mIoU，整体算术平均（AM）为49.57%，调和平均（HM）为48.50%。

Conclusion: 论文提出了DuNe框架，通过双视图分支和置信度感知过滤，显著提升了LiDAR语义分割在噪声标签和域泛化条件下的性能，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Motivation: 森林管理机器人需要先进的感知能力，但现有数据集多集中于城市环境或有限物种，无法满足需求。

Method: 通过收集加拿大魁北克五个生物气候域的1476棵树木的24个物种的冠层下图像，并由林业专家进行标注，创建了SilvaScenes数据集。

Result: 树木分割的平均精度（mAP）为67.65%，而物种分类的mAP仅为35.69%，表明物种分类更具挑战性。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了森林环境中树木物种实例分割数据集的空白，为开发先进的感知系统提供了重要资源。尽管树木分割表现良好，但物种分类仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种病灶感知的后训练框架，优化了潜在扩散模型在医学图像转换中的性能，显著提升了图像质量和病灶描绘精确性，尤其在急性缺血性卒中诊断中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像转换模型在临床诊断中具有重要价值，但现有方法在保留关键像素级细节（如病灶）方面存在不足，可能影响诊断可靠性。本研究旨在解决这一问题，提升图像质量和病灶描绘的精确性。

Method: 研究提出了一种后训练框架，通过引入病灶感知的医学像素空间目标，优化潜在扩散模型（LDMs）在医学图像转换中的性能。具体评估了该框架在脑CT到MRI转换任务中的应用，尤其是在急性缺血性卒中患者的诊断中。

Result: 在817名患者的数据集上，该框架在合成DWI和ADC图像时，显著提升了整体图像质量和病灶描绘能力，优于现有图像转换模型。后训练策略易于适配预训练的LDMs，展现出广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的后训练框架，通过结合病灶感知的医学像素空间目标，显著提升了医学图像到图像转换的质量和病灶描绘的精确性，尤其在急性缺血性卒中患者的脑CT到MRI转换中表现出色。该方法不仅适用于预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDMs），还具有广泛的医学图像转换任务应用潜力。

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代 MLLMs 在具身 AI 和下游视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型中利用其广泛常识进行高级规划，但其对物理工具的真正理解程度尚未量化。

Method: 通过构建一个包含 1,000 多个图像-文本对的视觉问答（VQA）数据集，评估模型在三个难度级别上的表现：工具识别、工具理解和工具创造。

Result: 对 32 个 MLLMs 的全面评估显示，它们在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: PhysToolBench 揭示了当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在物理工具理解上的显著不足，并提出了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 现有的多模态信息融合方法通常显式结合多模态信息，而本文旨在探索一种不同的框架，将多模态知识嵌入到单模态网络中，以提升单模态网络的性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为'时空语义对齐'损失（SSA）的方法，通过特征对齐和'焦点正则化参数'来避免负知识转移，使不同网络的单模态网络能够协作学习共同语义和更好的表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架显著提升了单模态网络的测试准确率，并在多个动态手势识别数据集上取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架通过嵌入多模态知识到单模态网络中，显著提升了动态手势识别的测试准确率，并在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse

of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 现有法线估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面表现不足，而Mamba等状态空间模型在点云处理中的应用主要关注全局形状，忽略了局部细节。

Method: 提出了Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF)方案和Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM)，分别用于多尺度点云特征融合和局部几何建模。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过AHFF方案和PSSM模型，显著提升了点云法线估计的准确性和鲁棒性，尤其在捕捉局部几何细节方面表现出色。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Conclusion: 本文提出的GL-DT框架和JPTrack算法显著提升了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性，同时保持了实时性能，为无人机检测与跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

Motivation: 解决现有参数压缩方法（如剪枝）因模型容量减少而导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒指标的专家初始化、负载平衡的知识蒸馏以及用于MoB优化的组特征损失。

Result: 将大型扩散变换器（如FLUX.1 [dev]）转换为MoE结构，激活参数减少60%，性能与原始模型相当，优于剪枝方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE提出了一种新的高效文本到图像生成范式，通过将密集DiT转换为MoE结构，显著减少了激活参数数量，同时保持了原始性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical

Result: 在LVIS检测任务上AP提升10.9，在gRefCOCO基础任务上N_Acc提升8.4，且在低数据量和封闭词汇场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: SOS数据合成管道通过高质量的合成对象片段和结构化布局先验，显著提升了检测和视觉基础任务的性能，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Motivation: 传统正交矩图像表示方法（如Zernike和伪Zernike矩）在高阶时存在计算复杂度高和数值不稳定的问题，亟需一种高效且稳定的替代方案。

Method: PSepT通过张量积构造离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角基，实现了极坐标中的完全核分解，从而支持独立的径向和角向处理。

Result: 实验结果表明，PSepT在数值稳定性、计算效率和分类性能上表现优异，同时支持精确重建。计算复杂度降至O(N^2 log N)，内存需求降至O(N^2)，条件数缩放降至O(√N)。

Conclusion: PSepT（极坐标可分离变换）通过其可分离设计，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求，同时保持了正交性、完整性和能量守恒等特性，为高阶矩分析提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

*Clara Tomasini,Luis Riazuelo,Ana C. Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需CT扫描的支气管镜拓扑定位方法，训练成本低且泛化能力强，效果优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于支气管树的复杂结构和医生经验的不同，支气管镜导航具有挑战性。现有方法依赖CT扫描和额外传感器，成本高且复杂。

Method: 通过仅在幻影数据上训练的方法，避免了真实数据标注的高成本，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Result: 该方法在真实数据测试序列上的表现超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位流程，无需患者CT扫描即可提供导航辅助，且在真实数据测试序列上表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需真实图像的合成数据生成方法，显著提升了实例级识别的跨领域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别（ILR）的细粒度特性使得大规模标注数据集的创建具有挑战性，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过合成生成多样化的对象实例，覆盖多个领域和不同条件与背景，构建大规模训练集。

Result: 在七个跨领域的ILR基准测试中，基于合成数据的微调显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种合成多样性对象实例的新方法，无需依赖真实图像，显著提高了跨多个领域的实例级识别性能，为数据收集和整理提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一种新颖的检测框架，不仅识别未知物体，还将它们分类到语义层次结构中的粗父类别，提升安全关键场景的决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代物体检测器受限于“封闭世界”假设，无法有效处理现实场景中的未知物体。虽然开放集检测方法试图通过将未知实例标记为“未知”来解决这一问题，但这通常不足以为安全关键决策提供足够信息。

Method: TARO采用了一种独特的架构，包括基于sparsemax的头部建模对象性、层次引导的重新标记组件提供辅助监督，以及学习层次关系的分类模块。

Result: 实验表明，TARO能够将多达29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗类别中，显著减少未知与已知类别之间的混淆，并在未知召回率和已知mAP上达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: TARO框架通过将未知物体分类到语义层次结构中的粗父类别，显著提升了自动驾驶等安全关键场景中的决策能力。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Video Depth Anything（VDA）依赖批处理而无法在在线设置中使用的问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的技术，包括在推理过程中缓存潜在特征和在训练时掩码帧。

Result: oVDA在NVIDIA A100上以42 FPS运行，在NVIDIA Jetson边缘设备上以20 FPS运行，优于所有竞争方法。

Conclusion: oVDA方法在在线视频深度估计中表现出色，特别是在准确性和VRAM使用方面，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一种多模态深度学习框架，通过改进视频特征识别和域适应策略，在牛只行为识别任务中实现高准确性和泛化能力，尤其适用于数据稀缺场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是健康和生产力的关键指标，视频监控结合深度学习已成为主流方法，但现有模型在真实场景中的域适应性和数据稀缺行为识别能力不足。

Method: 基于大规模图像-语言模型CLIP，通过添加时间整合模块、定制数据增强策略和专业化文本提示，构建了Cattle-CLIP框架，并在完全监督和少样本学习场景下进行评估。

Result: Cattle-CLIP在监督设置下对六种行为的总体准确率达96.1%，其中进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%，在少样本场景中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Cattle-CLIP通过多模态深度学习框架显著提升了牛只行为识别的准确性和泛化能力，尤其在数据稀缺情境下表现优异，展示了多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

TL;DR: 提出时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，通过时空注意力设计提升光子效率成像的3D重建性能，实验验证其优越性并贡献新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对光子效率成像中由于传感器量子效率低和噪声水平高导致的3D重建挑战，提出了一种新的解决方案。

Method: TRT架构包含两种精心设计的注意力机制：时空自注意力编码器和时空交叉注意力解码器，分别用于探索瞬态数据的局部与全局相关性，并整合这些特征。

Result: TRT的两个具体实现（TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS）在合成数据和真实数据上均显著优于现有方法，并贡献了大规模合成LOS数据集和真实NLOS测量数据。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，显著提升了光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，并通过实验验证了其在LOS和NLOS成像任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVI通过错误回收微调技术生成无限长视频，解决了现有方法误差累积和场景单一的问题，表现优异且兼容多样条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法难以避免误差累积，且仅限于单提示外推，导致场景单一和动作重复。SVI旨在解决这一根本挑战，即训练假设（基于干净数据）与自回归测试现实（基于自生成、易出错输出）之间的差异。

Method: SVI采用Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning技术，通过回收Diffusion Transformer（DiT）自生成的错误并将其转化为监督提示，从而鼓励DiT主动识别和纠正自身错误。具体包括错误注入、收集和存储的闭环回收过程，以及通过一步双向积分高效近似预测和计算残差错误。

Result: SVI能够在没有额外推理成本的情况下，将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，并与多种条件（如音频、骨架和文本流）兼容。在三个基准测试中，SVI展现了其多功能性和最先进的表现。

Conclusion: SVI通过Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning技术，能够生成无限长度的视频，同时保持时间一致性和多样化的场景转换，且在多种条件下表现优异，验证了其先进性和多功能性。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

Motivation: 现代消费电子和电商平台中，用户与多样化服务（如书籍、电影、在线零售产品）互动，需要准确捕捉领域特定和跨领域行为模式，以提供个性化且无缝的消费体验。

Method: TEMA-LLM利用LLMs生成语义标签，并将标签嵌入与项目标识符、文本和视觉特征融合，构建增强的项目表示。随后引入标签增强的多注意力机制，联合建模领域内和跨领域的用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的广泛实验表明，TEMA-LLM始终优于现有最先进的基线方法，验证了LLM基于语义标签和多注意力集成的优势。

Conclusion: TEMA-LLM框架通过结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和标签增强的多注意力机制，显著提升了跨领域序列推荐的性能，展示了LLMs在智能、用户中心服务中的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Motivation: 针对医疗资源稀缺地区早期和准确诊断肩关节疾病的挑战，研究旨在开发低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断解决方案。

Method: 研究提出了一种混合运动视频诊断框架（HMVDx），将动作理解和疾病诊断两个任务分别交由两个MLLMs完成，并引入了新的评估指标Usability Index。

Result: 实验结果显示，HMVDx框架在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入HMVDx框架，显著提高了肩关节损伤诊断的准确性，为MLLMs在医疗视频理解领域的应用提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

TL;DR: DSE能有效过滤高幻觉风险问题，显著提升VLMs在放射学VQA中的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定DSE能否通过拒绝可能产生幻觉的问题来提高黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像视觉问答中的准确性。

Method: 研究使用两个公开数据集评估DSE，通过GPT-4o和GPT-4.1多次回答问题并计算DSE，过滤高熵问题后重新计算准确率。

Result: 过滤高熵问题后，GPT-4o的准确率从51.7%提高到76.3%，GPT-4.1从54.8%提高到63.8%。

Conclusion: DSE通过量化语义不一致性，能够可靠地检测黑盒VLMs中的幻觉，显著提高了诊断答案的准确性，并为临床VLM应用提供了一种过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法采样策略通常依赖手工启发式或外部关键帧模型，前者忽略关键时间线索，后者增加系统复杂性。

Method: 1. 提出TSG新范式，使用专用的[FIND]令牌通过时间令牌相似性匹配识别关键时刻；2. 设计MCS策略，密集采样信息丰富的时刻，稀疏采样非关键帧；3. 开发BAP技术，利用最相关时刻作为高质量掩码初始化起点，并动态更新以减少误差累积。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个统一框架，联合优化时间句子定位（TSG）和参考视频对象分割（RefVOS），通过引入TSG新范式和Moment-Centric Sampling（MCS）策略，以及Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation（BAP）技术，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Result: 在八个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO显著优于领先的开源RL调优模型，其有效性在7B和32B模型规模上均得到验证。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入视觉感知的令牌视角，提出了VPPO算法，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力，为多模态RLVR的分析和优化提供了新视角和有效策略。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类视觉注视的时空统计特性在注意力建模和基于视觉的界面中有广泛应用。

Method: 进行了大规模人类受试者实验，涉及40名参与者在非约束条件下观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万个注视点。此外，训练了一个卷积神经网络（CNN）来仅从图像输入预测注视热点图。

Result: 数据显示人类眼的注视轨迹遵循类似于动物觅食的Levy walk模式。CNN模型能够准确预测新图像的显著注视区域。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循类似于自然觅食的统计规律，这为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: CapGeo通过caption辅助显著提升MLLMs的几何推理能力，并引入CapGeo-Bench作为评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLMs在几何推理上表现不佳，尤其是在理解几何图表方面，而将视觉内容转换为文本可以解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 引入CapGeo，一种基于caption辅助的推理框架，通过将视觉内容转换为文本来桥接视觉和文本模态。

Result: 实验显示，使用caption后，Qwen2.5-VL-72B和Claude-Opus-4的性能分别从8.6%提升至59.0%和44.8%提升至73.0%。

Conclusion: CapGeo框架和CapGeo-Bench基准为提升MLLMs在几何推理能力方面提供了新途径，显著提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足导致性能受限，需要一种能够充分提取上下文信息的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种粗到细的渐进学习框架：1) 通过CLIP和DINO提取多粒度特征，并在对比语言指导下进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 结合相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐细化深度预测。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，Hybrid-depth在所有指标上显著优于现有方法，并有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: Hybrid-depth框架通过整合CLIP和DINO的视觉先验，显著提升了自监督单目深度估计的性能，并在KITTI基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Conclusion: IRCR-Net显著提升了半监督核实例分割的性能，并在某些场景下甚至超越了全监督方法。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Motivation: 现有红外图像增强方法难以处理耦合退化，且通用增强方法因成像模型差异效果有限。

Method: 提出了渐进式提示融合网络（PPFN）和选择性渐进训练（SPT）机制，通过提示对调制模型特征，逐步优化复合退化处理。

Result: 实验表明方法在特定和复杂退化场景下均表现优异，性能提升8.76%。

Conclusion: PPFN和SPT机制显著提升了热红外图像在多退化条件下的增强效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉语言模型（VLMs）并采用动态CoT策略，本研究显著提升了多模态关键短语预测（MMKP）任务的性能，解决了传统方法在缺失和未见场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

Method: BLINK-Twice集成了七种视觉挑战、自然对抗图像对和标注的推理链，用于评估模型的视觉推理能力。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成显著挑战，现有语言空间的推理策略（如思维链或自我批评）虽能提升性能，但常导致不稳定和冗余的推理。

Conclusion: BLINK-Twice数据集为视觉推理提供了一个具有挑战性的基准，突显了当前MLLMs在视觉推理方面的不足，并提出了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS的性能高度依赖于初始点云质量，在无边界、动态城市场景中，部分初始化的点云会导致失真和伪影。现有方法无法重建缺失结构。

Method: 通过基于体素的可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构，采用多样性感知视图选择支持信息视图，并通过基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，VAD-GS优于现有3DGS方法，显著提升了重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS显著提升了在复杂城市场景中重建几何结构的质量，适用于静态和动态对象。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

### [81] [Utilizing dynamic sparsity on pretrained DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09380)
*Reza Sedghi,Anand Subramoney,David Kappel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了DETR中MLP层的稀疏性，提出了SIBS和MGS两种方法，MGS尤其有效，能在保持性能的同时大幅减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于变换器的模型在视觉任务（如目标检测）中的高效推理仍是一个挑战，尤其是在DETR的MLP层中存在固有的稀疏性。

Method: 我们提出了两种方法：静态基于指示器的稀疏化（SIBS）和微门控稀疏化（MGS）。SIBS是一种启发式方法，基于固定的激活模式预测神经元不活跃性；MGS则是一种轻量级门控机制，通过小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS能够保持甚至提升性能，同时显著减少计算量，实现高达85%至95%的激活稀疏性。

Conclusion: 我们的方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方案，使得预训练的视觉变换器能够在无需完全模型重训练的情况下高效部署。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

TL;DR: Mono4DEditor是一个用于文本驱动4D场景编辑的新框架，通过结合3D高斯和CLIP特征实现语义查询，采用两阶段定位策略提高准确性，并利用扩散模型进行编辑，实现了高质量的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频重建的4D场景基于文本提示进行编辑是一个有价值但具有挑战性的任务，关键难点在于在复杂动态场景的局部区域实现语义精确的编辑，同时保持未编辑内容的完整性。

Method: 该方法通过将3D高斯与量化的CLIP特征结合形成语言嵌入的动态表示，并采用两阶段点级定位策略，先通过CLIP相似性选择候选高斯，再细化其空间范围以提高准确性。最后，使用基于扩散的视频编辑模型对定位区域进行针对性编辑，利用流和涂鸦引导确保空间保真度和时间一致性。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，Mono4DEditor能够在多样化的场景和对象类型中实现高质量的文本驱动编辑，同时保持未编辑区域的外观和几何完整性。

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor 在多样化的场景和对象类型中实现了高质量的文本驱动编辑，同时保持了未编辑区域的外观和几何完整性，并在灵活性和视觉保真度上超越了先前的方法。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Motivation: 低光视频增强面临噪声、低对比度和颜色退化等问题，现有方法在利用时间信息方面存在局限，DWTA-Net旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DWTA-Net采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用Visual State-Space块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构；第二阶段引入动态权重的时间聚合模块，通过光流引导自适应平衡静态和动态区域。

Result: 实验表明，DWTA-Net能够有效抑制噪声和伪影，提供优于现有方法的视觉质量。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过两阶段框架有效利用短长期时间信息，显著提升了低光视频增强的质量，抑制了噪声和伪影，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well

Result: 研究发现某些三星设备存在共享的伪影模式，导致指纹冲突；支持PRO模式的设备通过原始图像捕获可避免伪影；伪影在HDR和肖像模式图像中有特定应用价值。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管某些三星智能手机存在对角线伪影问题，但支持PRO模式和原始图像捕获的设备仍可进行可靠的PRNU验证。此外，这些伪影在法医应用中具有潜在用途，如减少HDR图像中的误检测和定位肖像模式图像中受合成虚化影响的区域。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临的延迟和内存使用问题，避免二次计算成本和长视频性能下降。

Method: 提出StreamingVLM模型，采用紧凑的KV缓存机制，结合注意力sink、近期视觉令牌和近期文本令牌的长短窗口，并通过监督微调策略模拟推理时的注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM以66.18%的胜率优于GPT-4O mini，并在单张NVIDIA H100上保持8 FPS的实时性能。通用VQA能力在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM通过统一的框架和简单的监督微调策略，实现了对无限视觉输入的实时稳定理解，同时在长视频理解任务中表现出色，且无需特定于VQA的微调即可提升通用VQA能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Motivation: 解决小目标检测中因像素表示有限导致的信息退化问题，现有FPN方法重建的细节常偏离原始信息，影响语义融合。

Method: 提出了PRNet框架，包含渐进式细化颈部（PRN）和增强切片采样（ESSamp）模块，用于空间-语义对齐和浅层信息保留。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上，PRNet在计算约束下优于现有方法，实现了更高的精度-效率平衡。

Conclusion: PRNet通过渐进式细化颈部和增强切片采样模块，有效提升了小目标检测的精度和效率，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Motivation: 传统多层感知机（MLPs）作为隐式神经表示（INRs）在形变建模中依赖昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且特征对齐效果不佳。

Method: 提出FLOWING（FLOW morphING）框架，将变形建模为微分向量流的构造，直接在网络架构中编码结构流特性。

Result: 实验表明，FLOWING在多种应用中（如人脸、图像形变及高斯泼溅形变）实现了最先进的形变质量，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: FLOWING框架通过将变形重新构造为微分向量流，实现了连贯、可逆且时间一致的变形，显著提升了2D图像和3D形状的形变质量。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

Motivation: 现有可控扩散模型通常依赖固定架构，无法适应生成过程中从粗到细的动态需求。

Method: 采用超网络实时生成 LoRA 适配器，根据时间和用户条件动态调整冻结主干的权重。

Result: 实验表明，TC-LoRA 在生成忠实度和空间条件遵循上优于静态激活调整方法。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA 提出了一种动态权重调整的新范式，通过直接调整模型权重来适应生成过程的不同阶段，显著提升了生成质量和条件遵循能力。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Motivation: To provide a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends in computer vision and machine learning, enabling auditing and extension.

Method: Titles and abstracts of 26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS (2023-2025) were normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign topical labels and mine fine-grained cues.

Result: Quantified three macro shifts: (1) rise of multimodal VLMs, (2) expansion of generative methods, (3) resilient 3D/video activity. Also identified dominant adaptation methods and training practice shifts. Cross-venue comparisons revealed distinct thematic footprints.

Conclusion: The study highlights three major shifts in research trends: the rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, the expansion of generative methods, and resilient 3D and video activity. It also notes the dominance of parameter-efficient adaptation and changes in training practices. The analysis is consistent across venues and years, though limited by lexicon recall and abstract-only scope.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识蒸馏的框架，低成本赋予VLM动作执行能力，显著提升性能并降低训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLA模型通过整合动作模块展现了良好的泛化能力，但从零开始训练成本高昂。因此，我们提出了一种蒸馏框架，以低成本赋予VLM动作执行能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先进行轻量级对齐，将VLM隐藏状态映射到小型动作模型的动作空间；随后选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。

Result: 在LIBERO和LIBERO-LONG数据集上分别实现了97.3%和93.5%的平均成功率，显著优于先前方法。真实世界实验中，成功率提升17%。

Conclusion: 通过知识蒸馏框架，我们成功地将预训练的小型动作模型的知识迁移到VLM中，显著提高了动作生成的精确性，同时大幅降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的ABGS框架基于GCN，显著提高了背景网格的简化效率，同时保持了几何保真度和尺寸场精度。

Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for
controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation.
However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming,
computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a
significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid
simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem
and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates.
The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both
geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach
replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification
process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense
grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%,
leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross
modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage
overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework
for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by
textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based
on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape
features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with
parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a
corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original
surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of
parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer
Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369,

Conclusion: 该课程旨在通过MCMC方法作为桥梁，连接生成模型与基于物理的渲染，为学生、研究人员和从业者提供理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in
vision language models over the past two years. During the generative process,
new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional
distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly
effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions.
This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring
accurate sample generation.
  Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The
update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update
depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter
space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based
optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important
role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise
quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.
  A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples
(images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven
manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still
missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of
these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge,
linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide
necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and
practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

Result: 结果表明，该方法在渲染（半）透明动态线集时，在质量和性能上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种高效的体素化光线追踪框架，能够实时渲染大规模动态线集，并在质量和性能上优于现有技术。

Abstract: Real-time rendering of dynamic line sets is relevant in many visualization
tasks, including unsteady flow visualization and interactive white matter
reconstruction from Magnetic Resonance Imaging. High-quality global
illumination and transparency are important for conveying the spatial structure
of dense line sets, yet remain difficult to achieve at interactive rates. We
propose an efficient voxel-based ray-tracing framework for rendering large
dynamic line sets with ambient occlusion and ground-truth transparency. The
framework introduces a voxelization algorithm that supports efficient
construction of acceleration structures for both voxel cone tracing and ray
tracing. To further reduce per-frame preprocessing cost, we developed a
voxel-based culling method that restricts acceleration structure construction
to camera-visible voxels. Together, these contributions enable high-quality,
real-time rendering of large-scale dynamic line sets with physically accurate
transparency. The results show that our method outperforms the state of the art
in quality and performance when rendering (semi-)opaque dynamic line sets.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的两阶段高斯泼溅框架通过显式分离和优化近景与远景区域，显著提高了户外场景重建的保真度，并开启了新的光真实感户外渲染和混合现实应用的可能性。

Abstract: Outdoor scene reconstruction remains challenging due to the stark contrast
between well-textured, nearby regions and distant backgrounds dominated by low
detail, uneven illumination, and sky effects. We introduce a two-stage Gaussian
Splatting framework that explicitly separates and optimizes these regions,
yielding higher-fidelity novel view synthesis. In stage one, background
primitives are initialized within a spherical shell and optimized using a loss
that combines a background-only photometric term with two geometric
regularizers: one constraining Gaussians to remain inside the shell, and
another aligning them with local tangential planes. In stage two, foreground
Gaussians are initialized from a Structure-from-Motion reconstruction, added
and refined using the standard rendering loss, while the background set remains
fixed but contributes to the final image formation. Experiments on diverse
outdoor datasets show that our method reduces background artifacts and improves
perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the
explicit background separation enables automatic, object-free environment map
estimation, opening new possibilities for photorealistic outdoor rendering and
mixed-reality applications.

Motivation: 在复杂环境中，多机器人协作运输大物体需要高效的接触点选择策略。传统解析方法因解空间组合爆炸而难以扩展，而人类依赖常识推理的能力启发了结合LLM和局部搜索的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种LLM引导的局部搜索方法（ConPoSe），用于选择机器人-物体接触点，以支持多机器人协作推动物体沿预定路径移动。

Result: ConPoSe在多种形状（如长方体、圆柱体、T形物体）上成功选择了接触点，且在机器人数量和物体尺寸增加时，扩展性优于解析方法，性能也超过纯LLM方法。

Conclusion: ConPoSe方法通过结合大型语言模型的推理能力和局部搜索，成功解决了多机器人协作物体运输中的接触点选择问题，展现出比纯解析方法和纯LLM方法更好的扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Object transportation in cluttered environments is a fundamental task in
various domains, including domestic service and warehouse logistics. In
cooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects
that are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which
only requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact
points is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this
selection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially
with the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by
how humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose
combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search
to select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for
contact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a
variety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate
that ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the
analytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection.

Abstract: Operating high degree of freedom robots can be difficult for users of
wheelchair mounted robotic manipulators. Mode switching in Cartesian space has
several drawbacks such as unintuitive control reference frames, separate
translation and orientation control, and limited movement capabilities that
hinder performance. We propose Point and Go mode switching, which reallocates
the Cartesian mode switching reference frames into a more intuitive action
space comprised of new translation and rotation modes. We use a novel sweeping
motion to point the gripper, which defines the new translation axis along the
robot base frame's horizontal plane. This creates an intuitive `point and go'
translation mode that allows the user to easily perform complex, human-like
movements without switching control modes. The system's rotation mode combines
position control with a refined end-effector oriented frame that provides
precise and consistent robot actions in various end-effector poses. We verified
its effectiveness through initial experiments, followed by a three-task user
study that compared our method to Cartesian mode switching and a state of the
art learning method. Results show that Point and Go mode switching reduced
completion times by 31\%, pauses by 41\%, and mode switches by 33\%, while
receiving significantly favorable responses in user surveys.

Abstract: Developing table tennis robots that mirror human speed, accuracy, and ability
to predict and respond to the full range of ball spins remains a significant
challenge for legged robots. To demonstrate these capabilities we present a
system to play dynamic table tennis for quadrupedal robots that integrates high
speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Our system uses
external cameras for high-speed ball localization, physical models with learned
residuals to infer spin and predict trajectories, and a novel model predictive
control (MPC) formulation for agile full-body control. Notably, a continuous
set of stroke strategies emerge automatically from different ball return
objectives using this control paradigm. We demonstrate our system in the real
world on a Spot quadruped, evaluate accuracy of each system component, and
exhibit coordination through the system's ability to aim and return balls with
varying spin types. As a further demonstration, the system is able to rally
with human players.

Conclusion: GPI 提出了一种高效、可解释且可扩展的机器人模仿学习替代方案，相比基于扩散的策略，GPI 实现了更高的成功率，运行速度快20倍，内存需求更低，且对扰动保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a Geometry-aware Policy Imitation (GPI) approach that rethinks
imitation learning by treating demonstrations as geometric curves rather than
collections of state-action samples. From these curves, GPI derives distance
fields that give rise to two complementary control primitives: a progression
flow that advances along expert trajectories and an attraction flow that
corrects deviations. Their combination defines a controllable, non-parametric
vector field that directly guides robot behavior. This formulation decouples
metric learning from policy synthesis, enabling modular adaptation across
low-dimensional robot states and high-dimensional perceptual inputs. GPI
naturally supports multimodality by preserving distinct demonstrations as
separate models and allows efficient composition of new demonstrations through
simple additions to the distance field. We evaluate GPI in simulation and on
real robots across diverse tasks. Experiments show that GPI achieves higher
success rates than diffusion-based policies while running 20 times faster,
requiring less memory, and remaining robust to perturbations. These results
establish GPI as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
generative approaches for robotic imitation learning. Project website:

Abstract: From loco-motion to dextrous manipulation, humanoid robots have made
remarkable strides in demonstrating complex full-body capabilities. However,
the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on
stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either
confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking
human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few
standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on
humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and
diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety
involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction,
locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient
human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates
high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile
inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k
trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad
categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy
learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and
limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we
introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to
seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive
performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy
learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend
to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the
groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world
scenarios. Our dataset, data collection code, and cloud evaluation website are

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) requires robots to adapt their motions to
human intent to ensure safe and efficient cooperation in shared spaces.
Although large language models (LLMs) provide high-level reasoning for
inferring human intent, their application to reliable motion planning in HRC
remains challenging. Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is intuitive but
often relies on continuous kinesthetic guidance, which imposes burdens on
operators. To address these challenges, a contact-informed adaptive
motion-planning framework is introduced to infer human intent directly from
physical contact and employ the inferred intent for online motion correction in
HRC. First, an optimization-based force estimation method is proposed to infer
human-intended contact forces and locations from joint torque measurements and
a robot dynamics model, thereby reducing cost and installation complexity while
enabling whole-body sensitivity. Then, a torque-based contact detection
mechanism with link-level localization is introduced to reduce the optimization
search space and to enable real-time estimation. Subsequently, a
contact-informed adaptive motion planner is developed to infer human intent
from contacts and to replan robot motion online, while maintaining smoothness
and adapting to human corrections. Finally, experiments on a 7-DOF manipulator
are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed force estimation
method and the effectiveness of the contact-informed adaptive motion planner
under perception uncertainty in HRC.

dependencies among measurements and improves the interpretability and
computational tractability of science data. Instrument operation policies are
computed offline, allowing resource-aware plans to be generated and thoroughly
validated prior to launch. We use the Enceladus Orbilander's proposed Life
Detection Suite (LDS) as a case study, demonstrating how Bayesian network
structure and reward shaping influence system performance. We compare our
method against the mission's baseline Concept of Operations (ConOps),
evaluating both misclassification rates and performance in off-nominal sample
accumulation scenarios. Our approach reduces sample identification errors by
nearly 40%

Conclusion: CDE通过利用预训练的视觉语言模型生成对象中心视觉概念，并通过辅助目标训练策略重构这些概念，有效解决了视觉强化学习中的探索效率问题。该方法在模拟和实际机器人操作任务中均表现出色，成功率达到80%。

Abstract: Intelligent exploration remains a critical challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL), especially in visual control tasks. Unlike low-dimensional
state-based RL, visual RL must extract task-relevant structure from raw pixels,
making exploration inefficient. We propose Concept-Driven Exploration (CDE),
which leverages a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to generate
object-centric visual concepts from textual task descriptions as weak,
potentially noisy supervisory signals. Rather than directly conditioning on
these noisy signals, CDE trains a policy to reconstruct the concepts via an
auxiliary objective, using reconstruction accuracy as an intrinsic reward to
guide exploration toward task-relevant objects. Because the policy internalizes
these concepts, VLM queries are only needed during training, reducing
dependence on external models during deployment. Across five challenging
simulated visual manipulation tasks, CDE achieves efficient, targeted
exploration and remains robust to noisy VLM predictions. Finally, we
demonstrate real-world transfer by deploying CDE on a Franka Research 3 arm,
attaining an 80\% success rate in a real-world manipulation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNSS辅助方法依赖定位结果或未解决模糊度的原始测量，且其可观测性研究不足，因此需要一种更精确的校准方法。

Method: 通过扩展因子图优化（FGO）框架，融合IMU、里程计和原始GNSS测量（伪距、载波相位和多普勒），并引入异常值抑制和模糊度解决。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在校准和定位性能上优于现有松耦合方法，IMU-odometer定位的最大绝对误差从61.51米降至17.75米。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种紧密耦合的在线校准方法，显著提高了IMU-odometer定位的精度，最大绝对误差降低了71.14%。此外，还发布了首个结合IMU、2D里程计和原始GNSS测量的开源数据集。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of intrinsic (odometer scaling factors) and extrinsic
parameters (IMU-odometer translation and rotation) is essential for autonomous
ground vehicle localization. Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on
positioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their
observability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly
coupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS
measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable
factor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and
ambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal
translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion,
while vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world
experiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over
state-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer
positioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error
of 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent
improvement. To foster further research, we also release the first open-source
dataset that combines IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from both
rover and base stations.

Abstract: In-Hand Manipulation, as many other dexterous tasks, remains a difficult
challenge in robotics by combining complex dynamic systems with the capability
to control and manoeuvre various objects using its actuators. This work
presents the application of a previously developed hybrid Reinforcement
Learning (RL) Framework to In-Hand Manipulation task, verifying that it is
capable of improving the performance of the task. The model combines concepts
of both Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, by guiding a trained
policy with the help of a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory
evaluation, as done in Model Predictive Control. This work evaluates the
performance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided.
To fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated
and under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for
a given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for
generalization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both
the policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and
additionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the
same task in a different one. The results of this work show that, given a
policy with high average reward and an accurate dynamic model, the hybrid
framework improves the performance of in-hand manipulation tasks for most test
cases, even when the object properties are changed. However, this improvement
comes at the expense of increasing the computational cost, due to the
complexity of trajectory evaluation.

Motivation: 软体机器人在安全性和适应性方面具有显著优势，但因其复杂的非线性动力学特性，实现精确动态控制仍是一大挑战。DeePC作为一种无需显式系统识别的模型无关方法，在软体机器人领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发并实验验证了一种基于数据驱动的DeePC框架，结合SVD降维技术，应用于3D电缆驱动软体臂的控制任务。

Conclusion: DeePC框架在3D软体机器人控制中表现出更高的准确性、鲁棒性和适应性，展示了其作为动态控制实用解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Soft robots offer significant advantages in safety and adaptability, yet
achieving precise and dynamic control remains a major challenge due to their
inherently complex and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Data-enabled Predictive
Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses
explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While
DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots
remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic
systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally
validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm.
Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing
backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength
and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform,
we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension
reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory
tracking in 3D space. Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based
controller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability,
highlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft
robots.

Result: 提出的方法在C语言中实现，并证明比商业库Bullet更快。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种将一般二次曲面分类为轴对称二次曲面（AQ）的新方法，并解决了给定点到AQ的接近度问题。该方法在R^3中简化了问题，并通过几何特性在R^2中高效解决，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents the classification of a general quadric into an
axisymmetric quadric (AQ) and the solution to the problem of the proximity of a
given point to an AQ. The problem of proximity in $R^3$ is reduced to the same
in $R^2$, which is not found in the literature. A new method to solve the
problem in $R^2$ is used based on the geometrical properties of the conics,
such as sub-normal, length of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, slope and
radius. Furthermore, the problem in $R^2$ is categorised into two and three
more sub-cases for parabola and ellipse/hyperbola, respectively, depending on
the location of the point, which is a novel approach as per the authors'
knowledge. The proposed method is suitable for implementation in a common
programming language, such as C and proved to be faster than a commercial
library, namely, Bullet.

Abstract: Advances in the control of autonomous systems have accompanied an expansion
in the potential applications for autonomous robotic systems. The success of
applications involving humans depends on the quality of interaction between the
autonomous system and the human supervisor, which is particularly affected by
the degree of trust that the supervisor places in the autonomous system. Absent
from the literature are models of supervisor trust dynamics that can
accommodate asymmetric responses to autonomous system performance and the
intermittent nature of supervisor-autonomous system communication. This paper
focuses on formulating an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates
both of these features by employing a switched linear system structure with
event-triggered sampling of the model input and output. Trust response data
collected in a user study with 51 participants were then used identify
parameters for a switched linear model-based observer of supervisor trust.

Conclusion: iMoWM通过其多模态表示不仅提升了未来预测的视觉质量，还作为基于模型的强化学习（MBRL）的有效模拟器，并促进了真实世界的模仿学习。

Abstract: Learned world models hold significant potential for robotic manipulation, as
they can serve as simulator for real-world interactions. While extensive
progress has been made in 2D video-based world models, these approaches often
lack geometric and spatial reasoning, which is essential for capturing the
physical structure of the 3D world. To address this limitation, we introduce
iMoWM, a novel interactive world model designed to generate color images, depth
maps, and robot arm masks in an autoregressive manner conditioned on actions.
To overcome the high computational cost associated with three-dimensional
information, we propose MMTokenizer, which unifies multi-modal inputs into a
compact token representation. This design enables iMoWM to leverage large-scale
pretrained VideoGPT models while maintaining high efficiency and incorporating
richer physical information. With its multi-modal representation, iMoWM not
only improves the visual quality of future predictions but also serves as an
effective simulator for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and
facilitates real-world imitation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of iMoWM across these tasks, showcasing the advantages of
multi-modal world modeling for robotic manipulation. Homepage:

Motivation: 随着机器人越来越多地融入社会，检测机器人错误对于有效的人机交互至关重要。人类对机器人错误的反应会随着连续失败而演变，但现有研究很少探讨这些反应如何揭示连续失败。

Method: 研究使用机器学习方法，从视频数据中提取行为特征，训练针对个体用户的模型。

Conclusion: 通过建模人类反应的演变，研究提高了机器人错误检测的准确性，并加深了对人机交互中重复交互故障的理解。

Abstract: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is
essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails
repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally
respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over
successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible
frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can
indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses
reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize
stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants
interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral
features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users.
The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for
classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions
enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns
in HRI.

Abstract: Visual Teach-and-Repeat Navigation is a direct solution for mobile robot to
be deployed in unknown environments. However, robust trajectory repeat
navigation still remains challenged due to environmental changing and dynamic
objects. In this paper, we propose a novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation
system, which consists of a flexible map representation, robust map matching
and a map-less local navigation module. During the teaching process, the
recorded keyframes are formulated as a topo-metric graph and each node can be
further extended to save new observations. Such representation also alleviates
the requirement of globally consistent mapping. To enhance the place
recognition performance during repeating process, instead of using
frame-to-frame matching, we firstly implement keyframe clustering to aggregate
similar connected keyframes into local map and perform place recognition based
on visual frame-tolocal map matching strategy. To promote the local goal
persistent tracking performance, a long-term goal management algorithm is
constructed, which can avoid the robot getting lost due to environmental
changes or obstacle occlusion. To achieve the goal without map, a local
trajectory-control candidate optimization algorithm is proposed. Extensively
experiments are conducted on our mobile platform. The results demonstrate that
our system is superior to the baselines in terms of robustness and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: 通过从受限专家的演示中推断状态奖励信号，并利用时间插值自标记未知状态的奖励，本文提出的方法在样本效率和任务完成时间上均优于常见的模仿学习方法。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks
using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and
sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's
ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup
restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic
arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional
space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to
suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can
a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained
expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of
expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the
demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress,
and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our
approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and
task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12
seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on
https://sites.google.com/view/constrainedexpert .

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in unknown, structurally constrained, and GPS-denied
environments presents a fundamental trade-off between global strategic
foresight and local tactical agility, particularly under limited communication.
Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high
communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the
broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we
propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that
achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified
coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange
lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process
fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient,
trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires
the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a
sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts
by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently
satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive
simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system
significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in
communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.

Abstract: Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots
allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother
trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is
often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this
paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the
computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization.
Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to
sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned
Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We
propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with
permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model.
We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that
predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the
SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we
show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered
environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than
existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also
generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing
baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can
be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction
of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach
provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of
trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture
different collision-avoidance behaviors.

Motivation: 电动假手需要轻量化以减少用户负担，外形像人手以满足美观需求，并将电机内置以保护其免受损坏和污垢。此外，手内操作能力对于完成日常活动（如在不同姿势间转换，特别是通过旋转动作）至关重要。然而，现有的电动假手仅能实现静态抓取姿势，且现有操作方案要么需要多个电机导致假手过重，要么需要复杂机制占用大量内部空间并迫使电机外置，增加了安装难度和组件暴露风险。

Abstract: Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the
user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and have motors inside to
protect them from damage and dirt. In addition to the ability to perform daily
activities, these features are essential for everyday use of the hand. In-hand
manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning
between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as
reorienting cards before slot insertion and operating tools such as
screwdrivers. However, currently used electric prosthetic hands only achieve
static grasp postures, and existing manipulation approaches require either many
motors, which makes the prosthesis heavy for daily use in the hand, or complex
mechanisms that demand a large internal space and force external motor
placement, complicating attachment and exposing the components to damage.
Alternatively, we combine a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning
to achieve basic posture and in-hand manipulation, that is, the reorientation
between precision and lateral grasps, using only four motors in a lightweight
(311 g) prosthetic hand. Experimental validation using primitive objects of
various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in success
rates of 90-100% for reorientation tasks. The hand performed seal stamping and
USB device insertion, as well as rotation to operate a screwdriver.

Abstract: Seamless loco-manipulation in unstructured environments requires robots to
leverage autonomous exploration alongside whole-body control for physical
interaction. In this work, we introduce HANDO (Hierarchical Autonomous
Navigation and Dexterous Omni-loco-manipulation), a two-layer framework
designed for legged robots equipped with manipulators to perform human-centered
mobile manipulation tasks. The first layer utilizes a goal-conditioned
autonomous exploration policy to guide the robot to semantically specified
targets, such as a black office chair in a dynamic environment. The second
layer employs a unified whole-body loco-manipulation policy to coordinate the
arm and legs for precise interaction tasks-for example, handing a drink to a
person seated on the chair. We have conducted an initial deployment of the
navigation module, and will continue to pursue finer-grained deployment of
whole-body loco-manipulation.

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的运动规划方法需要大量训练数据或昂贵的人类演示。本研究旨在提供一种更高效的替代方案，仅需单个演示即可快速生成高质量轨迹。

Method: 通过将演示编码为动态运动原语（DMP），并利用策略强化学习迭代重塑，生成多样化的轨迹数据集。随后，训练一个神经网络，输入描述障碍物尺寸和位置的任务参数，输出生成轨迹的DMP参数。

Result: 该方法在计算和执行时间以及轨迹长度上优于RRT-Connect基线，并支持多模态轨迹生成。仿真和真实机器人实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于单个人工演示的动态运动原语（DMP）和策略强化学习的方法，能够快速生成平滑、近优且无碰撞的3D笛卡尔轨迹。该方法在仿真和真实机器人实验中表现优异，优于RRT-Connect基线，并支持多模态轨迹生成。

Abstract: Learning-based motion planning can quickly generate near-optimal
trajectories. However, it often requires either large training datasets or
costly collection of human demonstrations. This work proposes an alternative
approach that quickly generates smooth, near-optimal collision-free 3D
Cartesian trajectories from a single artificial demonstration. The
demonstration is encoded as a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) and iteratively
reshaped using policy-based reinforcement learning to create a diverse
trajectory dataset for varying obstacle configurations. This dataset is used to
train a neural network that takes as inputs the task parameters describing the
obstacle dimensions and location, derived automatically from a point cloud, and
outputs the DMP parameters that generate the trajectory. The approach is
validated in simulation and real-robot experiments, outperforming a RRT-Connect
baseline in terms of computation and execution time, as well as trajectory
length, while supporting multi-modal trajectory generation for different
obstacle geometries and end-effector dimensions. Videos and the implementation

as a powerful tool for open-environment pick-and-place tasks and as a valuable
engine for generating the data needed to train simulation-based foundation
models in robotics.

Conclusion: 该论文展示了Surrealist框架在工业四足机器人ANYmal上的成功应用，通过自动生成挑战性测试场景，显著提升了算法鲁棒性评估和验证流程的效率。

Abstract: Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key
challenge, as traditional testing methods often struggle to cover the full
spectrum of operational requirements. This paper presents the industrial
adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally
for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial
inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate
challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by
manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical
weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an
effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success
rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a
six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary
algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the
development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks,
and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.

TL;DR: FIPER是一种无需失败数据的生成式模仿学习策略运行时失败预测框架，通过OOD检测和动作不确定性指标，显著提升预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式模仿学习策略在分布偏移或动作错误累积时导致的不可预测和不安全行为问题。

Method: FIPER利用随机网络蒸馏检测OOD观测，并通过新颖的动作块熵分数衡量生成动作的不确定性，结合符合性预测校准阈值。

Result: FIPER在五个仿真和真实环境中优于现有方法，能更准确、更早地预测失败，并更好地区分实际失败与良性OOD情况。

Conclusion: FIPER框架通过结合OOD观测和动作不确定性指标，显著提升了生成式模仿学习策略在运行时失败预测的准确性和时效性，为更可解释和安全的机器人策略迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow
matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,
distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can
still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early
failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots
in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general
framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that
does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending
failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network
distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in
generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure
prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via
conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,
aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER
across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure
modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures
from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier
than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards
more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos
are available at https://tum-lsy.github.io/fiper_website.

Conclusion: FOGMACHINE通过结合动态场景图和离散事件模拟，为复杂、不确定环境中的具身AI提供了一个有效的工具，支持基准测试、模型训练和研究。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graphs (DSGs) provide a structured representation of
hierarchical, interconnected environments, but current approaches struggle to
capture stochastic dynamics, partial observability, and multi-agent activity.
These aspects are critical for embodied AI, where agents must act under
uncertainty and delayed perception. We introduce FOGMACHINE , an open-source
framework that fuses DSGs with discrete-event simulation to model object
dynamics, agent observations, and interactions at scale. This setup enables the
study of uncertainty propagation, planning under limited perception, and
emergent multi-agent behavior. Experiments in urban scenarios illustrate
realistic temporal and spatial patterns while revealing the challenges of
belief estimation under sparse observations. By combining structured
representations with efficient simulation, FOGMACHINE establishes an effective
tool for benchmarking, model training, and advancing embodied AI in complex,
uncertain environments.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的模仿学习框架，成功实现了软机器人导丝在未见过血管几何结构中的自主导航，成功率高达83%，优于多个基线模型。

Abstract: In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube
called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the
patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots,
aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance
maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.
Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome
these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular
navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown
promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning
framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic
contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire
navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different
modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under
simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular
geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the
aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,
outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline
studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection
choice. Project website: https://softrobotnavigation.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物通过其隐性被动动力学实现能量高效的运动，这一现象激发了机器人学家的长期兴趣。然而，现有的模仿学习方法主要关注显性运动模式（步态），忽视了隐性被动动力学。

Method: 本研究提出了一种结合Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF)和Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP)的方法，通过强化学习策略学习动物的显性运动轨迹和隐性被动动力学。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在能量效率方面实现了高达32%的提升，通过运输成本（CoT）衡量，在AMP和手工设计的奖励结构中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过结合Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF)和Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP)，本研究成功让强化学习策略同时学习动物的显性运动轨迹和隐性被动动力学，显著提升了能量效率。

Abstract: Animals achieve energy-efficient locomotion by their implicit passive
dynamics, a marvel that has captivated roboticists for decades.Recently,
methods incorporated Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) and Reinforcement learning
(RL) shows promising progress to replicate Animals' naturalistic motion.
However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit
kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive
dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by
Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a
robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our
approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from
animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy
efficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport
(CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments requires robots to
simultaneously explore, localise, and plan under uncertainty, without relying
on predefined maps or extensive training. We present a biologically inspired,
Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning
(AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within
a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses
topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide
behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns
state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free
Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We
implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and
robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It
operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports
both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We
demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments
against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's
adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor
noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable,
self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at

Motivation: 当前基于云的专有LLMs在隐私、自主性和可扩展性方面存在局限性，本地部署的开源模型有望成为更稳健和可信的交互范式。

Method: 通过对多个开源和开放访问模型与OpenAI的专有GPT-4系统进行比较分析，评估了它们在生成用户意图工作流方面的性能。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了本地可部署、开源和开放访问的大型语言模型（LLMs）作为未来基于意图的操作系统基础组件的可行性，并指出了其在隐私、自主性和可扩展性方面的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural
language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as
translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex
workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,
GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction
paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate
their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions
across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,
extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which
introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For
language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface
paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.
This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of
locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational
components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine
the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating
user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is
conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess
performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present
study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance
trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable
components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study
inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI
infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes
more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded
intelligence.

TL;DR: 研究分析了不同依赖版本约束类型对项目依赖过时或易受攻击风险的影响，发现浮动约束在减少风险方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开发者选择固定或浮动依赖版本约束的利弊，以及不同约束类型对依赖过时或易受攻击风险的影响，以提供更科学的决策依据。

Method: 研究首先识别了npm、PyPI和Cargo生态系统中依赖版本约束的使用趋势及开发者更改约束类型的模式，随后使用生存分析建模依赖状态转换，评估了使用固定约束与其他约束类型时依赖过时或易受攻击的可能性变化。

Result: 研究发现，在过时和易受攻击的依赖中，浮动次要版本约束最常见，固定约束次之；浮动主版本约束最不可能导致依赖过时，而浮动次要版本约束最不可能导致依赖易受攻击。

Conclusion: 研究通过实证分析帮助开发者在依赖版本约束选择上做出更明智的决策，揭示了不同约束类型对依赖过时或易受攻击的影响。

Abstract: Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable
versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can
reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually
managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other
hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security
fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners
advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain
attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the
tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in
outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or
vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The
goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency
version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of
dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at
scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version
constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by
developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the
dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the
likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning}
as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among
outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint
type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common.
We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in
outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable
dependencies.

Abstract: Code completion can help developers improve efficiency and ease the
development lifecycle. Although code completion is available in modern
integrated development environments (IDEs), research lacks in determining what
makes a good context for code completion based on the information available to
the IDEs for the large language models (LLMs) to perform better. In this paper,
we describe an effective context collection strategy to assist the LLMs in
performing better at code completion tasks. The key idea of our strategy is to
preprocess the repository into smaller code chunks and later use syntactic and
semantic similarity-based code chunk retrieval with relative positioning. We
found that code chunking and relative positioning of the chunks in the final
context improve the performance of code completion tasks.

Result: 研究发现LLMs能显著提升效率（通过自动化重复任务和文档）、增强沟通清晰度并促进跨职能协作，但也引入了新挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
development processes, with the potential to transform team workflows and
productivity. This paper investigates how LLMs affect team collaboration
throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). We reframe and update a
prior study with recent developments as of 2025, incorporating new literature
and case studies. We outline the problem of collaboration hurdles in SDLC and
explore how LLMs can enhance productivity, communication, and decision-making
in a team context. Through literature review, industry examples, a team survey,
and two case studies, we assess the impact of LLM-assisted tools (such as code
generation assistants and AI-powered project management agents) on
collaborative software engineering practices. Our findings indicate that LLMs
can significantly improve efficiency (by automating repetitive tasks and
documentation), enhance communication clarity, and aid cross-functional
collaboration, while also introducing new challenges like model limitations and
privacy concerns. We discuss these benefits and challenges, present research
questions guiding the investigation, evaluate threats to validity, and suggest
future research directions including domain-specific model customization,
improved integration into development tools, and robust strategies for ensuring
trust and security.

### [137] [Automating Android Build Repair: Bridging the Reasoning-Execution Gap in LLM Agents with Domain-Specific Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08640)
*Ha Min Son,Huan Ren,Xin Liu,Zhe Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了GradleFixer，一个通过领域特定工具提升LLM修复Android构建错误能力的代理，显著优于通用shell方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Android是最大的移动平台，但自动化构建应用仍面临挑战。LLM在代码修复中显示出潜力，但在修复Android构建错误方面的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究团队首先构建了AndroidBuildBench基准，包含1,019个构建失败案例，并提出了GradleFixer——一个配备领域特定工具的LLM代理，用于检查和操作Gradle构建环境。

Result: GradleFixer在AndroidBuildBench上实现了81.4%的解决率（pass@1），显著优于依赖通用shell的最先进编码代理。

Conclusion: GradleFixer通过工具桥接策略显著提升了LLM在修复Android构建错误时的表现，证明了领域特定工具在将高层次知识转化为有效低层操作中的关键作用。

Abstract: Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building
applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a
benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43
open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution
from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose
GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and
manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate
of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent
that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that
while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they
struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a
general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term
Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware
abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it
provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it
constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the
gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Faver是一种LLM友好的中间件，通过解耦验证细节提升RTL生成准确性，实验显示最高提升14%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM在RTL生成中由于高级规范与RTL之间的语义鸿沟及训练数据有限，导致生成准确性不足。Faver旨在通过简化验证流程来提升准确性。

Method: 提出了一种功能抽象的可验证中间件（Faver），通过混合LLM友好的代码结构和基于规则的模板，解耦电路验证细节，使LLM专注于功能本身。

Result: 在SFT模型和开源模型上的实验表明，Faver将模型的生成准确性最高提升了14%。

Conclusion: Faver通过将LLM友好的代码结构与基于规则的模板结合，有效提升了基于LLM的RTL生成的准确性，实验显示最高可提升14%。

Abstract: LLM-based RTL generation is an interesting research direction, as it holds
the potential to liberate the least automated stage in the current chip design.
However, due to the substantial semantic gap between high-level specifications
and RTL, coupled with limited training data, existing models struggle with
generation accuracy. Drawing on human experience, design with verification
helps improving accuracy. However, as the RTL testbench data are even more
scarce, it is not friendly for LLMs. Although LLMs excel at higher-level
languages like Python/C, they have a huge semantic gap from RTL. When
implementing the same functionality, Python/C code and hardware code differ
significantly in the spatiotemporal granularity, requiring the LLM not only to
consider high-level functional semantics but also to ensure the low-level
details align with the circuit code. It is not an easy task. In this paper, we
propose a function abstracted verifiable middleware (Faver) that streamlines
RTL verification in LLM-based workflows. By mixing LLM-friendly code structures
with a rule-based template, Faver decouples the details of circuit
verification, allowing the LLM to focus on the functionality itself. In our
experiments on the SFT model and open-source models, Faver improved the model's
generation accuracy by up to 14%.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多智能体和ReAct范式的可控代码生成框架，显著提升了安全性、准确性和可控性，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成模型在安全性、准确性和可控性方面存在不足，尤其是复杂任务中缺乏动态工具集成、透明推理和用户对安全性的控制。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，包含四个专门化智能体：Planner（任务分解）、Searcher（基于ReAct的推理与工具集成）、CodeGen（代码生成）和Extractor（结构化数据检索）。ReAct框架通过交替生成推理轨迹和执行动作，实现内部知识与外部工具的无缝集成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在多种语言中表现优异，尤其是在SVEN数据集上使用CodeQL时达到了94.8%的安全率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的可控代码生成框架通过多智能体协作和ReAct范式，显著提升了代码生成的安全性、准确性和可控性，实验结果表明其在多种语言中表现优异，尤其是在SVEN数据集上达到了94.8%的安全率。

Abstract: Code generation models based on large language models (LLMs) have gained wide
adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring safety, accuracy, and
controllability, especially for complex tasks. Existing methods often lack
dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control
over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation
framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This
framework is a multi-agent system designed to enable efficient, precise, and
interpretable code generation through dynamic interactions between LLMs and
external resources. The framework adopts a collaborative architecture
comprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a
Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration,
a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured
data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating
reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of
internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance
accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework's
effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8% security rate on the
SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent
reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.

TL;DR: 提出RAG框架整合语义嵌入和向量搜索，显著提升软件问题解决效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发团队因知识分散在JIRA票、开发者讨论和GitHub PR中，导致解决重复或相关问题延迟。

Method: 采用Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)框架，结合Sentence-Transformers生成语义嵌入和FAISS进行向量搜索，整合JIRA票、开发者讨论和GitHub PR数据。

Result: 实验评估显示，该系统在解决准确性、修复质量和知识重用方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的RAG框架通过整合语义嵌入和向量搜索，显著提高了软件问题解决的准确性、修复质量和知识重用效率，适用于现代DevOps环境。

Abstract: Modern software teams frequently encounter delays in resolving recurring or
related issues due to fragmented knowledge scattered across JIRA tickets,
developer discussions, and GitHub pull requests (PRs). To address this
challenge, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that
integrates Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings with FAISS-based
vector search to deliver context-aware ticket resolution recommendations. The
approach embeds historical JIRA tickets, user comments, and linked PR metadata
to retrieve semantically similar past cases, which are then synthesized by a
Large Language Model (LLM) into grounded and explainable resolution
suggestions. The framework contributes a unified pipeline linking JIRA and
GitHub data, an embedding and FAISS indexing strategy for heterogeneous
software artifacts, and a resolution generation module guided by retrieved
evidence. Experimental evaluation using precision, recall, resolution time
reduction, and developer acceptance metrics shows that the proposed system
significantly improves resolution accuracy, fix quality, and knowledge reuse in
modern DevOps environments.

TL;DR: BigCodeArena是一个开放的代码生成评估平台，支持实时执行LLM生成的代码。研究收集了大量数据，发现专有LLM在代码生成上仍领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在编码领域，手动评估LLM生成内容的质量极具挑战性，需要理解长段原始代码并模拟执行过程。

Method: 引入BigCodeArena平台，支持实时执行LLM生成的代码，并收集了14,000多个代码为中心的对话会话。基于这些数据，创建了BigCodeReward和AutoCodeArena两个基准。

Result: 大多数LLM在执行结果可用时，在判断编码偏好方面表现优异。AutoCodeArena基准能够自动评估LLM的编码质量。

Conclusion: 专有LLM（如GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4和Claude-Opus-4）在代码生成性能上仍领先于新兴模型。

Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable
real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model
responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of
LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding
long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this
end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code
generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment.
Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of
LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and
outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions
across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution
environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700
multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers
underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by
tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding
and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based
on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For
BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the
consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows
that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the
execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose
AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding
quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation
performance among recent emerging models.

TL;DR: 差分进化调优DynaMOSA和MIO超参数，显著提高覆盖率且比网格搜索更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索基础的测试生成算法有许多配置选项，用户通常使用默认值，这可能不是最佳选择。调优超参数可以找到更好的值，但资源消耗大。

Method: 探索差分进化作为调优DynaMOSA和MIO超参数的方法，并在Pynguin框架中实现。

Result: 调优后的DynaMOSA算法显著提高了测试套件的覆盖率，且差分进化比网格搜索更高效。

Conclusion: 使用差分进化算法调优DynaMOSA和MIO的超参数可以显著提高测试套件的覆盖率，且差分进化比基本的网格搜索更高效。

Abstract: Search-based test-generation algorithms have countless configuration options.
Users rarely adjust these options and usually stick to the default values,
which may not lead to the best possible results. Tuning an algorithm's
hyperparameters is a method to find better hyperparameter values, but it
typically comes with a high demand of resources. Meta-heuristic search
algorithms -- that effectively solve the test-generation problem -- have been
proposed as a solution to also efficiently tune parameters. In this work we
explore the use of differential evolution as a means for tuning the
hyperparameters of the DynaMOSA and MIO many-objective search algorithms as
implemented in the Pynguin framework. Our results show that significant
improvement of the resulting test suite's coverage is possible with the tuned
DynaMOSA algorithm and that differential evolution is more efficient than basic
grid search.

TL;DR: PyMigTool利用LLMs、静态和动态分析，自动化Python库迁移，显著提升准确性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动库迁移耗时且易错，现有自动化技术大多停留在API映射阶段或支持有限。

Method: 首先研究LLMs在321个真实世界库迁移基准上的能力，然后结合静态和动态分析开发PyMigTool。

Result: PyMigTool在717个非基准Python应用中，32%的迁移完全正确，剩余迁移中仅14%需要开发者修复。

Conclusion: PyMigTool通过结合LLMs、静态分析和动态分析，提供了一个准确且高效的库迁移工具，显著提升了自动化迁移的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Library migration is the process of replacing a library with a similar one in
a software project. Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone,
as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces
(API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code
transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most
of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage
or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper,
we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between
any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due
to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code
generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration.
Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library
migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that
LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps
can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a
command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and
dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool
on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find
that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of
the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left
for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.

Abstract: When learning to code, students often develop misconceptions about various
programming language concepts. These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient
code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we
introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples
of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining
systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together
with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We
then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive
evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are
effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging
techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during
debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic

Motivation: 现代代码库使得开发者和AI编码助手难以在回答问题时找到正确的源文件。传统代码搜索方法缺乏语义上下文和跨文件链接，而大型语言模型理解自然语言但缺乏仓库特定细节。

Method: 本文采用六种代码感知策略生成训练数据，利用AST结构和仓库内容构建问题-答案对。通过QLoRA和Unsloth优化微调Qwen3-8B模型，直接预测文件路径。

Result: 在Flask、Click、Jinja、FastAPI和PyTorch等Python项目上，模型取得了高达91%的精确匹配和93%的召回率。在PyTorch（约4000个Python文件）等大型代码库中，模型达到59%的召回率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的文件路径检索方法，通过QLoRA和Unsloth优化微调Qwen3-8B模型，直接从自然语言查询预测相关文件路径。实验结果表明，该方法在多个Python项目中表现出高检索准确率，并展示了在大规模代码库中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Modern codebases make it hard for developers and AI coding assistants to find
the right source files when answering questions like "How does this feature
work?" or "Where was the bug introduced?" Traditional code search (keyword or
IR based) often misses semantic context and cross file links, while large
language models (LLMs) understand natural language but lack repository specific
detail. We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong
LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file
paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we
introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST)
structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs,
where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file
prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine
tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch,
and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\% exact match and 93\% recall on
held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase
like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\% recall, showing
scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over
cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context
length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based
code intelligence.

Abstract: We present a repository decomposition system that converts large software
repositories into a vectorized knowledge graph which mirrors project
architectural and semantic structure, capturing semantic relationships and
allowing a significant level of automatization of further repository

Conclusion: SEER框架通过早期识别、评估和优化可持续性需求，有效支持了软件开发中的可持续性实践，并在多领域项目中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of software development has significant environmental,
technical, social, and economic impacts. Achieving the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable
practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are
time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus
on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at
the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a
framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software
development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies
sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from
a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are
based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that
fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning
capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented
Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from
different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately
identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究中的可持续性要求（SRs）往往分散、局限于特定维度或应用领域，缺乏统一的分类法。

Method: 通过系统性文献综述（SLR）提取和组织了现有研究中的可持续性要求。

Result: 研究提出了一个全面的SRs分类法，包括定义、度量标准、措施，以及维度间的相关性矩阵。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个跨四个可持续性维度（环境、技术、社会和经济）的综合SRs分类法，为软件开发者和管理者提供了清晰的参考框架。

Abstract: Software systems are a significant contributor to global sustainability
concerns, demanding that environmental, social, technical, and economic factors
be systematically addressed from the initial requirements engineering phase.
Although existing research provides various sustainability requirements (SRs),
these contributions are often fragmented, specific to certain dimensions, or
limited to particular application domains, resulting in a critical lack of a
unified, comprehensive taxonomy for the software engineering community. To
address this gap, this research conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
to extract and organize sustainability requirements from the state-of-the-art.
The primary contribution is a comprehensive taxonomy of SRs across the four
dimensions of sustainability (environmental, technical, social, and economic).
For each identified category, we provide clear definitions, associated metrics,
and measures. Furthermore, we depict a correlation matrix that projects the
positive and negative influences (synergies and conflicts) among categories
across different dimensions. This systematized reference assists both software
developers and researchers in effectively formulating, managing, and
reconciling trade-offs within sustainable software development.

Result: 应用新框架后，发现现有基准对某些模型的能力高估超过50%（公共基准）和10-16%（内部基准）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的基准测试框架，通过将现有的正式基准转化为现实用户查询，揭示了现有基准在评估聊天式软件工程代理时的系统性高估问题。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as
SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to
accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in
integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads
to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios,
especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that
transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through
systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents.
Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks.
In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the
TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and
transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries
based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our
findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent
capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public
benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new
paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents
through benchmark mutation techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过标识符替换提升LLMs长代码翻译效率的零样本方法，实证显示其能减少标记数量并保留代码结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长源代码翻译中因上下文窗口限制导致的翻译不准确问题。

Method: 采用标识符替换技术，将用户给定的长标识符替换为通用占位符，以减少标记数量和内存使用。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法能保留代码的语法和层次结构信息，并减少翻译结果中的标记数量。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的零样本代码翻译方法，通过标识符替换来提升长代码翻译的效率和成本效益。

Abstract: In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate
tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language
is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs
often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window,
which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel
zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By
substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during
translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the
code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency
and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results
demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical
information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLM在软件开发实践中的实际使用情况以及专业人士对其优势和局限的认知。

Method: 通过全球调查131名软件从业者，收集了关于LLM在实际应用中的使用情况和看法。

Result: 结果显示LLM被用于多种编码任务，带来了生产力提升、认知负荷减少和学习加速等好处，但也存在输出不准确、上下文意识有限和伦理风险等问题。大多数开发者将LLM视为辅助工具而非独立解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究提供了从业者对LLM在软件开发中应用的早期视角，强调了未来研究和负责任使用LLM的关键考虑。

Abstract: Large Language Models have quickly become a central component of modern
software development workflows, and software practitioners are increasingly
integrating LLMs into various stages of the software development lifecycle.
Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of
how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive
their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a
global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are
utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report
benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster
learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited
context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as
assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet
practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early,
practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key
considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统代码注释（缺乏全局上下文）和设计文档（缺乏与代码的具体连接）在程序文档中的不足。

Method: 提出并实现了一个名为TReX的工具，用于创建交互式、可视化且语义准确的literate traces。

Result: 成功应用TReX为Linux内核、Git和GCC等大型系统编写了literate traces。

Conclusion: Literate tracing是一种有效的程序文档范式，通过交互式、可视化的工具TReX实现，能够准确反映程序语义，适用于大型系统如Linux内核、Git和GCC。

Abstract: As computer systems grow ever larger and more complex, a crucial task in
software development is for one person (the system expert) to communicate to
another (the system novice) how a certain program works. This paper reports on
the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call
literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated,
concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both
in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs
(which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX,
our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and
guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have
used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems
software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC
compiler.

TL;DR: PynguinML通过利用API约束改进Pynguin，生成合规输入，显著提升ML库测试覆盖率和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于ML API常涉及复杂数据结构（如张量）的严格输入约束，现有自动化测试生成工具（如Pynguin）常因生成不合规输入而失败，导致测试覆盖不足。

Method: PynguinML是一种改进Pynguin测试生成器的方法，利用从官方API文档中提取的约束条件生成符合要求的输入。

Result: 在PyTorch和TensorFlow的165个模块上评估，PynguinML相比Pynguin显著提高了测试有效性，代码覆盖率最高提升63.9%。

Conclusion: PynguinML通过利用API文档中的约束条件，显著提高了测试生成的有效性，实现了高达63.9%的代码覆盖率提升。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are essential
for a wide range of modern applications. Ensuring the correctness of ML
libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict
input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated
test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and
often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and
limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from
official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach
that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to
generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and
higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and
TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that
PynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 %
higher code coverage.

TL;DR: PMDT是一个基于本体论的患者医学数字孪生框架，整合了多模态健康数据，支持语义互操作性和隐私保护，为慢性病管理提供了统一基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字孪生应用多为器官特异性或局限于孤立数据类型，缺乏统一且隐私保护的基础。因此，需要一种能够整合多模态健康数据的框架，以支持精确、自适应和预防性的决策。

Method: 本文提出了患者医学数字孪生（PMDT），这是一个基于本体论的框架，通过OWL 2.0实现语义互操作性、自动推理和跨临床场景的复用。其本体围绕模块化蓝图构建，并通过专家研讨会、问卷调查和真实世界免疫治疗患者的试点研究进行了迭代优化和验证。

Result: 评估证实了PMDT本体的覆盖范围、推理正确性、可用性和GDPR合规性。PMDT能够统一异构数据，操作能力问题，并支持描述性、预测性和规范性分析。

Conclusion: PMDT为下一代数字健康生态系统提供了一个经过验证的基础，通过弥合数据碎片化和语义标准化的差距，实现了慢性病管理的主动、持续优化和公平性。

Abstract: Personalized chronic care requires the integration of multimodal health data
to enable precise, adaptive, and preventive decision-making. Yet most current
digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data
types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper
introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in
silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial,
behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model.
Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports
automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its
ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and
diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse
events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively
refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot
study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients.
Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and
GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous
data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive,
and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By
bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT
provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems,
transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and
equitable management.

Motivation: 解决医疗AI实践中因数据源分散、隐私规则严格和技术复杂性而受限的问题。

Method: 提出了一种专门为医疗AI设计的MDE框架，该框架基于形式化元模型、领域特定语言（DSLs）和自动化转换，从高级规范到运行软件。核心是医学互操作性语言（MILA），一种图形化DSL，结合联邦学习架构。

Result: 在多中心癌症免疫治疗研究中，生成的管道表现出强大的预测性能，支持向量机在关键任务中达到98.5%和98.3%的准确率，同时显著减少手动编码工作。

Conclusion: 模型驱动工程（MDE）原则，包括元建模、语义集成和自动化代码生成，为实现互操作、可重复且可信赖的数字健康平台提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by
supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its
adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict
privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering
(MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies
on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated
transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At
its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that
enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning
pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning
architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw
patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving
privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy
study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with
support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy
in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings
suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated
code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable,
reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.

TL;DR: TIT通过树结构指令调优解决了LLM代码翻译中的语法混淆和语义对齐问题，显著提升了翻译成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流基于LLM的代码翻译方法对语言特定特征高度敏感，且因过度依赖函数级并行数据集导致语义对齐不足。

Method: TIT由三个模块组成：1. 语法信息表示模块通过结构化解析集成语言无关的语法特征；2. 细粒度并行数据集增强模块通过语句级分割和对比匹配对齐节点与代码段；3. 双阶段树指令调优模块分阶段进行语法感知微调和代码生成微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，TIT方法在多个LLM中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TIT方法在多个LLM中显著优于现有方法，代码翻译成功率提高了1.22倍至1.75倍，同时显著减少了语法混淆。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated
source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code
corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two
critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific
features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the
output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic
alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,
resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original
source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured
Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT
consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the
syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic
syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality
fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation
module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and
contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction
tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused
by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs
syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend
structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code
generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code
based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing
approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in
code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.

Motivation: 提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能，通过解释工具增强LLM的设计能力。

Method: （1）将LLM暴露于启发式表现不佳的实例；（2）解释原因；（3）针对输入空间中的特定区域进行设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法在最坏情况下性能提升约28倍，平均性能也有所提高，且运行时间保持不变。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLMs与解释工具，可以生成更鲁棒和性能更好的启发式算法，其最坏情况性能比FunSearch提升约28倍，同时保持运行时间。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为不受特定研究问题限制的探索性发现提供了机会，需要支持持续探索的框架。

Method: 引入AScience框架，实现为ASCollab，一个基于LLM的研究代理分布式系统，代理自组织成动态网络，持续产生和同行评审发现。

Result: 实验显示，社交动态使专家评分结果在多样性-质量-新颖性前沿积累，包括重新发现已知生物标志物、扩展已知途径和提出新治疗靶点。

Conclusion: AScience框架通过代理、网络和评估规范的交互，支持大规模科学数据集的探索性发现，实验证明其在癌症队列中能持续进行假设搜索。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively critique VRP routes, improving last-mile logistics efficiency and reliability, especially in India.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of VRP-based solvers in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance estimation.

Method: The study proposes a framework using large language models (LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, generating, annotating, and evaluating 400 cases.

Result: Open-source LLMs identified routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved up to 86% accuracy.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation of VRP-generated routes can significantly improve cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially in developing countries like India.

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

Motivation: 当前模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作错位，限制了在新颖或动态场景中的适应性。UniWM旨在通过统一框架克服这一限制。

Method: UniWM是一个统一的、内存增强的世界模型，采用多模态自回归主干，将视觉预见和规划整合在一起。通过分层记忆机制，结合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文，实现稳定、连贯的长期推理。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，UniWM显著提高了导航成功率（高达30%），减少了轨迹误差，并在未见的TartanDrive数据集上展示了出色的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM作为一种统一的世界模型，通过整合视觉预见和规划，显著提升了导航成功率，并展示了出色的零样本泛化能力，为基于想象的具身导航提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Motivation: 解决LLM代理在长时任务中因上下文管理不善导致的错误累积、幻觉或连贯性丧失问题。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含主代理、元思考者和上下文管理器三个专门化组件，分别负责战术执行、战略监督和上下文组织。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个基准测试中，COMPASS将准确率相对提升了20%，并通过扩展与后训练流程匹配了DeepResearch代理的性能。

Conclusion: COMPASS框架通过分层设计显著提升了LLM代理在长时任务中的表现，同时通过测试时扩展和后训练流程进一步优化了性能与效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格，尤其是在这一主观性极强的领域。

Method: 通过两项对照实验（Study 1和Study 2），分别比较人类和AI模型对文学段落的评价，测试归因偏见的普遍性。

Result: 人类和AI均表现出系统性偏向人类的归因偏见，AI模型的偏见强度是人类的2.5倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明，AI系统不仅复制了人类在审美判断中的归因偏见，还放大了这种偏见，显示出更强的反AI创作倾向。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewerToo框架通过AI辅助同行评审，提升了评审的一致性和质量，但人类专家在复杂评估中仍不可或缺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同行评审是科学出版的核心，但存在不一致性、评审主观性和可扩展性挑战。本文旨在通过AI辅助同行评审来补充人类判断，提供系统化和一致的评估。

Method: 引入了ReviewerToo框架，支持与专业评审角色和结构化评估标准进行系统实验，并可部分或完全整合到实际会议流程中。使用gpt-oss-120b模型在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文提交数据集上进行了验证。

Result: 实验显示，gpt-oss-120b模型在论文接受/拒绝分类任务上达到81.8%的准确率（人类评审平均为83.9%）。ReviewerToo生成的评审在LLM评估中质量高于人类平均水平，但仍落后于最强专家贡献。AI在事实核查和文献覆盖方面表现优异，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 本文提出了系统化、混合式的同行评审系统，为科学出版的扩展提供了基础，展示了AI如何增强一致性、覆盖范围和公平性，同时将复杂的评估判断留给领域专家。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTAlign通过博弈论机制优化LLM与用户交互，提升回答效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设模型奖励最大化即用户福利最大化，但实践中常导致冗长或过度解释的回答，类似囚徒困境。GTAlign旨在通过博弈论实现双赢。

Method: 提出Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign)框架，在推理和训练中引入博弈论决策机制，包括构建收益矩阵和互惠奖励。

Result: 实验表明GTAlign在推理效率、答案质量和互惠福利上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GTAlign框架通过博弈论决策机制显著提升了LLM的推理效率、答案质量和用户福利，相比基线方法在多任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有的LMMs基准测试往往无法捕捉其在实时对抗环境中的表现，因此需要一种新的评估框架。

Method: 通过将六种领先的开源和闭源模型置于经典格斗游戏《Mortal Kombat II》中，让它们控制相同角色进行公平比较，模型需要根据游戏帧和状态数据选择下一步行动。

Result: LM Fight Arena 提供了一个完全自动化、可重复且客观的评估方法，用于衡量LMMs在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: LM Fight Arena 提供了一个创新的、动态的基准测试框架，用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在实时对抗环境中的表现，填补了AI评估与互动娱乐之间的空白。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个利用机制可解释性检测LLM数据污染的框架，通过区分记忆与推理响应，准确率达93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染对可靠的LLM评估构成重大挑战，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非展示真实推理能力来获得高性能。

Method: RADAR框架通过提取37个特征（涵盖表面置信度轨迹和深层机制特性如注意力专门化、电路动态和激活流模式），并利用这些特征的分类器集成来实现检测。

Result: RADAR在多样化评估集上达到93%的准确率，在明确案例中表现完美，在具有挑战性的模糊案例中达到76.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了机制可解释性在超越传统表面指标方面对LLM评估的潜力，RADAR框架在区分基于记忆和基于推理的模型响应方面表现出色。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基准测试仅关注特定方面（如检索）的局限性，全面评估RAG流水线的能力。

Method: 提出了一个包含93个问题的小型人工创建数据集，用于评估流水线处理文本、表格、图像及跨模态数据的能力；引入了短语级召回指标和最近邻嵌入分类器；比较了2个开源检索机制和4个闭源基础模型。

Conclusion: 闭源流水线在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源流水线，尤其是在依赖多模态和跨文档信息的问题上。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类利用提示激活实体中心记忆痕迹的认知神经科学研究启发，旨在开发一种轻量级且高效的实体中心知识图谱RAG框架。

Method: EcphoryRAG在索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及元数据，检索阶段通过提取查询中的提示实体进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，并动态推断实体间的隐式关系以填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，EcphoryRAG将平均精确匹配（EM）分数从0.392提升至0.474，优于现有KG-RAG方法。

Conclusion: EcphoryRAG通过实体提示和多跳检索范式，显著提升了复杂问答任务的性能，验证了其实体中心方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架在复杂科学推理中存在上下文污染、证据支持不足和执行路径脆弱等问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图，分别处理背景知识和执行来源，并采用熵门控规则融合两者的路径证据。

Result: 在HLE和GPQA科学推理基准测试中，DualResearch表现优异，使用InternAgent日志文件后，HLE准确率提升7.7%，GPQA提升6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch通过结合广度语义图和深度因果图，有效解决了现有深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持不足和执行路径脆弱等问题，显著提升了科学推理的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

Motivation: 现有的前缀调优方法简单地拼接知识嵌入与文本输入，忽略了知识图中丰富的语义关系，并给大型语言模型带来了权利要求 implicit reasoning负担。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块（使用图神经网络提取上下文感知的语义条件）和条件自适应融合模块（通过JavaScript.One parameterized然后就 projectors自适应调制文本嵌入）。

Result: 在知识图基准测试中，SCT显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线方法，证实了其更准确和鲁棒的知识推理能力。

Conclusion: SCT（Semantic-condition TuningProviding）通过将语义图上下文调制到输入表示中，为知识推理提供了更直接和有效的信号，显著提升了知识图完成任务的性能。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V 是一种轻量级 3B 模型，通过 LIPO 和 AMM 两阶段优化，实现了高效的多模态推理，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多样化任务中表现出色，但在推理效率方面仍面临挑战（如模型过大、过度思考、轻量级场景下准确性下降）。当前对轻量级 MLLMs 推理能力的研究较少。

Method: Tiny-R1V 采用两阶段优化方法：第一阶段使用 LIPO（一种新颖的强化学习方法）训练每个推理模型；第二阶段通过 AMM（无需训练的模型合并方法）将多个专家模型合并为统一架构。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试中（涵盖数学、结构化数据、OCR 和通用能力），Tiny-R1V 表现优异，证明了轻量级模型在多模态推理任务中的潜力。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V 通过两阶段优化（LIPO 和 AMM）实现了更快的推理速度和更高的准确性，统一了多模态推理任务，并减少了 token 使用量，展示了轻量级模型在多模态推理任务中的卓越性能。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个综合旅行规划基准，统一评估标准并支持RL，实验表明RL在提高行程可行性方面优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅行规划是一项有价值但复杂的任务，即使是先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）也面临重大挑战。现有基准在评估LLMs的规划能力时，往往忽略了旅行计划的可行性、可靠性和吸引力。

Method: 引入了统一的细粒度标准作为单一奖励的全面旅行规划基准，支持与强化学习（RL）的无缝集成。评估器与旅行专家注释的中等一致性（60.75%），并优于多个LLM-as-judge基线。

Result: 评估器与专家注释的一致性达到60.75%，优于多个基线。RL方法在提高行程可行性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 强化学习（RL）在提高旅行行程可行性方面表现优于仅提示和监督基线，产生了更高的统一奖励分数。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Motivation: 评估SOTA LLMs在评分证明方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和公平评分。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的90个解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案集，通过多步骤评分流程和问题特定评分标准进行分析。

Result: 模型能可靠标记错误解决方案，但在部分学分分配上存在校准差距。提出的工作流程提高了与人类评分的一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的工作流程在标注语料库和MathArena上实现了与人类评分更高的一致性，并在部分学分处理上表现更一致。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前正则表达式修复方法存在局限性：符号系统精确但无法修复未见或复杂漏洞，而LLM具有泛化能力但缺乏可靠性。

Method: 采用混合框架LRR，先通过符号模块定位漏洞子模式，再利用LLM生成语义等效的修复方案。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种混合框架LRR，结合了符号系统和LLM的优势，成功解决了复杂正则表达式修复问题，修复率比现有技术提高了15.4%p。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出连续记忆方法改进 GUI 代理，性能接近闭源模型，显著降低上下文成本并保留视觉信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 GUI 代理将过去轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件大小和位置）。

Method: 提出了一种连续记忆方法，将 GUI 轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，利用 VLM 作为编码器，显著降低上下文成本并保留精细视觉信息。同时引入自动扩展的数据飞轮，包括环境搜索、任务合成、轨迹生成和验证。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度的增加，性能持续提升，而文本记忆在长提示下性能下降。通过 100k+ 轨迹数据和 1,500 样本微调，实现了显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: Qwen-2.5-VL-7B 结合连续记忆的 GUI 代理在长任务和分布偏移下表现优异，性能接近闭源模型（如 GPT-4o、Claude-4）。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

TL;DR: 研究结合精神分析和MBTI理论构建AI意识模块，评估显示其能较好模拟人类认知，为复杂AI交互提供新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型虽在多个领域取得进展，但模拟人类意识仍面临挑战，尤其是幻觉问题。因此，研究旨在通过精神分析和MBTI理论构建更直观、适应性强的AI意识系统。

Method: 研究提出了结合精神分析和MBTI理论的方法，构建了三种人工意识模块和16种MBTI性格角色，并通过十种情境和七种属性评估其认知能力。评估方法包括问卷调查、ChatGPT三级分类和定性分析。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明，模型能较好地模拟人类意识，尽管不同性格和意识模块间的响应差异不显著。这证明了模型在模拟人类认知方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究通过整合精神分析和MBTI理论，成功构建了具有人类意识特征的AI系统，为复杂认知情境下的AI交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

TL;DR: MEC$^3$O是一个多专家共识系统，通过分配LLM到特定复杂度类别并整合其预测，显著提升了代码复杂度预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在未微调时对某些复杂度类别表现不佳，缺乏单一模型能全面覆盖所有类别。

Method: 提出MEC$^3$O系统，基于LLM的性能分配复杂度类别，并为其提供类别专用指令，通过结构化辩论和加权共识机制整合预测。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC$^3$O比开源基线模型准确率和macro-F1分数至少提高10%，并在部分指标上与GPT-4o系列模型持平。

Conclusion: MEC$^3$O通过多专家共识系统有效提升了代码时间复杂度的预测性能，优于现有基线模型，并在特定指标上与GPT-4o系列模型表现相当。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种无训练、推理时控制机制，通过特征空间目标和正交随机扰动提升文本到图像生成的多样性，同时保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，导致用户需要多次采样以发现多样模式，效率低下且成本高昂。

Method: 提出了一种无训练、推理时控制机制，通过特征空间目标促进轨迹间的横向扩展，并引入时间调度的随机扰动以增加不确定性。扰动被投影为与生成流正交，确保不影响图像细节或提示保真度。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque）上优于基线，同时保持图像质量和对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法通过特征空间目标和时间调度的随机扰动，在保持图像质量和提示保真度的同时，显著提升了文本到图像生成的多样性。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Method: 研究提出了一种基于Stackelberg竞争的强化学习框架，用于训练AI代理在社交推理游戏中优化对话策略以实现说服目标。

Result: 在三种不同的社交推理游戏中，实验表明所提出的代理显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 本研究通过将Stackelberg竞争模型应用于社交推理游戏中的对话策略，结合强化学习框架，显著提升了AI代理的说服能力，为需要战略性社交影响的场景提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在部署时通常面临高计算成本的问题，现有动态切换方法缺乏统计保证和性能损失控制。

Method: 构建了一个关于性能损失的上置信界，作为不确定性得分的单调函数，并确定切换至非思考模式的阈值。

Result: 在推理基准测试中的全面实验表明，该方法能够节省计算预算并控制用户指定的性能损失。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为PAC推理的新方法，通过动态切换思考与非思考模式，在保证性能损失可控的前提下显著节省计算资源。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

Motivation: 随着LLM在医疗领域应用的普及，其在低资源环境中展现出巨大潜力，但现有评估缺乏对医疗社会性的洞察，忽视了健康差异和偏见可能对LLM生成的医疗建议的影响。

Method: 通过模拟不同性别、年龄和种族的患者档案，分析LLM对一系列医学问题的回答，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: 研究发现，LLM生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，尤其是对原住民和双性人群体的建议可读性更低、更复杂，且交叉群体中这种趋势更为明显。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁提高AI素养，并强调AI开发者急需调查和缓解LLM在生成医疗建议时的系统性差异，以避免不公平的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to

medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the

Motivation: 尽管LLMs和LRMs在自然语言处理、数学推理和编程方面表现出色，但其计算限制（尤其是受限于有限上下文窗口的空间复杂性）仍未被充分理解。

Method: 通过双指数空间探索构建了一个包含超过一百万正则表达式实例的标记数据集，并进行了广泛的评估，涉及6个LLMs和5个LRMs。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入基于PSPACE完全正则表达式问题的新基准，首次实证研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）和大规模推理模型（LRMs）的空间计算限制，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型在可解释性和高效性之间的权衡问题，提出了一种能够动态调整内部表示的新框架。

Method: 通过组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，实现了无需重新训练即可动态控制表示局部化的程度。

Result: 数学证明表明，当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，模型的注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架通过可调参数实现了语言模型在可解释性与高性能之间的连续切换，为需要透明度和能力的监管领域应用提供了支持。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in

small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Motivation: 神经符号人工智能（AI）领域因符号组件提供抽象而神经网络组件提供泛化能力，两者的结合有望推动AI的快速发展。然而，现有框架难以扩展，且神经方法的隐式表示和近似推理限制了可解释性和可信度。知识图谱（KG）作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示，可以解决符号侧的问题。

Method: 提出了GraphMERT，一种微小的图形编码器模型，用于从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量的知识图谱（KG）。

Result: 在PubMed关于糖尿病的论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的KG在FActScore上达到69.8%，而32B参数的基线LLM仅为40.2%。GraphMERT KG的ValidityScore也更高，为68.8%，基线为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT与知识图谱（KG）的结合首次实现了高效、可扩展的神经符号模型，在基准测试中达到了最先进的准确性，并提供了优于基线的符号表示。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个新基准测试，用于评估LLMs的编程能力。GPT-5表现优异但不及人类顶尖选手，开源模型性能差距显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在挑战性问题不足、测试用例覆盖不全、依赖在线平台API等问题，需更全面的评估工具。

Method: 引入LiveOIBench基准测试，包含403个专家筛选的奥林匹克级编程问题，每个问题平均60个测试用例。问题来自2023至2025年的72个官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛。

Result: GPT-5达到81.76百分位，表现强劲但不及人类顶尖选手（90百分位以上）。开源模型GPT-OSS-120B仅60百分位，与前沿闭源模型差距显著。

Conclusion: GPT-5在LiveOIBench基准测试中表现优异，但仍不及顶尖人类选手，而开源模型的性能差距显著。未来模型应注重结构化分析，减少不必要的探索。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

### [195] [The Online Submodular Cover Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08883)
*Anupam Gupta,Roie Levin*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在线子模覆盖问题的多对数竞争算法，解决了动态子模函数覆盖的在线实现难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线子模覆盖问题，旨在解决网络监控和资源分配中的实际问题，如随时间动态变化的子模函数覆盖需求。

Method: 通过在线方式解决指数级线性规划松弛问题，并进行在线舍入，克服了传统贪婪方法在在线设置中的实现困难。

Result: 算法在输入序列长度为T时，竞争比为O(ln n ln (T⋅f(N)/f_min))，其中f_min为子模函数的最小非零边际值。

Conclusion: 本文提出了在线子模覆盖问题的多对数竞争算法，竞争比为O(ln n ln (T⋅f(N)/f_min))，与现有最佳离线算法相比具有竞争力。

Abstract: In the submodular cover problem, we are given a monotone submodular function
$f$, and we want to pick the min-cost set $S$ such that $f(S) = f(N)$.
Motivated by problems in network monitoring and resource allocation, we
consider the submodular cover problem in an online setting. As a concrete
example, suppose at each time $t$, a nonnegative monotone submodular function
$g_t$ is given to us. We define $f^{(t)} = \sum_{s \leq t} g_s$ as the sum of
all functions seen so far. We need to maintain a submodular cover of these
submodular functions $f^{(1)}, f^{(2)}, \ldots f^{(T)}$ in an online fashion;
i.e., we cannot revoke previous choices. Formally, at each time $t$ we produce
a set $S_t \subseteq N$ such that $f^{(t)}(S_t) = f^{(t)}(N)$ -- i.e., this set
$S_t$ is a cover -- such that $S_{t-1} \subseteq S_t$, so previously decisions
to pick elements cannot be revoked. (We actually allow more general sequences
$\{f^{(t)}\}$ of submodular functions, but this
sum-of-simpler-submodular-functions case is useful for concreteness.)
  We give polylogarithmic competitive algorithms for this online submodular
cover problem. The competitive ratio on an input sequence of length $T$ is
$O(\ln n \ln (T \cdot f(N) / f_{\text{min}}))$, where $f_{\text{min}}$ is the
smallest nonzero marginal for functions $f^{(t)}$, and $|N| = n$. For the
special case of online set cover, our competitive ratio matches that of Alon et
al. [SIAM J. Comp. 03], which are best possible for polynomial-time online
algorithms unless $NP \subseteq BPP$ (see Korman 04). Since existing offline
algorithms for submodular cover are based on greedy approaches which seem
difficult to implement online, the technical challenge is to (approximately)
solve the exponential-sized linear programming relaxation for submodular cover,
and to round it, both in the online setting.

Abstract: In length-constrained minimum spanning tree (MST) we are given an $n$-node
graph $G = (V,E)$ with edge weights $w : E \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ and edge
lengths $l: E \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ along with a root node $r \in V$ and a
length-constraint $h \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. Our goal is to output a spanning
tree of minimum weight according to $w$ in which every node is at distance at
most $h$ from $r$ according to $l$.
  We give a polynomial-time algorithm for planar graphs which, for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$, outputs an $O\left(\log^{1+\epsilon} n\right)$-approximate
solution with every node at distance at most $(1+\epsilon)h$ from $r$ for any
constant $\epsilon > 0$. Our algorithm is based on new length-constrained
versions of classic planar separators which may be of independent interest.
Additionally, our algorithm works for length-constrained Steiner tree.
Complementing this, we show that any algorithm on general graphs for
length-constrained MST in which nodes are at most $2h$ from $r$ cannot achieve
an approximation of $O\left(\log ^{2-\epsilon} n\right)$ for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$ under standard complexity assumptions; as such, our results
separate the approximability of length-constrained MST in planar and general
graphs.

Abstract: This work introduces two techniques for the design and analysis of branching
algorithms, illustrated through the case study of the Vertex Cover problem.
First, we present a method for automatically generating branching rules through
a systematic case analysis of local structures. Second, we develop a new
technique for analyzing randomized branching algorithms using the Measure &
Conquer method, offering greater flexibility in formulating branching rules. By
combining these innovations with additional techniques, we obtain the fastest
known randomized algorithms in different parameters for the Vertex Cover
problem on graphs with bounded degree (up to 6) and on general graphs. For
example, our algorithm solves Vertex Cover on subcubic graphs in
$O^*(1.07625^n)$ time and $O^*(1.13132^k)$ time, respectively. For graphs with
maximum degree 4, we achieve running times of $O^*(1.13735^n)$ and
$O^*(1.21103^k)$, while for general graphs we achieve $O^*(1.25281^k)$.

Motivation: 研究如何选择有限数量的广告位以最大化影响力，特别是在推广多个产品且每个产品有不同影响力需求的情况下。

Conclusion: 通过真实世界轨迹和广告牌数据集的广泛实验，验证了所提出解决方案的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Billboard Advertisement has emerged as an effective out-of-home advertisement
technique where the goal is to select a limited number of slots and play
advertisement content over there with the hope that this will be observed by
many people, and effectively, a significant number of them will be influenced
towards the brand. Given a trajectory and a billboard database and a positive
integer $k$, how can we select $k$ highly influential slots to maximize
influence? In this paper, we study a variant of this problem where a commercial
house wants to make a promotion of multiple products, and there is an influence
demand for each product. We have studied two variants of the problem. In the
first variant, our goal is to select $k$ slots such that the respective
influence demand of each product is satisfied. In the other variant of the
problem, we are given with $\ell$ integers $k_1,k_2, \ldots, k_{\ell}$, the
goal here is to search for $\ell$ many set of slots $S_1, S_2, \ldots,
S_{\ell}$ such that for all $i \in [\ell]$, $|S_{i}| \leq k_i$ and for all $i
\neq j$, $S_i \cap S_j=\emptyset$ and the influence demand of each of the
products gets satisfied. We model the first variant of the problem as a
multi-submodular cover problem and the second variant as its generalization.
For solving the first variant, we adopt the bi-criteria approximation
algorithm, and for the other variant, we propose a sampling-based approximation
algorithm. Extensive experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard
datasets highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution
approach.

Conclusion: 该论文通过分析随机移位分解，提出了一种构建树嵌入和ℓ₁- oblivious路由的算法，这些算法在顺序、并行和分布式设置中均能以最优工作、深度和轮数实现，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: We present a new and surprisingly simple analysis of random-shift
decompositions -- originally proposed by Miller, Peng, and Xu [SPAA'13]: We
show that decompositions for exponentially growing scales $D = 2^0, 2^1,
\ldots, 2^{\log_2(\operatorname{diam}(G))}$, have a tight constant trade-off
between distance-to-center and separation probability on average across the
distance scales -- opposed to a necessary $\Omega(\log n)$ trade-off for a
single scale.
  This almost immediately yields a way to compute a tree $T$ for graph $G$ that
preserves all graph distances with expected $O(\log n)$-stretch. This gives an
alternative proof that obtains tight approximation bounds of the seminal result
by Fakcharoenphol, Rao, and Talwar [STOC'03] matching the $\Omega(\log n)$
lower bound by Bartal [FOCS'96]. Our insights can also be used to refine the
analysis of a simple $\ell_1$-oblivious routing proposed in [FOCS'22], yielding
a tight $O(\log n)$ competitive ratio.
  Our algorithms for constructing tree embeddings and $\ell_1$-oblivious
routings can be implemented in the sequential, parallel, and distributed
settings with optimal work, depth, and rounds, up to polylogarithmic factors.
Previously, fast algorithms with tight guarantees were not known for tree
embeddings in parallel and distributed settings, and for $\ell_1$-oblivious
routings, not even a fast sequential algorithm was known.

Motivation: 边支配和节点支配是计算超图最小命中集时常用的自然规则，研究其合流性有助于理解规则应用的最终结果是否唯一。

Method: 研究两种重写规则（边支配和节点支配）在超图上的应用，通过理论分析证明这些规则的合流性。

Result: 证明了边支配和节点支配规则在超图上是合流的，且在同构意义下存在唯一的最小超图。

Conclusion: 论文证明了在超图上应用边支配和节点支配规则是合流的，即无论应用规则的顺序如何，最终得到的超图在同构意义上是唯一的，从而存在一个唯一的最小超图（在同构意义下）。

Abstract: In this note, we study two rewrite rules on hypergraphs, called
edge-domination and node-domination, and show that they are confluent. These
rules are rather natural and commonly used before computing the minimum hitting
sets of a hypergraph. Intuitively, edge-domination allows us to remove
hyperedges that are supersets of another hyperedge, and node-domination allows
us to remove nodes whose incident hyperedges are a subset of that of another
node. We show that these rules are confluent up to isomorphism, i.e., if we
apply any sequences of edge-domination and node-domination rules, then the
resulting hypergraphs can be made isomorphic via more rule applications. This
in particular implies the existence of a unique minimal hypergraph, up to
isomorphism.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展正则表达式是形式语言理论中的基本概念，也是数据搜索和处理的基本原语。自Hopcroft和Ullmann在1970年代提出动态规划解决方案以来，该问题的改进有限。本文旨在显著提升现有的时间和空间复杂度界限。

Method: 使用了一种新的算法，结合矩阵乘法的最新技术，优化了时间和空间复杂度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的算法，显著改进了扩展正则表达式匹配的时间和空间复杂度，将时间复杂度中的主导项替换为更高效的项，并同时优化了空间复杂度。

Abstract: An extended regular expression $R$ specifies a set of strings formed by
characters from an alphabet combined with concatenation, union, intersection,
complement, and star operators. Given an extended regular expression $R$ and a
string $Q$, the extended regular expression matching problem is to decide if
$Q$ matches any of the strings specified by $R$. Extended regular expressions
are a basic concept in formal language theory and a basic primitive for
searching and processing data. Extended regular expression matching was
introduced by Hopcroft and Ullmann in the 1970s [\textit{Introduction to
Automata Theory, Languages and Computation}, 1979], who gave a simple dynamic
programming solution using $O(n^3m)$ time and $O(n^2m)$ space, where $n$ is the
length of $Q$ and $m$ is the length of $R$. Since then, several solutions have
been proposed, but few significant asymptotic improvements have been obtained.
The current state-of-the art solution, by Yamamoto and Miyazaki~[COCOON, 2003],
uses $O(\frac{n^3k + n^2m}{w} + n + m)$ time and $O(\frac{n^2k + nm}{w} + n +
m)$ space, where $k$ is the number of negation and complement operators in $R$
and $w$ is the number of bits in a word. This roughly replaces the $m$ factor
with $k$ in the dominant terms of both the space and time bounds of the
Hopcroft and Ullmann algorithm.
  We revisit the problem and present a new solution that significantly improves
the previous time and space bounds. Our main result is a new algorithm that
solves extended regular expression matching in \[O\left(n^\omega k +
\frac{n^2m}{\min(w/\log w, \log n)} + m\right)\] time and $O(\frac{n^2 \log
k}{w} + n + m) = O(n^2 +m)$ space, where $\omega \approx 2.3716$ is the
exponent of matrix multiplication. Essentially, this replaces the dominant
$n^3k$ term with $n^\omega k$ in the time bound, while simultaneously improving
the $n^2k$ term in the space to $O(n^2)$.

problem as a special case of the minimax facility location problem. By
considering road network structure and strategic placement of administrative
centers, this method seeks to minimize travel time disparities and ensure a
more balanced distribution of administrative time burden for the population. We
show implementations of this approach in the context of Latvia, a country with
complex geographical features and diverse population distribution.

Conclusion: 本文通过引入新的精确算法和改进的运行时间，解决了稳定割集问题，并针对不同最小度约束的图提供了多项式时间算法和核化算法。此外，还证明了稳定割集在特定最小度约束下的NP完全性，并设计了适用于相同约束的3-着色问题的改进算法。

Abstract: A stable cutset is a set of vertices $S$ of a connected graph, that is
pairwise non-adjacent and when deleting $S$, the graph becomes disconnected.
Determining the existence of a stable cutset in a graph is known to be
NP-complete. In this paper, we introduce a new exact algorithm for Stable
Cutset. By branching on graph configurations and using the $O^*(1.3645)$
algorithm for the (3,2)-Constraint Satisfaction Problem presented by Beigel and
Eppstein, we achieve an improved running time of $O^*(1.2972^n)$.
  In addition, we investigate the Stable Cutset problem for graphs with a bound
on the minimum degree $\delta$. First, we show that if the minimum degree of a
graph $G$ is at least $\frac{2}{3}(n-1)$, then $G$ does not contain a stable
cutset. Furthermore, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for graphs where
$\delta \geq \tfrac{1}{2}n$, and a similar kernelisation algorithm for graphs
where $\delta = \tfrac{1}{2}n - k$.
  Finally, we prove that Stable Cutset remains NP-complete for graphs with
minimum degree $c$, where $c > 1$. We design an exact algorithm for this
problem that runs in $O^*(\lambda^n)$ time, where $\lambda$ is the positive
root of $x^{\delta + 2} - x^{\delta + 1} + 6$. This algorithm can also be
applied to the \textsc{3-Colouring} problem with the same minimum degree
constraint, leading to an improved exact algorithm as well.

Motivation: 由于系统发育多样性和生态约束（如食物网）在生物学中都很重要，但之前的研究大多独立进行，因此本文旨在将两者结合起来考虑。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个新的算法框架，用于解决在食物网依赖关系下最大化系统发育多样性的问题，并提供了完整的参数化复杂度分类。

Abstract: For a phylogenetic tree, the phylogenetic diversity of a set A of taxa is the
total weight of edges on paths to A. Finding small sets of maximal diversity is
crucial for conservation planning, as it indicates where limited resources can
be invested most efficiently. In recent years, efficient algorithms have been
developed to find sets of taxa that maximize phylogenetic diversity either in a
phylogenetic network or in a phylogenetic tree subject to ecological
constraints, such as a food web. However, these aspects have mostly been
studied independently. Since both factors are biologically important, it seems
natural to consider them together. In this paper, we introduce decision
problems where, given a phylogenetic network, a food web, and integers k, and
D, the task is to find a set of k taxa with phylogenetic diversity of at least
D under the maximize all paths measure, while also satisfying viability
conditions within the food web. Here, we consider different definitions of
viability, which all demand that a "sufficient" number of prey species survive
to support surviving predators. We investigate the parameterized complexity of
these problems and present several fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms.
Specifically, we provide a complete complexity dichotomy characterizing which
combinations of parameters - out of the size constraint k, the acceptable
diversity loss D, the scanwidth of the food web, the maximum in-degree in the
network, and the network height h - lead to W[1]-hardness and which admit FPT
algorithms. Our primary methodological contribution is a novel algorithmic
framework for solving phylogenetic diversity problems in networks where
dependencies (such as those from a food web) impose an order, using a color
coding approach.

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the weighted makespan on a single
machine with restarts. Restarts are similar to preemptions but weaker: a job
can be interrupted, but then it has to be run again from the start instead of
resuming at the point of interruption later. The objective is to minimize the
weighted makespan, defined as the maximum weighted completion time of jobs.
  We establish a lower bound of 1.4656 on the competitive ratio achievable by
deterministic online algorithms. For the case where all jobs have identical
processing times, we design and analyze a deterministic online algorithm that
improves the competitive ratio to better than 1.3098. Finally, we prove a lower
bound of 1.2344 for this case.

TL;DR: PolicySmith利用LLM自动生成实例最优策略，在缓存和拥塞控制中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统策略设计依赖人工，效率低且难以适应不同实例。本文旨在通过自动化搜索技术（如LLM）重新构想策略设计。

Method: 提出PolicySmith框架，利用生成模型（特别是LLM驱动的代码生成）自动搜索实例最优的启发式策略。

Result: 在缓存策略中，PolicySmith发现的启发式优于标准基线；在拥塞控制中，生成的策略可直接安全集成到Linux内核。

Conclusion: PolicySmith通过LLM驱动的启发式搜索，成功生成了优于现有基线的缓存策略，并能够直接集成到Linux内核中的安全拥塞控制策略。

Abstract: Policy design for various systems controllers has conventionally been a
manual process, with domain experts carefully tailoring heuristics for the
specific instance in which the policy will be deployed. In this paper, we
re-imagine policy design via a novel automated search technique fueled by
recent advances in generative models, specifically Large Language Model
(LLM)-driven code generation. We outline the design and implementation of
PolicySmith, a framework that applies LLMs to synthesize instance-optimal
heuristics. We apply PolicySmith to two long-standing systems policies - web
caching and congestion control, highlighting the opportunities unraveled by
this LLM-driven heuristic search. For caching, PolicySmith discovers heuristics
that outperform established baselines on standard open-source traces. For
congestion control, we show that PolicySmith can generate safe policies that
integrate directly into the Linux kernel.

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into 5G-Advanced and
future 6G networks presents a transformative opportunity for wireless
connectivity, enabling agile deployment and improved LoS communications.
However, the effective design and optimization of these aerial networks depend
critically on high-quality, empirical data. This paper provides a comprehensive
survey of publicly available wireless datasets collected from an airborne
platform called Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform on Advanced
Wireless (AERPAW). We highlight the unique challenges associated with
generating reproducible aerial wireless datasets, and review the existing
related works in the literature. Subsequently, for each dataset considered, we
explain the hardware and software used, present the dataset format, provide
representative results, and discuss how these datasets can be used to conduct
additional research. The specific aerial wireless datasets presented include
raw I/Q samples from a cellular network over different UAV trajectories,
spectrum measurements at different altitudes, flying 4G base station (BS), a
5G-NSA Ericsson network, a LoRaWAN network, an radio frequency (RF) sensor
network for source localization, wireless propagation data for various
scenarios, and comparison of ray tracing and real-world propagation scenarios.
References to all datasets and post-processing scripts are provided to enable
full reproducibility of the results. Ultimately, we aim to guide the community
toward effective dataset utilization for validating propagation models,
developing machine learning algorithms, and advancing the next generation of
aerial wireless systems.

TL;DR: DePSAC是一种延迟和利润感知的网络切片准入控制方案，通过DRL和Boltzmann探索优化5G网络切片的QoS与利润权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRL框架主要关注利润优化，未明确考虑服务延迟，可能导致QoS违规；且常用的epsilon-greedy探索导致收敛不稳定和策略学习次优。

Method: 提出了一种基于DRL的DePSAC方案，结合延迟感知奖励函数和Boltzmann探索策略。

Result: 实验表明DePSAC在整体利润、减少URLLC切片延迟、提高接受率和资源消耗方面优于DSARA基线。

Conclusion: DePSAC 在5G网络切片场景中有效实现了更好的QoS与利润权衡，验证了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: 5G networks enable diverse services such as eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC through
network slicing, necessitating intelligent admission control and resource
allocation to meet stringent QoS requirements while maximizing Network Service
Provider (NSP) profits. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
frameworks focus primarily on profit optimization without explicitly accounting
for service delay, potentially leading to QoS violations for latency-sensitive
slices. Moreover, commonly used epsilon-greedy exploration of DRL often results
in unstable convergence and suboptimal policy learning. To address these gaps,
we propose DePSAC -- a Delay and Profit-aware Slice Admission Control scheme.
Our DRL-based approach incorporates a delay-aware reward function, where
penalties due to service delay incentivize the prioritization of
latency-critical slices such as URLLC. Additionally, we employ Boltzmann
exploration to achieve smoother and faster convergence. We implement and
evaluate DePSAC on a simulated 5G core network substrate with realistic Network
Slice Request (NSLR) arrival patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method outperforms the DSARA baseline in terms of overall profit, reduced
URLLC slice delays, improved acceptance rates, and improved resource
consumption. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed DePSAC
in achieving better QoS-profit trade-offs for practical 5G network slicing
scenarios.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware approach using crowdsourced data to estimate 5G user throughput, showing bottlenecks shift from RAN to deeper network layers, with E2E metrics becoming more critical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in characterizing application-layer user throughput in next-generation networks, where traditional methods like drive tests and operator equipment counters are costly, limited, or fail to capture E2E Quality of Service (QoS) and its variability.

Method: The paper leverages large-scale crowdsourced measurements, including E2E, radio, contextual, and network deployment features, to propose an uncertainty-aware and explainable approach for downlink user throughput estimation. It uses NGBoost, a model providing both point estimates and calibrated confidence intervals, marking its first application in computer communications.

Result: The results include validating prior 4G methods with an 8.7% improvement in R^2, extending them to 5G NSA and 5G SA, and providing the first benchmarks for 5G crowdsourced datasets. The model also analyzes the evolution from 4G to 5G SA, showing throughput bottlenecks moving from RAN to transport and service layers.

Conclusion: The study concludes that throughput bottlenecks in next-generation networks shift from the Radio Access Network (RAN) to transport and service layers, highlighting the importance of end-to-end (E2E) metrics over radio-related features.

Abstract: Characterizing application-layer user throughput in next-generation networks
is increasingly challenging as the higher capacity of the 5G Radio Access
Network (RAN) shifts connectivity bottlenecks towards deeper parts of the
network. Traditional methods, such as drive tests and operator equipment
counters, are costly, limited, or fail to capture end-to-end (E2E) Quality of
Service (QoS) and its variability. In this work, we leverage large-scale
crowdsourced measurements-including E2E, radio, contextual and network
deployment features collected by the user equipment (UE)-to propose an
uncertainty-aware and explainable approach for downlink user throughput
estimation. We first validate prior 4G methods, improving R^2 by 8.7%, and then
extend them to 5G NSA and 5G SA, providing the first benchmarks for 5G
crowdsourced datasets. To address the variability of throughput, we apply
NGBoost, a model that outputs both point estimates and calibrated confidence
intervals, representing its first use in the field of computer communications.
Finally, we use the proposed model to analyze the evolution from 4G to 5G SA,
and show that throughput bottlenecks move from the RAN to transport and service
layers, as seen by E2E metrics gaining importance over radio-related features.

TL;DR: Maple是一个多智能体系统，通过自然语言输入生成正确的深度学习命令行，解决了异构GPU集群中命令行编写的挑战，准确率达92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在GPU集群上训练深度学习模型时，需要适应异构启动器、调度器、亲和性选项、DL框架参数和环境变量，手动编写命令行容易出错且耗时。

Method: Maple由一个多智能体系统组成，包括信息提取、模板检索、命令行验证和错误纠正四个功能模块。

Result: Maple在567个测试案例中实现了92.0%的命令行生成准确率，性能与GPT-5、Claude和Gemini等最先进模型相当。

Conclusion: Maple展示了在异构高性能计算环境中实现便携和可扩展分布式深度学习的实际价值。

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models across Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
clusters is technically challenging. One aspect is that users have to compose
command lines to adapt to the heterogeneous launchers, schedulers, affinity
options, DL framework arguments, and environment variables. Composing correct
command lines is error-prone and can easily frustrate users, impeding research
or wasting resources. In this work, we present Maple, a multi-agent system that
generates correct DL command lines with users' natural language input. Maple
consists of four agents with the functionalities of information extraction,
template retrieval, command line verification, and error correction. We
evaluate Maple on nine GPU clusters across national computing centers in the
U.S., five representative deep learning model families, and four commonly used
parallel DL training paradigms. Our experiments also cover schedulers of SLURM
and PBS and heterogeneous architectures, such as NVIDIA A100/H200 GPUs and
Intel Max series GPUs. Maple achieves 92.0% accuracy in generating command
lines across the 567 test cases. Leverage multiple language models with an
aggregated size of 10B parameters, Maple delivers comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art models of GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini. Together, these results
highlight Maple's practical value in enabling portable and scalable distributed
DL across heterogeneous HPC environments.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通用的单边算法，支持分布式矩阵乘法中的所有分区和复制因子组合，性能与高度优化的分布式张量库PyTorch DTensor相当。

Abstract: Many important applications across science, data analytics, and AI workloads
depend on distributed matrix multiplication. Prior work has developed a large
array of algorithms suitable for different problem sizes and partitionings
including 1D, 2D, 1.5D, and 2.5D algorithms. A limitation of current work is
that existing algorithms are limited to a subset of partitionings. Multiple
algorithm implementations are required to support the full space of possible
partitionings. If no algorithm implementation is available for a particular set
of partitionings, one or more operands must be redistributed, increasing
communication costs. This paper presents a universal one-sided algorithm for
distributed matrix multiplication that supports all combinations of
partitionings and replication factors. Our algorithm uses slicing (index
arithmetic) to compute the sets of overlapping tiles that must be multiplied
together. This list of local matrix multiplies can then either be executed
directly, or reordered and lowered to an optimized IR to maximize overlap. We
implement our algorithm using a high-level C++-based PGAS programming framework
that performs direct GPU-to-GPU communication using intra-node interconnects.
We evaluate performance for a wide variety of partitionings and replication
factors, finding that our work is competitive with PyTorch DTensor, a highly
optimized distributed tensor library targeting AI models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPC方法在PE上执行控制器时存在操作系统开销导致的抖动和控制带宽限制，而专用片上控制器又面临面积和功耗问题。

Method: 基于算子分裂的二次规划求解器和嵌入式多核RISC-V控制器，采用修剪弱热耦合和提前调度等技术。

Conclusion: 该研究通过硬件-软件协同设计，提出了一种轻量级的MPC控制器，显著降低了延迟并提高了能效，同时保持了较小的内存占用和芯片面积。

Abstract: Managing energy and thermal profiles is critical for many-core HPC processors
with hundreds of application-class processing elements (PEs). Advanced model
predictive control (MPC) delivers state-of-the-art performance but requires
solving an online optimization problem over a thousand times per second (1 kHz
control bandwidth), with computational and memory demands scaling with PE
count. Traditional MPC approaches execute the controller on the PEs, but
operating system overheads create jitter and limit control bandwidth. Running
MPC on dedicated on-chip controllers enables fast, deterministic control but
raises concerns about area and power overhead. In this work, we tackle these
challenges by proposing a hardware-software codesign of a lightweight MPC
controller, based on an operator-splitting quadratic programming solver and an
embedded multi-core RISC-V controller. Key innovations include pruning weak
thermal couplings to reduce model memory and ahead-of-time scheduling for
efficient parallel execution of sparse triangular systems arising from the
optimization problem. The proposed controller achieves sub-millisecond latency
when controlling 144 PEs at 500 MHz, delivering 33x lower latency and 7.9x
higher energy efficiency than a single-core baseline. Operating within a
compact less than 1 MiB memory footprint, it consumes as little as 325 mW while
occupying less than 1.5% of a typical HPC processor's die area.
