TL;DR: 本文提出了一种减少Kaguya TC图像压缩噪声的方法，显著提升了3D月球地图质量，适用于未来月球探索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球月球探索活动的增加，高质量3D月球地图的需求日益迫切，尤其是对于长距离任务，如NASA的Endurance任务概念。Kaguya TC图像虽然全球可用，但存在由立体匹配误差和JPEG压缩伪影引起的高度不准确问题。

Method: 分析了Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别了系统性视差噪声模式，特别是在较暗区域。提出了一种通过减少压缩图像衍生的视差图像中的残余噪声来提升3D地图质量的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法有效减少了高程噪声。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效减少了由压缩引起的噪声，提高了3D月球地图的质量，增强了未来月球任务的地形数据安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768)
*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D框架通过显式建模高斯不确定性，提升了动态3D场景重建在遮挡和极端视角下的稳定性和合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D场景重建在单目输入下存在固有的约束不足问题，导致遮挡和极端视角下的运动漂移和合成质量下降。

Method: 引入了一个新颖的Uncertainty-aware动态高斯溅射框架USplat4D，通过估计随时间变化的高斯不确定性，并利用这些不确定性构建时空图进行优化。

Result: 在多样化的真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性一致性地改进了动态高斯溅射模型。

Conclusion: USplat4D通过显式建模高斯不确定性，显著提升了动态高斯溅射模型的性能，在遮挡下提供更稳定的几何结构，并在极端视角下实现高质量的合成效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

### [3] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP和DINO在相同条件下预训练，CLIP擅长文本任务，DINO擅长视觉任务；语言监督变体效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨CLIP优于自监督模型（如DINO）的优势是源于语言监督还是更大的训练数据。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO，并分析它们的嵌入特性。

Result: CLIP捕捉高层次语义（如对象类别、文本），而DINO对低层次特征（如颜色和风格）更敏感。CLIP在文本密集型VQA任务中表现更好，DINO在视觉中心任务中略优。

Conclusion: CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现优越，而DINO在视觉中心任务中略胜一筹。语言监督的变体带来的增益有限。研究结果为视觉编码器设计及其对VLM性能的影响提供了科学见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

### [4] [MVP4D: Multi-View Portrait Video Diffusion for Animatable 4D Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12785)
*Felix Taubner,Ruihang Zhang,Mathieu Tuli,Sherwin Bahmani,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D模型从单张图像生成多视角视频，提升数字人化身的真实性和一致性，实现实时渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创建和动画化数字人化身的过程昂贵且耗时，现有方法虽降低了门槛，但缺乏多视角信息或显式3D表示，导致视角偏离时质量下降。

Method: 基于预训练的视频扩散模型，生成360度多视角视频帧，并通过蒸馏技术实时渲染4D化身。

Result: MVP4D生成的化身在真实性、时间一致性和3D一致性上优于先前方法，并能实时渲染。

Conclusion: MVP4D模型通过单张参考图像生成多视角视频，显著提升了数字人化身的真实性、时间一致性和3D一致性，并实现了实时渲染。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoDINO 是一种针对乳腺X光摄影的新型自监督学习框架，通过创新的数据增强和对比学习目标，在乳腺癌筛查任务中表现出色，并具有良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习（SSL）在通用领域已经改变了视觉编码器的训练，但在医学影像中由于数据有限和领域特定偏差，仍然未被充分利用。

Method: 引入了乳腺组织感知的数据增强采样器，用于图像级和补丁级监督，以及利用3D数字乳腺断层合成（DBT）结构的跨切片对比学习目标，将3D结构融入2D预训练。

Result: MammoDINO 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务上实现了最先进的性能，并在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MammoDINO 提供了一个可扩展、无需标注的多用途计算机辅助诊断（CAD）工具基础，有助于减轻放射科医生的工作负担并提高乳腺癌筛查的诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

Motivation: 交通视频安全分析需要复杂的视频理解能力，以捕捉细粒度行为模式并生成全面描述用于事故预防。

Method: 采用VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL的双模型框架，通过任务特定优化分离训练字幕生成和视觉问答任务。

Result: VideoLLaMA在时间推理上表现优异（CIDEr得分1.1001），Qwen2.5-VL在视觉理解上表现突出（VQA准确率60.80%）。在2025 AI City Challenge Track 2中，方法S2得分为45.7572，排名第10。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的双模型框架通过任务特定优化显著提升了交通事故预防中的视频理解能力，实验验证了分离训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [7] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net通过结合CNN和TPS变换，从单张全景图像高效估计房间布局，适用于立方体和非立方体布局，实验验证了其高准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间的3D布局在计算机视觉中有广泛应用，如机器人、增强现实和室内设计。

Method: PanoTPS-Net采用两阶段架构：首先通过CNN提取高级特征并学习TPS变换的空间参数，然后通过TPS空间变换层将参考布局变形为预测布局。

Result: 模型在多个公开数据集上表现出色，3DIoU值在PanoContext、Stanford-2D3D、Matterport3DLayout和ZInD数据集上分别为85.49、86.16、81.76和91.98。

Conclusion: PanoTPS-Net展示了在从单张全景图像估计房间布局方面的有效性，特别是在处理立方体和非立方体布局时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

### [8] [Prompt-Guided Spatial Understanding with RGB-D Transformers for Fine-Grained Object Relation Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11996)
*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间推理框架，通过嵌入边界框坐标增强空间理解，在AI City Challenge中排名第四。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模3D环境（如仓库）中的空间推理是视觉语言系统的重大挑战，现有模型依赖局部外观且缺乏明确的空间基础。

Method: 通过将边界框坐标形式的掩码维度直接嵌入输入提示中，增强空间理解，并针对四个问题类别进行微调。

Result: 综合管道在公共排行榜上以73.0606的最终得分排名第四。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境中的空间推理方面是有效的。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [9] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了ViTs在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO与Grad-CAM结合提供最佳解释效果，支持ViTs在医疗诊断中的可靠应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型决策的可理解性直接影响临床信任和采用。尽管ViTs在诊断影像中表现出色，但其复杂的注意力机制对可解释性提出了挑战。

Method: 本研究评估了不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略（ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer）的可解释性，使用了Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM方法。

Result: 研究发现，DINO与Grad-CAM结合提供了最忠实和局部化的解释。Grad-CAM产生类判别和空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在错误分类情况下，DINO与Grad-CAM也能突出显示临床相关的形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，本研究支持了将ViTs可靠且可解释地整合到关键医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APGNet是一种自适应先导网络，结合Siamese架构和先验引导机制，有效解决了水下图像退化和伪装物体检测的挑战，实验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像退化（如低对比度和色彩失真）以及海洋生物的自然伪装给伪装物体检测（COD）带来挑战，现有方法缺乏对水下光学特性的考虑，难以适应水下环境。

Method: APGNet采用多尺度Retinex色彩恢复算法（MSRCR）进行数据增强，设计了扩展感受野模块（ERF）和多尺度渐进解码器（MPD），并提出了自适应先验引导机制，通过空间注意力和可变形卷积融合位置和边界先验。

Result: 在两个公共MAS数据集上的广泛实验表明，APGNet在常用评估指标下优于15种最先进方法。

Conclusion: APGNet通过结合Siamese架构和先验引导机制，显著提升了水下环境中伪装物体的检测准确性和鲁棒性，实验结果证明了其在公共MAS数据集上的优越性能。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

*Adam Tupper,Christian Gagné*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出个性化联邦微调方法，通过正交LoRA适配器解耦知识，提升联邦学习在医疗数据上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医疗领域的应用受到数据共享和聚合的限制，联邦学习可以解决这一问题，但仍需有效的微调方法以提高性能。

Method: 使用正交LoRA适配器进行个性化联邦微调，以解耦通用和客户端特定知识。

Result: 在真实世界联邦医学影像任务上的初步结果显示，该方法在当前联邦微调方法中表现优异。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的个性化联邦微调方法，通过正交LoRA适配器解耦通用和特定客户端知识，使每个客户端能够充分利用自身和其他数据。初步结果表明，该方法在当前联邦微调方法中具有竞争力。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散基编辑方法虽在结构保留任务上表现优异，但在结构可变编辑中存在时间不一致、主体身份漂移等问题，亟需一种新方法解决这些挑战。

Method: VidMP3利用姿势和位置先验从源视频中学习广义运动表示，生成新视频时保持原始运动的同时允许结构和语义的灵活性。

Result: 定性和定量评估均表明VidMP3优于现有方法，成功实现了时间一致性和主体身份保持。

Conclusion: VidMP3通过利用姿势和位置先验学习源视频的广义运动表示，有效解决了现有方法在时间一致性、主体身份漂移和需要人工干预等问题上的不足，展示了在保持原始运动的同时实现结构和语义灵活性的优势。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于扩散变换器（DiT）的框架和训练无关方法（Mask-CFG）在多角色音频驱动动画中表现出色，实现了高质量、时间一致且高效的视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

Motivation: QR码去模糊任务需确保解码成功，现有深度学习方法未充分利用QR码的结构化边缘先验。

Method: 设计了Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB)嵌入显式边缘先验到Transformer架构中，基于EGAB开发了EG-Restormer，并针对轻度模糊设计了LENet，最终整合为Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet)。

Result: EG-Restormer和ADNet在严重和轻度模糊QR码上均表现优异，解码率和速度均达到领先水平。

Conclusion: 提出的EG-Restormer和ADNet在QR码去模糊任务中表现出色，尤其在解码成功率和速度上达到领先水平，适合资源受限的移动设备。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Method: 提出利用平面结构的普遍性来获取精确的度量尺度深度图，并在生成流程中引入几何指导，以改进可见性掩模估计、新视角选择和视频扩散模型的多视角一致性。

Conclusion: 本文的方法在几何和外观重建方面均优于现有基线，特别是在未观察区域。此外，该方法支持单视图输入和非姿态视频，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CIL中模型复杂度高、表示迁移不平滑及阶段优化与全局推理不一致的三大难题。

Method: 提出了DRL框架，包括IPA网络（轻量级适配器）和DAS（解耦锚监督），以平滑表示迁移并减少阶段间不一致。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，DRL始终优于其他最先进方法，且训练和推理效率高。

Conclusion: DRL框架通过IPA网络和DAS设计，有效解决了CIL中的三大挑战，显著提升了性能并保持了高效性。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

Motivation: 老照片面部修复面临多重退化问题（如破损、褪色、严重模糊），现有方法在处理局部伪影或面部颜色时存在困难。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型生成的伪参考面部，结合面部解析图和划痕掩码，进行分阶段监督：结构引导应用于整个去噪过程，色彩细化在后期步骤中进行。

Result: SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面表现优异，并通过VintageFace基准测试验证了其效果。

Conclusion: SSDiff方法在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有的基于GAN和扩散的方法，并通过VintageFace基准测试验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

Conclusion: ImageSentinel是一种有效保护视觉数据集在RAIG系统中免受未经授权使用的新框架，同时保持了授权应用的生成质量。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中表现优异，但受限于硬件条件（如系统带宽、最大激光功率等），压缩直方图虽能缓解数据速率问题，但在实际照明硬件约束下表现不佳。

Method: 使用梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，确保其符合硬件约束条件。

Result: 通过广泛仿真验证，提出的编码函数在带宽和峰值功率约束下均优于传统设计，尤其在峰值功率受限系统中优势显著。该方法还能适应任意参数化的脉冲响应。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种受限优化方法，用于设计实用的压缩单光子3D成像编码函数，通过梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，显著提升了在带宽和峰值功率约束下的性能。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为多模态研究提供了强大且经济高效的视觉字幕解决方案，有望推动未来研究。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，KFF方法在ImageNet-C数据集上相比其他方法表现出更高的效果，验证了其适应性和知识动态积累的优势。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的实验表明，DPL显著提升了一次性医学图像分割的性能。

Conclusion: DPL通过扩散原型学习框架显著提升了一次性医学图像分割的性能，成为该领域的新标杆。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Motivation: 全监督3D实例分割方法需要密集点级标注，成本高；现有基于框标注的方法在重叠区域存在模糊性，且两阶段训练流程复杂。

Method: 采用学生-教师框架，教师模型通过指数移动平均更新，引入实例中心查询优化和两种新损失函数（查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失）。

Conclusion: BEEP3D在ScanNetV2和S3DIS数据集上表现出色，性能与最先进的弱监督方法相当或更优，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining

Motivation: 现有的知识蒸馏方法难以有效将教师MLLM的丰富视觉感知能力传递给学生，这一问题在以往研究中被忽视。研究发现视觉注意力不对齐是主要原因。

Method: 提出CompoDistill，一种新颖的知识蒸馏框架，通过明确对齐学生和教师的视觉注意力来增强学生的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Motivation: 当前的端到端自动驾驶模型在分布外（OOD）场景中表现不佳，COOOL基准和2COOOL挑战旨在填补这一空白，鼓励超越封闭分类的危险理解。

Method: 提出了一个分层推理框架，结合帧级标注、事故帧检测和视觉语言模型（VLMs）的细粒度推理。通过模型集成和盲A/B评分选择协议提高了事实准确性和可读性。

Conclusion: 分层推理结合视觉语言模型（VLMs）是事故分析和更广泛理解安全关键交通事件的有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Motivation: 模仿学习（IL）在端到端自动驾驶模型中泛化能力差，而强化学习（RL）存在样本效率低和收敛不稳定的问题。结合两者可以互补优势。

Method: 提出了CoIRL-AD，一种竞争性双策略框架，允许IL和RL代理在训练期间交互，通过竞争机制促进知识交换并避免梯度冲突。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验显示，碰撞率降低了18%，泛化能力和长尾场景性能均有提升。

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架通过结合模仿学习（IL）和强化学习（RL），在自动驾驶领域显著提升了性能，减少了碰撞率，并增强了泛化能力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

TL;DR: DIANet是一种双流框架，通过相位感知动态图像和跨注意力融合提升微表情识别性能，实验证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别因面部线索的细微和短暂性及标注数据有限而具有挑战性，传统动态图像方法忽略了微表达中不同时间相位的特性。

Method: 提出了一种双流框架DIANet，利用相位感知动态图像（一个编码onset-to-apex相位，另一个捕获apex-to-offset相位），并通过跨注意力融合模块自适应整合两流特征。

Result: 在三个基准MER数据集（CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW）上的实验表明，DIANet优于传统单相位动态图像方法。

Conclusion: DIANet通过显式建模时间相位信息，显著提升了微表情识别的性能，为MER领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过无监督的两阶段证据损失聚类和残差流匹配机制，显著提升了在噪声标签下的开放集领域泛化性能，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究提出了改进的视觉语言（VL）推理数据集构建策略，并通过HoneyBee数据集展示了其有效性，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通过迭代细化采样标记的自校正图像生成方法，结合了并行标记预测的效率优势，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于时空一致性代理节点的视频表示方法，能够有效解决传统视频表示中因像素级匹配和跟踪带来的不稳定问题，支持复杂的视频处理任务。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

Motivation: 医学图像常因隐私、伦理和标注成本高而数据稀缺，现有损失函数（如交叉熵和Dice损失的加法组合）对超参数敏感且表现不佳。

Method: 通过乘法结合交叉熵和Dice损失，动态调整梯度，并引入置信度驱动的指数缩放机制，强化对困难样本的学习。

Conclusion: 提出的两种新型损失函数（乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失）在医学和细胞图像分割中表现出色，尤其在数据稀缺的情况下，提供了简单、有效且无需超参数调整的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法通过利用本地背景特征作为伪OOD特征，有效缓解了神经网络在OOD数据上的过度自信问题，并在多个标准OOD检测基准上取得了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Conclusion: AngularFuse在多个公开数据集上表现优于现有主流方法，尤其在挑战性场景中能生成更清晰、更详细的结果，展示了卓越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

TL;DR: PAGS通过语义优先级优化3D重建，显著提升保真度和效率，特别是在安全关键对象上，同时大幅加速渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间存在明显权衡，主要原因是其语义无关的设计。PAGS旨在通过任务感知的语义优先级来解决这一问题。

Method: PAGS框架包括两个核心贡献：（1）语义引导的修剪和正则化策略，通过混合重要性度量简化非关键场景元素；（2）优先级驱动的渲染管道，利用优先级深度预传递来加速最终着色计算。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的实验表明，PAGS在安全关键对象上实现了卓越的重建质量，同时将渲染速度提升至超过350 FPS。

Conclusion: PAGS通过引入任务感知的语义优先级，显著提高了3D重建的保真度和计算效率，特别是在安全关键对象上表现优异，同时大幅降低了训练时间并提升了渲染速度。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

TL;DR: 论文提出DL-DKD++框架，通过动态知识蒸馏解决部分相关视频检索任务，在多个数据集上取得最优效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际中视频通常未经修剪且内容复杂的问题，提出部分相关视频检索（PRVR）任务。

Method: 采用双学习框架结合动态知识蒸馏（DL-DKD++），从大规模视觉语言预训练模型中提取泛化知识，并迁移到轻量级的PRVR网络中。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的DL-DKD++框架在PRVR任务上取得了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究VLMs在logo幻觉中的表现，尤其是模型生成与视觉证据无关的品牌名称或文本内容的现象。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和带有文本的logo数据集，以及Hard-60子集，系统测量VLMs的幻觉现象，并通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性。嵌入层面分析采用开源权重LLaVA。

Result: 幻觉现象在强失真下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最明显的弱点。嵌入分析显示幻觉与投影器的一小部分维度相关，针对性消融能减少错误并保持OCR准确性。

Conclusion: VLMs的幻觉问题与投影器子空间密切相关，通过针对性消融和OCR引导的解码可以显著减少错误，为构建更可靠的多模态系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Result: 在公开测试排行榜上，该方案的聚合得分为0.432，排名第二。

Conclusion: Qualcomm AI Research的解决方案在RealADSim-NVS挑战中获得了第二名，展示了其在街景新视角合成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place

TL;DR: CurriFlow是一种新的语义占用预测框架，结合光流对齐和课程深度融合，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义场景补全方法依赖时间堆叠或深度投影，缺乏明确的运动推理，且在遮挡和噪声深度监督下表现不佳。

Method: CurriFlow 采用多级融合策略，利用预训练的光流对齐分割、视觉和深度特征，同时通过课程学习机制逐步从稀疏但准确的LiDAR深度过渡到密集但噪声较多的立体深度。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试中，CurriFlow的平均IoU达到16.9，验证了其运动引导和课程感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: CurriFlow 通过结合光流的时间对齐和课程引导的深度融合，在相机基础的3D语义场景补全中实现了最先进的性能，平均IoU为16.9。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Method: 采用注意力引导的采样模块，克服了传统子采样不可微的问题，并实现了输入自适应。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的可学习子采样框架，通过动态调整输入适应性，显著提升了深度神经网络模型的性能并降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单帧物体状态检测，忽略了时间特征，导致在物体部分遮挡时准确性和鲁棒性受限。

Method: 提出了双流框架STORM-PSR，包括组装状态检测流和时空流，后者结合空间编码器和基于Transformer的时间编码器。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上，平均延迟分别降低了11.2%和26.1%。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR通过结合空间和时间特征，显著提高了程序步骤识别的准确性和鲁棒性，尤其在部分遮挡情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 场景坐标回归（SCR）模型在3D视觉中被证明是强大的隐式场景表示，但若训练图像缺乏多视图约束，SCR模型会退化。我们希望通过融入高层重建先验来改善这一情况。

Method: 我们提出了一种训练场景坐标回归（SCR）模型的概率重新解释，允许融入高层重建先验。我们研究了多种先验，从简单的重建深度值分布先验到学习到的合理场景坐标配置先验。对于后者，我们在大量室内扫描数据上训练了一个3D点云扩散模型。

Result: 我们的先验在训练过程中将预测的3D场景点推向合理几何，提高了它们的似然性。

Conclusion: 在三个室内数据集上，我们的先验知识帮助学习到了更好的场景表示，产生了更连贯的场景点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机姿态，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Method: 采用PRISMA方法论，分析了2021年至2025年间发表的32项同行评审研究。

Conclusion: VLMs展现出了在城市监测任务中的巨大潜力，特别是在零样本应用方面，但仍需进一步研究以优化其性能和实用性。

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

Motivation: 低场磁共振成像（LF-MRI）虽然经济便携，但信噪比低且诊断质量差，需要一种无需昂贵基础设施即可提升图像质量的方法。

Method: 通过条件流匹配（CFM）直接回归最优速度场，学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流。

Result: CFM不仅实现了最先进的性能，还能稳健地泛化到分布内和分布外数据，同时参数数量显著少于竞争性深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM框架作为一种强大且可扩展的工具，在MRI重建中展现出巨大潜力，特别是在资源有限的临床环境中。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Conclusion: VideoLucy通过深度记忆回溯框架有效解决了长视频理解中的时间上下文和关键信息保留问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越GPT-4o等专有模型。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Conclusion: 本文总结了当前纵向放射学报告生成（LRRG）研究的五大主要局限性，并提出了未来发展的有前景方向，旨在为这一新兴领域的进步奠定基础。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Conclusion: MS-GAGA框架通过两阶段设计，显著提升了对抗样本在黑盒设置下的可转移性和视觉不可感知性，相比现有攻击方法，在未见过的检测器上实现了高达27%的错误分类率提升。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过早期融合框架和轻量级生成器，成功解决了多模态学习中数据增强导致的文本与图像空间对齐问题，并在三个医学影像任务和四个分割框架中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

TL;DR: BSGS通过两阶段优化和动态策略，解决了运动模糊图像3D重建的挑战，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS去模糊方法因依赖精确相机姿态和无法有效控制高斯基元错误密集化而性能受限。

Method: BSGS包含相机姿态粗略优化和全局刚性变换两阶段，并采用子帧梯度聚合策略和时空双阶段优化策略。

Result: 综合实验验证了BSGS的有效性，并展示了其优于现有技术的性能。

Conclusion: Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting (BSGS)有效地解决了从运动模糊图像中重建高质量3D场景的挑战，通过两阶段优化和动态调整策略，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

TL;DR: VAD是一种轻量级、无网络的方法，通过Voronoi辅助扩散直接从点云计算UDF，解决了神经方法的不足，适用于多种几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在学习UDF时存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性差的问题，需要一种更高效稳定的替代方案。

Method: 采用Voronoi辅助扩散技术，通过双向法线分配和能量函数优化对齐，扩散形成近似UDF梯度场，最后积分得到UDF。

Result: 实验表明，VAD能够稳健处理封闭和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非定向几何结构，同时保持计算高效和稳定。

Conclusion: VAD方法通过Voronoi辅助扩散技术，直接从无定向点云计算UDF，有效解决了现有神经方法在数值稳定性、计算成本和可控性方面的限制。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Motivation: 尽管现有方法（如VAEs、GANs和扩散模型）依赖过参数化输入特征和辅助损失，但这些策略对扩散模型并非必要。本文旨在证明仅需基本调整即可匹配人体运动分布。

Method: 采用分数扩散模型，结合特征空间归一化和解析权重调整的标准L2分数匹配损失，直接生成运动和形状。

Result: 在无条件人体运动生成任务中达到与最先进方法相当的效果，且避免了后处理步骤。

Conclusion: 通过理论驱动的组件设计和针对性消融实验，验证了所提方法的有效性，证明了简单调整在扩散模型中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMOT是首个无人机多光谱多目标跟踪基准测试，提出多光谱和方向感知的跟踪方案，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无人机视角下的目标小、遮挡严重和背景复杂，现有的RGB跟踪算法依赖的空间外观线索（如颜色和纹理）在航空视角下性能下降，因此需要利用多光谱图像提供的像素级光谱反射率来增强目标区分能力。

Method: 提出了一种多光谱和方向感知的多目标跟踪方案，包括轻量级Spectral 3D-Stem整合光谱特征、方向感知的卡尔曼滤波器用于精确状态估计，以及端到端的方向自适应变换器。

Result: 实验表明，多光谱输入显著提升了多目标跟踪性能，特别是在小目标和密集场景下。

Conclusion: MMOT基准测试和提出的多光谱、方向感知的多目标跟踪方案显著提升了无人机在多目标跟踪中的性能，特别是在小目标和密集场景下。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖交叉注意力机制融合条件与运动，但难以保持逐步时间对齐。

Method: 通过将条件信息集成到Mamba块的递归动力学中，实现了更好的时间对齐运动。

Result: 在多种人体运动任务上的实验表明，该模型在时间对齐性、运动真实性和条件一致性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于Mamba的新模型Temporally Conditional Mamba，显著提升了时间对齐性、运动真实性和条件一致性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业图像分割中标注数据稀缺和复杂田间条件对监督方法的限制。

Method: 利用Plantnet的专业植物表示识别植物区域并生成粗分割掩码，再通过SAM细化以产生详细分割。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础模型在IoU指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型与专业植物中心模型可以缓解标注瓶颈，并在多样化农业场景中实现有效分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种无需外部监督的扩散模型正则化方法，通过自监督利用模型中间表示提升训练效率和生成质量，适用于多种领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型研究表明，外部指导可以加速训练，但需要额外的监督或数据。LayerSync旨在通过模型自身的中间表示来实现这一目标，减少对外部资源的依赖。

Method: 通过利用扩散模型自身中间表示的语义丰富性，LayerSync设计了一种自监督的正则化方法，无需外部指导即可加速训练并提升生成质量。

Result: 在图像生成任务中，LayerSync将基于流的Transformer在ImageNet数据集上的训练速度提升了8.75倍，生成质量提高了23.6%，并在音频、视频和运动生成等其他领域展示了广泛适用性。

Conclusion: LayerSync作为一种自给自足的即插即用正则化方法，无需外部监督或额外数据，显著提升了扩散模型的生成质量和训练效率，并展示了跨领域的适用性。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，导致标注成本高和推理延迟大，IVT-LR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR)方法，通过潜在文本和潜在视觉信息的结合来表示推理步骤，并采用渐进式多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上，IVT-LR平均准确率提升5.45%，推理速度提升5倍以上。

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法通过潜在空间的多模态推理，显著提升了推理效率和准确性，同时减少了人工标注的需求。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Motivation: 像素空间生成模型在训练难度和性能上普遍落后于潜在空间模型，存在持续的效率和性能差距。

Method: 首先预训练编码器以捕捉干净图像的语义，并将其与确定性采样轨迹上的点对齐；然后与随机初始化解码器集成，进行端到端的微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上，扩散模型FID达2.04，ImageNet-512达2.35（75 NFE）；一致性模型在单步采样中FID为8.82，显著超越潜在空间模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出的两阶段训练框架成功缩小了像素空间生成模型与潜在空间模型之间的性能差距，尤其在ImageNet数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法通过跨频率一致性损失和超轻量网络，显著提升了零样本去噪的计算效率和去噪性能，适用于复杂噪声特性的真实世界场景。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在处理用户提供的非完美图像时，缺乏动态视觉推理能力，需要从‘静态视觉感知’转向‘可操作的认知工作空间’。

Method: 引入IRIS基准测试，包含1,204个开放式的视觉任务，涵盖五个领域，并采用详细评分标准进行系统评估。

Result: 当前MLLMs表现不佳，最强模型（GPT-5-think）通过率仅18.68%，且不同模型在图像操作工具的使用上表现差异显著。

Conclusion: IRIS基准测试揭示了当前MLLMs在动态视觉推理任务中的局限性，为未来视觉智能的发展提供了关键方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有HMR方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器，计算成本高，而分层VFMs的中间阶段特征图分辨率与非分层模型相当或更高，因此探索其早期阶段的潜力。

Method: 通过构建三种轻量级HMR2.0变体，并利用分层VFMs（如Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer和VMamba）的早期阶段作为编码器，设计了一种高效的HMR和HPE模型。

Result: 对27种基于分层VFMs的HMR和HPE模型进行全面评估，发现仅使用前两或三个阶段即可达到与完整阶段模型相当的性能，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 使用分层视觉基础模型（VFMs）的早期阶段作为编码器，能够实现与完整阶段模型相当的性能，同时在准确性和计算效率之间提供更好的权衡。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Conclusion: TerraCodec (TEC) 系列算法为地球观测数据提供了定制化的学习压缩方案，显著提升了压缩效率，并展示了在零样本云修复等任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准在评估深层语义理解方面存在不足，尤其是在复杂领域如视觉艺术分析中，问题过于简单，无法全面评估模型的视觉推理能力。

Method: 通过多智能体协作管道构建VQArt-Bench，生成多样化、经过验证的复杂问题，评估模型在符号意义、叙事和复杂视觉关系等多维度的理解能力。

Result: 对14种先进MLLMs的评估显示，当前模型在简单计数任务中表现不佳，且开源模型与专有模型之间存在明显性能差距。

Conclusion: 目前的多模态大语言模型在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域仍存在显著局限性，尤其是在深层语义理解和视觉推理方面。VQArt-Bench的提出揭示了当前模型的不足，并为未来研究提供了新的评估方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新型多无人机协作占用预测框架，通过整合空间感知特征编码器和跨代理特征集成，有效保留了3D空间结构和语义信息。实验结果表明，该方法在显著降低通信开销的同时，达到了最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

TL;DR: UniFusion是一种基于扩散的生成模型，利用冻结的VLM作为统一编码器，通过LAP和VERIFI方法实现跨模态知识迁移和高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成模型依赖独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了跨模态推理和知识迁移的能力。UniFusion旨在通过统一的编码器设计解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Layerwise Attention Pooling（LAP）机制从冻结的VLM中提取多层级信息，并结合VERIFI方法在推理时利用VLM的文本令牌进行条件生成。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐和视觉信息传递方面优于其他浅层融合架构，VERIFI进一步提升了推理能力和灵活性。模型在单图像编辑任务上微调后，能零样本泛化到多图像参考任务。

Conclusion: UniFusion通过Layerwise Attention Pooling（LAP）机制和VERIFI方法，成功实现了跨模态知识迁移和文本-图像对齐，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

TL;DR: CuMPerLay 是一种可微分向量化层，通过简化 CMP 的向量化过程，成功将其集成到深度学习中，提升了图像分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP 虽然在图像拓扑处理中具有强大潜力，但其应用受到多过滤结构复杂性和向量化困难的阻碍。

Method: CuMPerLay 是一种新颖的可微分向量化层，通过将 CMP 分解为可学习的单参数持久性组合，并联合学习双过滤函数。

Result: 实验证明 CuMPerLay 在医学影像和计算机视觉数据集上提升了分类和分割性能，尤其在数据有限的情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay 提供了一种有前景的方法，将全局结构信息集成到深度网络中，用于结构化图像分析。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型因监督信号稀疏而导致的表示能力未充分利用的问题。

Method: 提出了DriveVLA-W0训练范式，采用世界建模预测未来图像，生成密集的自监督信号，并针对两种VLA架构（自回归世界模型和扩散世界模型）进行了实例化。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准和更大的内部数据集上，DriveVLA-W0显著优于BEV和VLA基线模型。

Conclusion: DriveVLA-W0通过世界建模任务显著提升了VLA模型的性能，特别是在大规模数据集上表现优异，加速了数据缩放定律的效果。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在真实世界视频超分辨率中面临的高延迟、高计算成本和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出了FlashVSR框架，包含三阶段蒸馏管道、局部约束稀疏注意力和微小条件解码器，并构建了VSR-120K数据集。

Result: FlashVSR在A100 GPU上实现了约17 FPS的处理速度，性能优于现有的一步扩散VSR模型，速度提升高达12倍。

Conclusion: FlashVSR通过结合三种创新技术实现了高效、可扩展且实时的视频超分辨率处理，并在超高分辨率下表现优异，为未来基于扩散模型的VSR研究提供了宝贵的资源。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Method: SPORTS框架采用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征，结合姿态、深度和光流模态，优化特征图。VO部分利用VPS的泛光分割结果和光流图提升动态物体置信度估计，进而提高相机姿态估计和深度图生成的准确性。SR部分则利用VO的点云数据生成神经场，合成高保真RGB和泛光视图。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过整合VPS、VO和SR任务，显著提升了场景理解的全面性和准确性，实验证明其在多个任务上优于现有方法。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在无监督条件下因缺乏鲁棒数据关联而导致的病态问题，避免显式变分正则化带来的偏差和计算开销，以及参数化方法易陷入局部最优的缺陷。

Method: 提出了一种无监督框架，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化自运动和光流。方法包括将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，并通过微分几何约束融入结构和运动先验。

Result: 实验表明E-MoFlow在6-DoF运动场景中具有通用性，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow框架通过隐式正则化在无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，在6-DoF运动场景中表现优异，甚至与有监督方法竞争。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Motivation: 头部运动在脑 PET 成像中会导致图像伪影和示踪剂摄取定量不准确，影响神经疾病的精确诊断。硬件运动跟踪在临床实践中应用受限，因此需要一种更有效的数据驱动解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于深度学习的头部运动校正方法 DL-HMC++，利用交叉注意力机制从一秒的 3D PET 原始数据中预测刚性头部运动。该方法通过监督学习训练，利用已有的动态 PET 扫描数据和外部硬件运动跟踪的金标准运动测量。

Result: DL-HMC++ 在两种 PET 扫描仪和四种示踪剂上表现优于现有数据驱动运动估计方法，生成的图像清晰、伪影减少，与金标准硬件运动跟踪结果接近。标准摄取值分析显示平均差异比在 HRRT 和 mCT 上分别为 1.2±0.5% 和 0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++ 展示了数据驱动的 PET 头部运动校正的潜力，能够消除对硬件运动跟踪的依赖，使运动校正技术更广泛地应用于临床环境。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient

efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常只能密集采样单一场景动态实现，而FPT旨在提供多模态场景运动及其依赖物理交互和动态不确定性的直接表示。

Method: Flow Poke Transformer (FPT) 是一种新颖的框架，通过稀疏交互（“pokes”）直接预测局部运动的分布。

Result: FPT在密集面部运动生成中超越专用基线模型，在铰接物体运动估计任务中显著优于域内方法，并在移动部件分割等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FPT提供了一种可解释且直接可访问的多模态场景运动表示方法，显著提高了在多种任务中的性能表现，包括密集面部运动生成和铰接物体运动估计。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

TL;DR: SRUM框架通过自我奖励机制，利用UMMs的理解模块提升生成能力，显著改善了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UMMs在视觉理解和生成能力之间存在显著差距，研究旨在探索模型是否可以通过理解模块奖励生成模块实现自我提升。

Method: SRUM是一种自我奖励的后训练框架，通过设计全局-局部双奖励系统，利用模型的理解模块作为内部“评估器”，为生成模块提供多尺度指导。

Result: SRUM在T2I-CompBench和T2I-ReasonBench上的性能分别从82.18提升至88.37和从43.82提升至46.75。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入SRUM框架，为统一多模态模型（UMMs）建立了一种自我奖励的新范式，利用模型的理解模块来指导和增强其生成能力，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

TL;DR: ViCO通过动态调整视觉令牌数量，显著降低MLLMs推理成本，保持性能。代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs因图像输入引入的额外视觉令牌导致推理成本增加，需解决此问题以提高效率。

Method: 提出Visual Consistency Learning（ViCO）训练算法，使用多个不同压缩比的MLP连接器，根据图像语义复杂度动态调整视觉令牌数量。训练时最小化不同MLP连接器响应的KL散度，推理时通过Visual Resolution Router（ViR）自动选择压缩率。

Result: 实验表明，ViCO方法可将视觉令牌数量减少高达50%，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ViCO方法通过动态调整视觉令牌数量，显著降低了MLLMs的推理成本，同时保持了模型的感知、推理和OCR能力。代码和模型的发布将促进未来研究。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一种3B规模的MLLM，通过量化坐标、数据引擎和两阶段训练，在目标检测中实现了SOTA性能，并支持多种语言任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标回归模型在目标检测中存在局限性，如低召回率、重复预测和坐标不对齐问题。Rex-Omni旨在通过MLLM解决这些问题。

Method: 1) 任务设计：使用特殊令牌表示量化坐标；2) 数据引擎：生成高质量数据；3) 训练流程：两阶段训练，结合监督微调和GRPO强化学习。

Result: Rex-Omni在COCO和LVIS等基准测试中实现了与或超越回归模型的零样本性能，并支持多种语言理解任务。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni 提出了一种新型的3B规模MLLM，通过特殊的任务设计、数据引擎和训练流程，显著提升了目标检测的性能，并在多种基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

Motivation: 解决现有检索增强生成方法在动态信息检索中的不足，如流程僵化、搜索调用过多和查询构建不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。引入DeepMMSearchVQA数据集，包含多样化的多跳查询，整合文本和视觉信息。

Conclusion: DeepMMSearch-R1通过两阶段训练流程和创新的数据集，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在动态信息检索中的表现，为多模态网络搜索领域提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

Motivation: 当前虚拟现实中3D内容物理操纵技术存在工程密集型过程和简化几何表示的局限性，影响了视觉保真度和物理准确性。

Method: 通过直接整合对象的网格与Gaussian Splatting表示，开发了一种物理引擎无关的系统，支持高保真度的3D内容交互和变形。

Result: 在18名参与者参与的对比用户研究中，该方法在物理感知拉伸操作中表现显著优于现有技术，并在扭转和摇晃等其他物理操作中表现更一致。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的Gaussian Splatting方法在虚拟现实环境中实现了更精确的表面近似和高度真实的变形与交互，显著优于现有技术，并展示了其作为现有方法可行替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and
efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for
physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face
significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes
and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can
compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
\our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual
\textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a
novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an
object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach
enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic
deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{}
facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow.
Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting
developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers
a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D
manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current
state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study
involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is
statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation
and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting
and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms
that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing
its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

TL;DR: Coordinate Condensation是一种改进的坐标下降法，通过独立求解局部和子空间位移消除阻尼，实现高效并行且接近牛顿法的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如JGS2）虽然通过扰动子空间增强局部求解以考虑全局耦合，但引入了阻尼效应，可能降低收敛速度。

Method: 该方法结合了Schur补子空间校正的坐标下降法，独立求解局部和子空间位移。

Result: 实验表明，在子空间能充分捕捉全局耦合的问题中，该方法比标准坐标下降法和JGS2收敛更快。

Conclusion: Coordinate Condensation通过独立求解局部和子空间位移，消除了阻尼效应，实现了接近牛顿法的收敛速度，同时保持了坐标下降法的效率和并行性。

Abstract: We introduce Coordinate Condensation, a variant of coordinate descent that
accelerates physics-based simulation by augmenting local coordinate updates
with a Schur-complement-based subspace correction. Recent work by Lan et al.
2025 (JGS2) uses perturbation subspaces to augment local solves to account for
global coupling, but their approach introduces damping that can degrade
convergence. We reuse this subspace but solve for local and subspace
displacements independently, eliminating this damping. For problems where the
subspace adequately captures global coupling, our method achieves near-Newton
convergence while retaining the efficiency and parallelism of coordinate
descent. Through experiments across varying material stiffnesses and mesh
resolutions, we show substantially faster convergence than both standard
coordinate descent and JGS2. We also characterize when subspace-based
coordinate methods succeed or fail, offering insights for future solver design.

Conclusion: LLM4GTA通过保留表示间隙作为几何必要性，有效维护了模态特定知识并提升了迁移性能，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates
structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in
diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to
maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and
text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical
analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction
result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge
structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric
incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological
patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment
compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure
collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding.
We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves
representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific
knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap
preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity
evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative
power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show
significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有草图学习方法对有效信息的利用不足，限制了性能。本文旨在系统地识别并利用草图中的有效信息。

Method: 提出了Multi-Level Sketch Representation Scheme，将草图表示分为三个层次（草图级、笔画级、点级），并设计了SDGraph架构，包含Sparse Graph和Dense Graph两个互补模块，通过图卷积和上下采样操作实现编码与解码。

Result: SDGraph在分类和检索任务中分别提升了1.15%和1.70%的准确率，在矢量草图生成质量上提升了36.58%。

Conclusion: SDGraph通过多级表示方案和双图架构，显著提升了草图相关任务的性能，包括分类、检索和矢量草图生成。

Abstract: Freehand sketches exhibit unique sparsity and abstraction, necessitating
learning pipelines distinct from those designed for images. For sketch learning
methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information
embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes
effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of
existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level
Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective
information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels:
sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the
granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine
(point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch
information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental
evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the
above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to
exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph
comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as
nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense
Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level
representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with
down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both
encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two
graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of
sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\% and
1.70\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively,
and 36.58\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个可复现的AI框架，深入探讨了启发式方法在部分信息下的有效性，并开源了代码，从而推动了AI研究并支持了文化游戏的数字保存。

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新颖的回归框架，通过直接建模验证器偏差，显著提高了评估的准确性。在代码反馈任务中，该方法将最大绝对误差降至1.2%，优于现有最佳集成方法。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆的传感器存在视野受限的问题，车辆间通信（如CAM）可以弥补这一不足，提高情境感知能力。

Method: 设计并训练了一个名为CAMNet的图神经网络，基于CAM数据进行车辆轨迹预测。

Result: CAMNet在运动预测数据集上表现出色，证明了CAM数据在车辆轨迹预测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文展示了CAM数据在车辆轨迹预测中的潜力，同时也指出了方法的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限用户历史下生成跨领域有效顺序澄清问题的挑战，以个性化LLM响应。

Method: 采用两阶段过程，受扩散模型启发：前向过程生成澄清问题并逐步移除答案以添加“噪声”；反向过程训练模型通过提出有效问题来“去噪”。

Result: 结果显示，该方法显著提升了LLM提出引导性问题和获取用户偏好的效率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了大型语言模型在提出引导性问题及有效获取用户偏好方面的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

Conclusion: CausalTrace在工业环境中展示了高精度和可靠性，能够提供透明的决策支持，与领域专家达成高度一致，并通过了C3AN框架的全面评估。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码契约遵守性的框架，填补了现有基准测试的不足，通过测试套件和新型指标提升了代码的健壮性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试主要评估功能正确性，忽视了契约遵守性这一关键方面，导致无法生成真正健壮可靠的代码片段。

Method: PACT通过扩展HumanEval+和MBPP+，引入了一个专注于契约违反的测试套件，并分析了不同提示条件下代码生成的系统性表现。

Result: PACT通过引入契约违反测试用例显著提升了模型对契约的遵守能力，并提供了新的量化指标来严格评估契约遵守性。

Conclusion: PACT提供了一个全面的框架，用于评估和增强LLM生成的代码片段在功能正确性和契约遵守性方面的表现，填补了现有基准测试的不足。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文、泛化能力差且可解释性有限，而LLM虽具备少样本泛化能力但受限于文本且忽视地理信息。

Method: 通过GAL将大型语言模型（LLM）与结构化地理数据结合，自动检索并整合基础设施、人口、地形和天气等信息，生成感知脚本以支持资源分配决策。

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估表明，地理空间接地的代理模型优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的地理空间感知层（GAL）框架能够有效提升灾害响应能力，且可推广至洪水、飓风等其他灾害类型。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在推理效率低和偏离目标的问题，当前无训练方法要么过于僵化，要么缺乏可操作性。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes，这些指令由推理行为分类驱动，以引导模型达到更优表现。

Result: 实验显示ThinkPilot显著改善了推理的准确性与长度的权衡，大幅提升安全性（如将StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），并增强了指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: ThinkPilot通过自动生成和优化think-prefixes，显著提升了大型推理模型的性能和安全性，并展示了与现有训练方法的协同效应。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

Conclusion: 论文提出，优化推理模型的关键在于时间而非模型规模，并指出在无限资源和时间下，大模型可能成为‘专家’但缺乏智能。

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验评估表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景中对多个人口统计属性实现了竞争性表现。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj框架通过利用LLMs的零样本学习和语义理解能力，无需标记训练数据即可进行人口统计推断，解决了标记数据稀缺性问题，并在零样本场景中实现了竞争性表现。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: EmboMatrix作为首个训练场，成功提升了LLM在具身决策任务中的表现，证明了基于环境交互学习的重要性。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

Method: BeSTAD采用行为聚类感知的建模机制，结合空间上下文和时间动态联合建模，学习语义丰富的移动表示，并通过跨时期行为比较识别异常。

Result: BeSTAD能够捕捉个体化行为特征，检测细微的移动行为偏差，并在大规模移动数据集中识别表现出此类变化的个体。

Conclusion: BeSTAD通过无监督学习框架，实现了对大规模人口数据中个体化移动行为异常的检测，推动了异常检测向个性化和可解释性移动分析的发展。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

Result: LLMs能生成具有一定随机性的输出，但其表现不一致，且常显著偏离预期行为。

Conclusion: LLMs在涉及随机性的任务中表现不一致，且与预期行为存在显著偏差，需改进其处理随机性的能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

TL;DR: MatSciBench 是一个材料科学领域的综合基准，用于评估 LLMs 的科学推理能力，结果显示现有模型表现不佳，且不同推理策略各有优劣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在科学推理方面表现出色，但其在材料科学领域的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入了 MatSciBench，一个包含 1,340 个问题的综合性大学水平基准，覆盖材料科学的子学科，并采用结构化分类和难度分级。评估了不同推理策略（基础链式思维、工具增强和自我纠正）的表现。

Result: 评估显示，即使是表现最佳的模型 Gemini-2.5-Pro，在大学水平材料科学问题上的准确率也低于 80%。不同推理策略在不同场景下表现不一。

Conclusion: MatSciBench 建立了一个全面且坚实的基准，用于评估和推动大型语言模型（LLMs）在材料科学领域的科学推理能力的改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live

fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，需开发既高效又可理解的智能系统，现有评估过程过于技术化，未充分关注人类用户需求。

Method: 对65项评估XAI系统的用户研究进行综合分析，区分XAI系统特性与评估指标。

Result: 区分XAI核心系统与解释部分，评估指标分为情感、认知、可用性等类别，针对AI新手和数据专家提出不同设计目标。

Conclusion: 本文为XAI开发者提供了以人为中心的评估和设计框架扩展，强调根据用户AI专业知识水平调整设计目标。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

TL;DR: GOAT是一种无需人工标注的训练框架，通过自动合成数据集提升LLM代理在目标导向任务中的性能，实验证明其在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理需要分解高级目标为多个相互依赖API调用的目标导向查询时能力有限，且缺乏训练数据，主要依赖零样本评估。开源模型在复杂工具使用方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种名为GOAT的新型训练框架，该框架无需人工标注，直接从API文档自动构建目标导向API执行任务的合成数据集，使模型能够推理相互依赖的调用并生成连贯响应。

Result: 实验表明，经过GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，并在新引入的GOATBench基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT框架为构建具有复杂推理和工具使用能力的开源LLM代理提供了一条实用路径，通过自动合成数据集和微调，显著提升了模型在目标导向任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法捕捉动态、上下文敏感的医疗对话复杂性，且忽略了患者信息需求的演变。

Method: 提出了基于结构化医学知识图谱的多轮评估框架MedKGEval，包括知识图谱驱动的患者模拟机制、即时轮级评估框架和多轮基准测试。

Result: MedKGEval成功构建了一个多轮基准测试，展示了其在识别LLMs行为缺陷和安全风险方面的能力。

Conclusion: MedKGEval框架能够有效识别传统评估方法忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险，适用于多语言和特定领域的扩展。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在跨领域部署时面临领域适应性问题，传统手动提示工程效率低且依赖专家知识，现有自动化方法缺乏动态策略和精细粒度调整能力。

Method: 提出PromptFlow框架，结合元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器模块，采用梯度元学习和强化学习方法实现动态提示优化和经验回收。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验验证了PromptFlow的有效性，能够以最小任务特定数据需求自主探索最优提示优化路径。

Conclusion: PromptFlow作为一种模块化训练框架，通过梯度元学习和强化学习方法有效解决了自动化提示工程中的动态策略选择和经验回收问题，显著提升了LLM在多样化NLP任务中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在主动推理任务中常因信念偏差导致性能下降，需要一种方法来控制这种偏差以提升训练效率和最终性能。

Method: 论文提出了$\mathbf{T^3}$方法，该方法通过跟踪模型信念偏差，在训练过程中截断无效轨迹，保留有信息的前缀。

Result: 在5个具有挑战性的任务中，$\mathbf{T^3}$方法显著提升了训练稳定性、令牌效率和最终性能，最高提升30%，同时减少了约25%的令牌使用。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为$\mathbf{T^3}$的方法，通过检测和截断训练过程中的信念偏差轨迹，显著提升了LLM在主动推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

Result: 展示了如何在张量逻辑中优雅地实现神经、符号和统计AI的关键形式，包括变换器、形式推理、核机器和图形模型。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑通过统一神经和符号AI，提供了一个潜在的解决方案，以促进AI的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

Conclusion: RAG-Anything 提出了一个统一的多模态知识检索框架，解决了现有 RAG 框架仅处理文本内容的局限性，显著提升了多模态文档的处理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

Method: 提出了LLM+CAS框架和O-Forge工具，通过上下文符号反馈循环将LLM与CAS（如Mathematica）结合，用于建议和验证域分解。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架通过结合前沿大型语言模型和计算机代数系统，成功验证了其在研究级渐近不等式证明中的有效性，为专业数学家提供了新的AI辅助工具。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Motivation: 探索Vibe Coding这一新兴范式的有效性，填补其在实际应用中生产力损失和人机协作挑战的研究空白。

Method: 通过分析1000多篇研究论文，调查整个Vibe Coding生态系统，包括LLM编码、基于LLM的编码代理、开发环境和反馈机制。研究还通过约束马尔可夫决策过程形式化Vibe Coding，并总结了五种开发模型。

Result: 首次全面系统地综述了Vibe Coding，建立了理论框架和实践分类，揭示了成功的关键因素。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in

depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PricingLogic是首个测试LLMs在旅游定价中可靠性的基准，结果显示当前LLMs在复杂定价任务中仍不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将这一易出错的任务交由AI系统处理，但未经验证可靠性的LLMs部署可能导致重大财务损失并削弱客户信任。

Method: PricingLogic包含300个基于真实世界定价政策的自然语言问题，涵盖两个难度级别：基本客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 对一系列LLMs的评估显示，在更难的层级上性能急剧下降，暴露出规则解释和算术推理的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）具备通用能力，但在没有进一步保障或领域适应的情况下，当前LLMs在收入关键应用中仍不可靠。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

*Dingyi Zuo,Hongjie Zhang,Jie Ou,Chaosheng Feng,Shuwan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MTOS是一个整合多主题与LLMs的社会模拟框架，通过实验证明其能更真实地模拟意见动态变化，改善解释性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多聚焦于单一主题，缺乏对多主题、跨领域认知转移的捕捉；传统数值模型将复杂语言态度简化为离散值，缺乏解释性和行为一致性。

Method: MTOS框架结合LLMs、短期和长期记忆、多种用户选择交互机制、动态主题选择策略以及信念衰减机制，实现跨主题的视角更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制该效应，无关主题通过资源竞争也减弱回音室效应。LLM-based代理能真实模拟动态意见变化并再现新闻文本的语言特征。

Conclusion: MTOS框架通过整合多主题上下文与LLMs，显著改善了模拟的解释性和系统稳定性，能够更真实地模拟动态意见变化和复杂的人类推理。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合偏置注意力机制的DRL框架，用于无信号交叉口的自动驾驶决策，通过风险预测和密集奖励提升了安全性和效率。仿真验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口的自动驾驶决策因复杂的动态交互和高冲突风险而极具挑战性，本文旨在通过智能决策框架实现主动安全控制。

Method: 本文采用Soft Actor-Critic（SAC）算法，结合偏置注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，评估车辆进入交叉口的长期碰撞风险，并将风险转化为密集奖励信号以指导SAC智能体做出安全高效的驾驶决策。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在交叉口场景中显著提升了交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于深度强化学习（DRL）和偏置注意力机制的决策框架，在无信号交叉口场景中有效提升了交通效率和车辆安全性，证明了该智能决策框架在复杂场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM作为评判时的偏见问题，发现现有模型对偏见输入有一定鲁棒性，但微调可能引入风险，并提出了四种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）被用于自主评估通信系统中内容的质量，但其评判的公正性无法保证，任何偏见都可能影响结果并损害用户信任。

Method: 系统研究了两种LLM-as-a-judge模型（GPT-Judge和JudgeLM）在点式评分设置下的11种偏见类型。

Result: 研究发现，最先进的LLM评判对偏见输入表现出鲁棒性，通常为偏见样本分配较低的分数。提供详细的评分标准可以进一步增强这种鲁棒性。微调LLM可能会导致性能显著下降，而评判分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: 论文提出了四种潜在的缓解策略，以确保在实际通信场景中AI评判的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于DAG的任务导向型医疗对话框架，通过系统化流程和自适应机制优化信息收集与报告生成，初步评估显示低认知负荷、高可用性和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在设计一种任务导向型对话框架，通过DAG结构优化医疗信息的收集和报告生成，减少临床工作中的认知负担并提高效率。

Method: 1. 将医疗算法和指南转化为临床问题库的系统化流程；2. 基于层次聚类的冷启动机制；3. 支持自适应分支和回溯的扩展-剪枝机制；4. 确保信息收集充分的终止逻辑；5. 自动化生成符合临床工作流的医生友好型结构化报告。

Result: 患者应用表现出低认知负荷（NASA-TLX=15.6）、高可用性（SUS=86）和高满意度（QUIS=8.1/9）；医生应用显示中等认知负荷（NASA-TLX=26）和极佳可用性（SUS=88.5），满意度为8.3/9。两者均有效融入临床工作流。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的任务导向型对话框架通过DAG结构有效整合了医疗算法和指南，实现了高效的临床信息收集和报告生成，同时在初步评估中展现了低认知负荷、高可用性和用户满意度。尽管存在系统延迟和小样本评估的局限性，但整体证明了其在临床工作流中的实用性和潜力。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要局限于单一数据集和设置，跨实验室和平台的迁移能力有限，数据分割存在泄漏和覆盖偏差问题，且剂量、时间和组合效应尚未系统处理。

Method: 采用测量、提升/投影以实现跨尺度耦合，以及干预用于剂量和调度的操作符语法。

Result: 提出了一个决策对齐的评估蓝图，涵盖模态、尺度、上下文和干预，并推荐操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄漏的分区以及透明的校准和报告。

Conclusion: 提出了一种模型无关的Cell-State Latent（CSL）视角，通过操作符语法组织学习，并强调决策对齐的评估蓝图，以促进可重复和同类比较。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

Motivation: 用户生成评论的激增强调了对可解释模型的需求，现有原型模型通常粒度较粗且无法处理多标签分类。ProtoSiTex旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ProtoSiTex采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，以及监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。通过分层损失函数增强可解释性和对齐性。

Result: 在酒店评论数据集和两个公共基准测试上，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，并提供了忠实且与人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex被证明是一种强大的半可解释多标签文本分类解决方案，能够提供忠实且与人类对齐的解释，同时在性能上达到最先进水平。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

TL;DR: HardcoreLogic 是一个挑战性基准，通过系统变换谜题测试 LRMs 的逻辑推理能力，揭示了模型依赖记忆而非真正推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语料库主要关注如 9x9 数独等流行谜题，可能导致模型过度拟合标准格式和记忆解题模式，掩盖其在理解新规则或适应新变体方面的不足。

Method: 通过引入 HardcoreLogic，一个包含 10 种游戏、超过 5,000 个谜题的挑战性基准，系统地通过增加复杂性（IC）、不常见元素（UE）和不可解谜题（UP）三个维度来测试 LRMs 的鲁棒性。

Result: 对多种 LRMs 的评估显示，即使是在现有基准上表现最佳的模型，其性能也显著下降，表明模型严重依赖记忆的刻板模式。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic 揭示了当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在高级逻辑推理方面的局限性，并建立了一个新的基准以推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Result: 联合优化任务推理和内存管理不仅减少计算消耗，还提升任务性能。

Conclusion: 将工作记忆管理作为可学习的内在能力，通过Memory-as-Action框架和Dynamic Context Policy Optimization算法，不仅能减少计算消耗，还能提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高性能系统依赖大规模模型，部署成本高，而较小的视觉语言模型缺乏必要的知识和技能。ERA旨在通过整合先验知识学习和在线强化学习来弥补这一差距。

Method: ERA框架分为两个阶段：首先是通过‘具身先验学习’从三类数据中提取基础知识，包括轨迹增强先验、环境锚定先验和外部知识先验；其次是开发了一个在线强化学习流程，结合了自总结、密集奖励塑造和轮级策略优化等关键技术设计。

Result: ERA-3B在高级规划任务（EB-ALFRED）和低级控制任务（EB-Manipulation）上分别实现了8.4%和19.4%的改进，超越了基于提示的大模型和之前的训练基线，并展现出对未见任务的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ERA提供了一个实用的路径，朝着可扩展的具身智能发展，并为未来的具身AI系统提供了方法论见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）作为法官的自动化评估方法过于依赖简单聚合（如多数投票），可能导致错误判断，即使单个智能体提供了正确答案。

Method: 提出了一种基于时间变化的Beta-Binomial混合模型的稳定性检测机制，并采用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验作为自适应停止准则。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个多智能体辩论法官框架，通过协作推理和迭代优化响应，显著提高了判断准确性，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法通过自监督学习和图论技术，显著提高了AI系统在无标签数据下的OOD检测能力，增强了系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =

*Myles Foley,Sergio Maffeis,Muhammad Fakhrur Rozi,Takeshi Takahashi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLUTCH 是一种新型深度组合 Bandit 方法，显著提升 JavaScript 模糊测试效率，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 JavaScript 模糊测试技术采用随机选择突变目标，效果有限，因此探索更适合的组合 Bandit 方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的深度组合 Bandit 方法 CLUTCH，结合注意力机制和 Concrete Dropout 动态调整探索策略。

Result: CLUTCH 在有效测试用例数量和覆盖率上分别提升 20.3% 和 8.9%，在组合和动态环境中优于现有 Bandit 方法。

Conclusion: CLUTCH 在 JavaScript 模糊测试中表现出更高的效率，显著提升了有效测试用例的数量和覆盖率。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

*Micah Carroll,Adeline Foote,Kevin Feng,Marcus Williams,Anca Dragan,W. Bradley Knox,Smitha Milli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec利用LLM实现自然语言控制的推荐系统，提升用户满意度和控制感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户对推荐系统的不满源于缺乏细粒度控制，LLM通过自然语言请求提供解决方案。

Method: 提出CTRL-Rec方法，利用LLM模拟用户对推荐项目的批准判断，训练嵌入模型以近似这些判断，并将其整合到传统推荐系统的信号加权中。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上，CTRL-Rec实现了多样请求的细粒度控制；用户研究表明，该方法显著提升了用户控制感和满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法通过自然语言控制显著提升了用户对推荐系统的满意度和控制感，实验证明其在MovieLens数据集上有效且用户反馈积极。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ax-Prover是一个多智能体定理证明系统，通过结合LLMs和Lean工具，实现了跨领域科学问题的自动化证明，并在新基准测试中超越现有系统，同时展示了与人类专家的协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决科学问题解决中需要创造性推理和严格语法严谨的挑战，Ax-Prover旨在开发一个能够在多样化科学领域中自主或与人类专家协作工作的自动化定理证明系统。

Method: Ax-Prover通过将大型语言模型（LLMs）与Lean工具结合，利用模型上下文协议（MCP）确保形式正确性，实现了既需要创造性推理又要求严格语法严谨的科学问题解决。

Result: 在公共数据集上，Ax-Prover与最先进的证明器竞争，而在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准测试中，它显著超越了这些系统。此外，Ax-Prover还成功协助专家数学家形式化了一个复杂密码学定理的证明。

Conclusion: Ax-Prover作为一种基于工具的多智能体定理证明系统，不仅在公共数学基准测试中与最先进的证明器竞争，还在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准测试中显著超越它们，展示了其在多样化科学领域中的通用验证方法。此外，它还通过协助专家数学家形式化复杂密码学定理的证明，体现了其协作能力。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: eye2vec利用分布式表示法简化开发者眼动数据分析，支持多样化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统眼动分析需要预先选择分析目标并手动开发方法，耗时且结果受AOI定义影响。

Method: 将连续的眼动注视点表示为语法元素之间的转换，并采用分布式表示法。

Result: eye2vec提供了更灵活、语义丰富的眼动数据分析框架。

Conclusion: eye2vec通过分布式表示法简化了开发者眼动数据的分析，支持多样化的数据分析方法。

Abstract: This paper presents eye2vec, an infrastructure for analyzing software
developers' eye movements while reading source code. In common eye-tracking
studies in program comprehension, researchers must preselect analysis targets
such as control flow or syntactic elements, and then develop analysis methods
to extract appropriate metrics from the fixation for source code. Here,
researchers can define various levels of AOIs like words, lines, or code
blocks, and the difference leads to different results. Moreover, the
interpretation of fixation for word/line can vary across the purposes of the
analyses. Hence, the eye-tracking analysis is a difficult task that depends on
the time-consuming manual work of the researchers. eye2vec represents
continuous two fixations as transitions between syntactic elements using
distributed representations. The distributed representation facilitates the
adoption of diverse data analysis methods with rich semantic interpretations.

TL;DR: 本文提出将LLM的token预算视为注意力预算，强调任务感知的文本缩减作为数据系统的设计原则，以解决高噪声数据输入的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的文本数据（如日志、遥测和监控流）具有高容量、冗长和噪声的特点，直接输入LLM不仅成本高、环境不可持续，且与任务目标不一致。

Method: 提出将输入侧缩减视为注意力分配而非压缩，设计任务相关的文本缩减策略，并构建自适应缩减流程。

Result: 提出了将token预算作为注意力预算的新视角，并探讨了构建基准、设计自适应缩减流程及集成到数据库和检索系统的开放研究挑战。

Conclusion: 本文主张将LLM的token预算视为注意力预算，并将任务感知的文本缩减作为语言数据系统的首要设计原则，以实现可扩展、准确且可持续的LLM与数据集成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive
workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the
effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and
noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring
streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally
unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in
LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but
the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In
this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention
budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design
principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as
compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most
relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building
benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating
token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our
vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in
noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable
LLM--data integration.

TL;DR: Lingxi是一个利用历史问题修复数据提取程序性知识的框架，显著提升了仓库级问题解决能力，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理的方法在解决复杂仓库级问题时存在两个关键限制：缺乏程序性知识和依赖大量计算能力进行盲目探索。

Method: Lingxi框架首先通过分层抽象机制离线构建程序性知识，使代理能够学习修复的步骤和原理。在线应用时，采用知识驱动的扩展方法，利用类似问题的程序性知识从多个角度智能分析目标问题。

Result: Lingxi在SWE-bench Verified基准测试中的Past@1设置下解决了74.6%的错误，性能显著优于现有技术（5.4%至14.9%）。

Conclusion: Lingxi框架通过利用历史问题修复数据中提取的程序性知识，显著提升了解决仓库级问题的能力，成功解决了SWE-bench Verified基准中74.6%的错误，优于现有五种最先进技术。

Abstract: Driven by the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-powered
agents are making significant improvements in software engineering tasks, yet
struggle with complex, repository-level issue resolution. Existing agent-based
methods have two key limitations. First, they lack of procedural knowledge
(i.e., how an issue is fixed step-by-step and rationales behind it) to learn
and leverage for issue resolution. Second, they rely on massive computational
power to blindly explore the solution space. % To address those limitations, we
propose Lingxi, an issue resolution framework that leverages procedural
knowledge extracted from historical issue-fixing data to guide agents in
solving repository-level issues. \ourTool first constructs this knowledge
offline through a hierarchical abstraction mechanism, enabling agents to learn
the how and why behind a fix, not just the final solution. During online
application, it employs a knowledge-driven scaling method that leverages the
procedural knowledge of similar issues to intelligently analyze the target
issue from multiple perspectives, in sharp contrast to undirected, brute-force
exploration. % Lingxi successfully resolves 74.6\% of bugs on the SWE-bench
Verified benchmark in Past@1 setting, outperforming five state-of-the-art
techniques by a significant margin (5.4\% to 14.9\%). Our comprehensive
ablation study confirmed that the success of Lingxi comes directly from its use
of procedural knowledge. Without it, the performance gains from scaling alone
is negligible. Our qualitative study further shows that the ``design patterns
$\&$ coding practices'' is the most critical knowledge aspect, and that the
roles of different knowledge aspects switch across different stages (i.e.,
analysis, planning, and fixing).

TL;DR: 研究证明，通过版本历史和调用图等上下文信息增强代码表示，能显著提升神经模型在代码克隆检测和代码摘要任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的深度学习模型主要依赖源代码本身，忽略了如版本历史和结构关系等上下文信息，这限制了其理解代码演变和操作的能力。

Method: 对五种代表性模型（CodeBERT、GraphCodeBERT、CodeT5、PLBART、ASTNN）在仅代码和上下文增强设置下进行了微调，并在两个下游任务（代码克隆检测和代码摘要）上评估了性能。

Result: 上下文普遍提升了模型性能：版本历史持续提升了克隆检测（如CodeT5 F1提升15.92%）和代码摘要（如GraphCodeBERT METEOR提升5.56%），而调用图的效果因模型和任务而异。结合多种上下文信息带来了进一步的性能提升（最高达21.48% macro-F1）。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，上下文信息（如版本历史和调用图）能显著提升代码理解的性能，尤其是在代码克隆检测和代码摘要任务中。这为优化神经软件工程模型中的上下文编码提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated program comprehension underpins many software engineering tasks,
from code summarisation to clone detection. Recent deep learning models achieve
strong results but typically rely on source code alone, overlooking contextual
information such as version history or structural relationships. This limits
their ability to capture how code evolves and operates. We conduct an empirical
study on how enriching code representations with such contextual signals
affects neural model performance on key comprehension tasks. Two downstream
tasks, code clone detection and code summarisation, are evaluated using SeSaMe
(1,679 Java methods) and CodeSearchNet (63,259 methods). Five representative
models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, ASTNN) are fine-tuned under
code-only and context-augmented settings. Results show that context generally
improves performance: version history consistently boosts clone detection
(e.g., CodeT5 +15.92% F1) and summarisation (e.g., GraphCodeBERT +5.56%
METEOR), while call-graph effects vary by model and task. Combining multiple
contexts yields further gains (up to +21.48% macro-F1). Human evaluation on 100
Java snippets confirms that context-augmented summaries are significantly
preferred for Accuracy and Content Adequacy (p <= 0.026; |delta| up to 0.55).
These findings highlight the potential of contextual signals to enhance code
comprehension and open new directions for optimising contextual encoding in
neural SE models.

Motivation: 当前的多代理LLM系统在软件工程任务中常因缺乏SE结构化原则而失败，如规范不足、协调错位和不恰当的验证。SEMAP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 论文提出了SEMAP协议，该方法基于三个核心SE设计原则：明确的行为契约建模、结构化消息传递以及生命周期引导的执行与验证。该方法在Google的A2A基础设施上实现。

Result: 实验评估表明，SEMAP在代码开发中最高减少69.6%的功能级开发故障和56.7%的部署级开发故障；在漏洞检测中，Python任务故障减少47.4%，C/C++任务减少28.2%。

Conclusion: SEMAP协议通过引入明确的SE设计原则，显著减少了多代理LLM系统中的故障率，提高了软件工程任务的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: The increasing demand for software development has driven interest in
automating software engineering (SE) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs).
Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate
collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three
core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and
inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE
structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent
Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE
design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract
modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with
verification, and is implemented atop Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A)
infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure
Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures
across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6%
reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for
deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces
failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.

Motivation: 云环境中性能基准测试结果常因高变异性而受质疑，研究旨在量化这种变异性的实际影响并探索其模式。

Method: 通过在不同时间段（数月内）重复执行流处理应用基准测试，量化性能变异性。

Result: 性能变异性在应用层面可观测，但程度较轻；研究发现每日和每周性能模式，并探讨了全球事件的影响。

Conclusion: 研究发现，云环境中性能变异性确实存在，但影响程度低于普遍预期。此外，大规模研究揭示了微妙的每日和每周性能模式，并进一步探讨了全球性事件（如‘黑色星期五’）对性能基准测试的影响。

Abstract: Benchmarks and performance experiments are frequently conducted in cloud
environments. However, their results are often treated with caution, as the
presumed high variability of performance in the cloud raises concerns about
reproducibility and credibility. In a recent study, we empirically quantified
the impact of this variability on benchmarking results by repeatedly executing
a stream processing application benchmark at different times of the day over
several months. Our analysis confirms that performance variability is indeed
observable at the application level, although it is less pronounced than often
assumed. The larger scale of our study compared to related work allowed us to
identify subtle daily and weekly performance patterns. We now extend this
investigation by examining whether a major global event, such as Black Friday,
affects the outcomes of performance benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前自动化安全代码审查方法存在精度和覆盖率不足的问题，缺乏全面评估。

Method: 基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的混合提示架构，结合动态提示管道和有效路由算法。

Result: iCodeReviewer在安全问题和定位方面有效，F1为63.98%，审查意见接受率达84%。

Conclusion: iCodeReviewer在安全代码审查中表现出色，F1得分为63.98%，且生成的审查意见在部署环境中接受率高达84%。

Abstract: Code review is an essential process to ensure the quality of software that
identifies potential software issues at an early stage of software development.
Among all software issues, security issues are the most important to identify,
as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions.
Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the
manual efforts required in the secure code review process. Despite the
progress, current automated approaches on secure code review, including static
analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the
challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive
evaluation.
  To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automated
secure code review approach based on large language models (LLMs).
iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-prompts architecture that
incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage of security issues.
Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a
specific security issue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing
algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features
in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM
hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of iCodeReviewer in security issue identification and
localization with an F1 of 63.98%. The review comments generated by
iCodeReviewer also achieve a high acceptance rate up to 84% when it is deployed
in production environments.

Motivation: 探索软件开发者认知过程（如决策、行为）的研究方法，尤其是口头化技术的应用及其在SE与心理学交叉领域的作用。

Method: 采用大型语言模型（GPT）辅助筛选管道，对9000多篇论文标题进行相关性评估，并与人工评审结果对比验证。

Result: 研究发现SE领域的研究主题多与工程实践相关，人本主题较少；LLM辅助筛选与人工评审的一致性高达87%，分歧率为13%。

Conclusion: 论文总结了软件工程中口头化技术的研究现状，发现SE常借鉴心理学方法，但反向应用较少。同时，LLM在跨学科综述中表现出高效性，与人工评审一致性高。

Abstract: Understanding how software developers think, make decisions, and behave
remains a key challenge in software engineering (SE). Verbalization techniques
(methods that capture spoken or written thought processes) offer a lightweight
and accessible way to study these cognitive aspects. This paper presents a
scoping review of research at the intersection of SE and psychology (PSY),
focusing on the use of verbal data. To make large-scale interdisciplinary
reviews feasible, we employed a large language model (LLM)-assisted screening
pipeline using GPT to assess the relevance of over 9,000 papers based solely on
titles. We addressed two questions: what themes emerge from
verbalization-related work in SE, and how effective are LLMs in supporting
interdisciplinary review processes? We validated GPT's outputs against human
reviewers and found high consistency, with a 13\% disagreement rate. Prominent
themes mainly were tied to the craft of SE, while more human-centered topics
were underrepresented. The data also suggests that SE frequently draws on PSY
methods, whereas the reverse is rare.

Motivation: 研究新兴的Vibe Coding（VC）范式，探讨其与传统编程方法的差异及其对软件开发实践的影响。

Method: 通过五次半结构化访谈，与十位经验丰富的软件从业者探讨了VC范式的五个主题维度。

Result: VC范式通过模糊专业与非开发者之间的界限，实现了新颖的表达形式和快速原型设计，但也带来了可重复性、可扩展性和包容性方面的挑战。

Conclusion: VC范式代表了编程文化的重要转变，值得在HCI和软件工程研究中进一步探讨。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI),
particularly large language models, have introduced new possibilities for
software development practices. In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe
Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and
improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon
the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from
conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like
GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten
experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions:
creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and
criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting,
contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted
development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring
boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel
forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges
regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC
represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further
investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering
research.

Conclusion: 本文通过SysMLv2开发了DarTwin DSL，展示了其在数字孪生（DT）演化管理中的应用潜力，同时也指出了当前SysMLv2工具在图形表示能力上的局限性。

Abstract: The new SysMLv2 adds mechanisms for the built-in specification of
domain-specific concepts and language extensions. This feature promises to
facilitate the creation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and interfacing
with existing system descriptions and technical designs. In this paper, we
review these features and evaluate SysMLv2's capabilities using concrete use
cases. We develop DarTwin DSL, a DSL that formalizes the existing DarTwin
notation for Digital Twin (DT) evolution, through SysMLv2, thereby supposedly
enabling the wide application of DarTwin's evolution templates using any
SysMLv2 tool. We demonstrate DarTwin DSL, but also point out limitations in the
currently available tooling of SysMLv2 in terms of graphical notation
capabilities. This work contributes to the growing field of Model-Driven
Engineering (MDE) for DTs and combines it with the release of SysMLv2, thus
integrating a systematic approach with DT evolution management in systems
engineering.

*Evgeniy Glukhov,Michele Conti,Egor Bogomolov,Yaroslav Golubev,Alexander Bezzubov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Diff-XYZ 是一个用于代码差异理解的紧凑基准测试，包含三个任务，研究发现不同格式适用于不同场景和模型大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的代码差异处理对于大规模编辑和重构代码库的智能代理至关重要。

Method: Diff-XYZ 基准测试包含三个监督任务：应用（旧代码 + 差异 → 新代码）、反应用（新代码 - 差异 → 旧代码）和差异生成（新代码 - 旧代码 → 差异）。数据集来自 CommitPackFT 的真实提交，并配有自动指标和清晰的评估协议。

Result: 研究发现，不同格式应根据使用场景和模型大小选择。例如，搜索替换格式适用于差异生成场景中的大型模型，但不适合差异分析和小型模型。

Conclusion: Diff-XYZ 基准测试为评估和改进大语言模型中的代码差异处理提供了可重复使用的基础，有助于未来差异格式和代码编辑模型的发展。

Abstract: Reliable handling of code diffs is central to agents that edit and refactor
repositories at scale. We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff
understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code $+$ diff
$\rightarrow$ new code), anti-apply (new code $-$ diff $\rightarrow$ old code),
and diff generation (new code $-$ old code $\rightarrow$ diff). Instances in
the benchmark are triples $\langle \textit{old code}, \textit{new code},
\textit{diff} \rangle$ drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with
automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a
focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format
comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that
different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For
example, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models
in the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and
smaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing
and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff
formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub:

*Hashini Gunatilake,John Grundy,Rashina Hoda,Ingo Mueller*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究填补了软件工程领域缺乏专门共情量表的空白，开发了两个经过验证的量表，为评估和提升共情提供了工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管共情在软件工程中被视为关键的人类因素，但缺乏专门针对该领域独特社会技术背景的验证工具。现有通用共情量表在语言、场景和假设上不适合软件从业者，无法准确捕捉该领域多样化的共情表达。

Method: 采用了严格的多阶段方法，包括专家评估、认知访谈和两次从业者调查，以开发和验证量表。

Result: 成功开发了两个量表：EmpathiSEr-P评估从业者间的共情，EmpathiSEr-U评估从业者对用户的共情，涵盖认知共情、情感共情和共情反应三个维度。

Conclusion: 本研究开发并验证了两个领域特定的共情量表：EmpathiSEr-P和EmpathiSEr-U，为软件工程领域提供了首个心理测量学验证的共情评估工具，有助于研究和实践中的共情评估及干预设计。

Abstract: Empathy plays a critical role in software engineering (SE), influencing
collaboration, communication, and user-centred design. Although SE research has
increasingly recognised empathy as a key human aspect, there remains no
validated instrument specifically designed to measure it within the unique
socio-technical contexts of SE. Existing generic empathy scales, while
well-established in psychology and healthcare, often rely on language,
scenarios, and assumptions that are not meaningful or interpretable for
software practitioners. These scales fail to account for the diverse,
role-specific, and domain-bound expressions of empathy in SE, such as
understanding a non-technical user's frustrations or another practitioner's
technical constraints, which differ substantially from empathy in clinical or
everyday contexts. To address this gap, we developed and validated two
domain-specific empathy scales: EmpathiSEr-P, assessing empathy among
practitioners, and EmpathiSEr-U, capturing practitioner empathy towards users.
Grounded in a practitioner-informed conceptual framework, the scales encompass
three dimensions of empathy: cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and empathic
responses. We followed a rigorous, multi-phase methodology, including expert
evaluation, cognitive interviews, and two practitioner surveys. The resulting
instruments represent the first psychometrically validated empathy scales
tailored to SE, offering researchers and practitioners a tool for assessing
empathy and designing empathy-enhancing interventions in software teams and
user interactions.

TL;DR: 本文评估了简化能源和碳模型在实际网站交互中的准确性，发现恒定功率近似与实际能耗存在系统性偏差，强调需要更精细的模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管简化能源和碳模型（如Digst框架和DIMPACT模型）在可持续性报告中广泛采用，但其准确性和精确性仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在评估这些模型在反映实际能耗方面的表现。

Method: 本文通过实证研究评估了丹麦数字政府机构的Digst框架和英国DIMPACT模型等简化能源和碳模型在实际用户交互中的准确性。研究测量了购物、预订、导航和新闻服务在不同笔记本电脑平台上的能耗，使用预定义的用户流程。

Result: 研究结果显示，恒定功率近似（P * t）与实际能耗存在显著差异，具体取决于网站类别、设备类型和任务特性。这些偏差是系统性的而非随机的。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，常用的恒定功率近似（P * t）可能与实际测量的能耗存在显著差异，具体取决于网站类别、设备类型和任务特性。这些偏差是系统性的而非随机的，强调了在可重复的可持续性报告框架中需要类别感知和设备反映的功率参数。

Abstract: Sustainability reporting in web-based services increasingly relies on
simplified energy and carbon models such as the Danish Agency of Digital
Government's Digst framework and the United Kingdom-based DIMPACT model.
Although these models are widely adopted, their accuracy and precision remain
underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study evaluating how well such
models reflect actual energy consumption during realistic user interactions
with common website categories. Energy use was measured across shopping,
booking, navigation, and news services using predefined user flows executed on
four laptop platforms. The results show that the commonly applied
constant-power approximation (P * t) can diverge substantially from measured
energy, depending on website category, device type, and task characteristics.
The findings demonstrate that model deviations are systematic rather than
random and highlight the need for category-aware and device-reflective power
parameters in reproducible sustainability reporting frameworks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究综述了动态SoSs中运行时组合的挑战、解决方案、工具和评估方法，揭示了关键差距并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代系统之系统（SoSs）在动态环境（如智慧城市、自动驾驶汽车）中运行，运行时组合（即动态发现、集成和协调组成系统）对适应性至关重要。尽管兴趣增长，但文献缺乏对动态SoSs中运行时组合的综合性综述。

Method: 研究采用了系统文献综述（SLR）方法，筛选了2019年至2024年间发表的1,774项研究，并选择了80项主要研究进行主题分析（TA）。

Result: 挑战分为四类：建模与分析、弹性操作、系统编排和组成系统的异构性。解决方案涵盖七个领域：共仿真与数字孪生、语义本体、集成框架、自适应架构、中间件、形式化方法和AI驱动的弹性。面向服务的组合与集成框架主导工具，而仿真平台支持评估。工具间的互操作性、跨工具链工作流的有限性以及标准化基准的缺失仍是关键差距。评估方法包括基于仿真的、实施驱动的和以人为中心的研究，应用于智慧城市、医疗、国防和工业自动化等领域。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了动态系统之系统（SoSs）运行时组合中的张力，包括自治与协调、建模与现实差距以及社会技术整合。研究呼吁制定标准化评估指标、可扩展的分散架构和跨领域框架，旨在指导研究人员和实践者开发和实施动态可组合的SoSs。

Abstract: Context: Modern Systems of Systems (SoSs) increasingly operate in dynamic
environments (e.g., smart cities, autonomous vehicles) where runtime
composition -- the on-the-fly discovery, integration, and coordination of
constituent systems (CSs)--is crucial for adaptability. Despite growing
interest, the literature lacks a cohesive synthesis of runtime composition in
dynamic SoSs. Objective: This study synthesizes research on runtime composition
in dynamic SoSs and identifies core challenges, solution strategies, supporting
tools, and evaluation methods. Methods: We conducted a Systematic Literature
Review (SLR), screening 1,774 studies published between 2019 and 2024 and
selecting 80 primary studies for thematic analysis (TA). Results: Challenges
fall into four categories: modeling and analysis, resilient operations, system
orchestration, and heterogeneity of CSs. Solutions span seven areas:
co-simulation and digital twins, semantic ontologies, integration frameworks,
adaptive architectures, middleware, formal methods, and AI-driven resilience.
Service-oriented frameworks for composition and integration dominate tooling,
while simulation platforms support evaluation. Interoperability across tools,
limited cross-toolchain workflows, and the absence of standardized benchmarks
remain key gaps. Evaluation approaches include simulation-based,
implementation-driven, and human-centered studies, which have been applied in
domains such as smart cities, healthcare, defense, and industrial automation.
Conclusions: The synthesis reveals tensions, including autonomy versus
coordination, the modeling-reality gap, and socio-technical integration. It
calls for standardized evaluation metrics, scalable decentralized
architectures, and cross-domain frameworks. The analysis aims to guide
researchers and practitioners in developing and implementing dynamically
composable SoSs.

*Cedric Richter,Heike Wehrheim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NL2Contract利用LLMs将自然语言转化为功能合约，减少验证误报，提升软件验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动软件验证中因缺乏规范而导致的误报问题，利用LLMs从代码中的自然语言提示推断正式功能合约。

Method: 引入了NL2Contract任务，使用LLMs将非正式自然语言转化为正式功能合约，包括后置条件和前置条件。并引入指标来验证和比较不同的NL2Contract方法。

Result: LLMs在生成功能性合约方面表现有效，生成的合约具有较高的表达力和区分能力，验证器使用这些合约时误报率降低。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成适用于所有可能输入的功能性合约方面表现良好，生成的合约在区分有缺陷和正确行为方面足够表达力，且验证器在使用LLM推断的功能性合约时产生的误报较少。

Abstract: Automatic software verifiers have become increasingly effective at the task
of checking software against (formal) specifications. Yet, their adoption in
practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world
code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal
postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function
names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as
specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to
suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to
be false alarms.
  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from
natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the
process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate
informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of
postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and
compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative
power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of
automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with
different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation
nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at
generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the
generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from
correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional
contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions
alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally
align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software
verifiers to catch real-world bugs.

TL;DR: MM-assist是一个结合LLM、IDE和静态分析的端到端MOVEMETHOD重构工具，显著提升了建议的准确性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MOVEMETHOD重构工具的建议与专家开发者的实践不符，而LLM虽能提供专家级建议，但存在高达80%的幻觉问题，因此需要一种端到端的自动化解决方案。

Method: 设计了新颖的解决方案，包括利用IDE静态分析过滤LLM幻觉，要求LLM自洽、批判和排序重构建议，并采用重构感知的检索增强生成（RAG）解决LLM上下文限制。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，Recall@1和Recall@3提升了1.7倍；在开源软件的210个重构案例中，召回率至少提高了2.4倍。

Conclusion: MM-assist通过结合LLM、IDE、静态分析和语义相关性，显著提升了MOVEMETHOD重构的准确性和实用性，用户研究显示其推荐获得了82.8%的正面评价。

Abstract: MOVEMETHOD is a hallmark refactoring. Despite a plethora of research tools
that recommend which methods to move and where, these recommendations do not
align with how expert developers perform MOVEMETHOD. Given the extensive
training of Large Language Models and their reliance upon naturalness of code,
they should expertly recommend which methods are misplaced in a given class and
which classes are better hosts. Our formative study of 2016 LLM recommendations
revealed that LLMs give expert suggestions, yet they are unreliable: up to 80%
of the suggestions are hallucinations. We introduce the first LLM fully powered
assistant for MOVEMETHOD refactoring that automates its whole end-to-end
lifecycle, from recommendation to execution. We designed novel solutions that
automatically filter LLM hallucinations using static analysis from IDEs and a
novel workflow that requires LLMs to be self-consistent, critique, and rank
refactoring suggestions. As MOVEMETHOD refactoring requires global,
projectlevel reasoning, we solved the limited context size of LLMs by employing
refactoring-aware retrieval augment generation (RAG). Our approach, MM-assist,
synergistically combines the strengths of the LLM, IDE, static analysis, and
semantic relevance. In our thorough, multi-methodology empirical evaluation, we
compare MM-assist with the previous state-of-the-art approaches. MM-assist
significantly outperforms them: (i) on a benchmark widely used by other
researchers, our Recall@1 and Recall@3 show a 1.7x improvement; (ii) on a
corpus of 210 recent refactorings from Open-source software, our Recall rates
improve by at least 2.4x. Lastly, we conducted a user study with 30 experienced
participants who used MM-assist to refactor their own code for one week. They
rated 82.8% of MM-assist recommendations positively. This shows that MM-assist
is both effective and useful.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管 milli/microrobot 在实验室中取得了显著进展，但实际临床应用的可行性仍然有限。作者希望通过 mTRL 框架解决这一转化难题。

Method: 本文通过分析 milli/microrobot 领域的技术与临床应用之间的脱节，提出了 mTRL 框架，以评估技术成熟度并指导跨学科合作。

Result: mTRL 框架为 milli/microrobot 技术的开发提供了一种结构化评估工具，有望加速其临床转化。

Conclusion: 作者提出了一个战略性的 milli/microrobot 技术就绪水平框架（mTRL），旨在通过明确的里程碑和逐步活动，加速技术从实验室到临床的转化。

Abstract: Untethered mobile milli/microrobots hold transformative potential for
interventional medicine by enabling more precise and entirely non-invasive
diagnosis and therapy. Realizing this promise requires bridging the gap between
groundbreaking laboratory demonstrations and successful clinical integration.
Despite remarkable technical progress over the past two decades, most
millirobots and microrobots remain confined to laboratory proof-of-concept
demonstrations, with limited real-world feasibility. In this Review, we
identify key factors that slow translation from bench to bedside, focusing on
the disconnect between technical innovation and real-world application. We
argue that the long-term impact and sustainability of the field depend on
aligning development with unmet medical needs, ensuring applied feasibility,
and integrating seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, which are
essential pillars for delivering meaningful patient outcomes. To support this
shift, we introduce a strategic milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level
framework (mTRL), which maps system development from initial conceptualization
to clinical adoption through clearly defined milestones and their associated
stepwise activities. The mTRL model provides a structured gauge of
technological maturity, a common language for cross-disciplinary collaboration
and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development toward new,
safer and more efficient interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于地标语义注册的方法在地标重复或误导性较强时性能受限，需要更精细的语义分布建模来提升定位准确性。

Method: 提出了一种基于轻量级三层场景图（对象层、连续语义分布函数层和度量-语义层）的全局定位算法，利用高斯过程学习的连续函数捕捉细粒度地理语义信息。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，Outram-GSF算法优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: Outram-GSF算法通过轻量级的三层场景图和连续语义分布函数，显著提升了一次性LiDAR全局定位的性能，并在公开数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 为了解决自主地面车辆在越野环境中必须实时规划曲率可行路径，同时考虑空间变化的土壤强度和坡度危害的问题。

Method: 提出了一种连续状态-成本度量，结合了Bekker压力-沉降模型与高程导出的坡度和姿态惩罚。该度量在网格上评估，使用精确的转向原语（如Dubins和Reeds-Shepp运动）。全局探索采用Vehicle-Dynamics RRT*，局部修复由Vehicle-Dynamics D* Lite管理。

Result: 硬件试验证明，该框架能够在软土和坡度过渡中实现实时导航，支持非结构化环境中的可靠自主性。

Conclusion: 该框架为可变形地形中的确定性、基于采样或学习驱动的规划提供了可重复使用的基础，支持在非结构化环境中实现可靠的自主导航。

Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles operating off-road must plan curvature-feasible
paths while accounting for spatially varying soil strength and slope hazards in
real time. We present a continuous state--cost metric that combines a Bekker
pressure--sinkage model with elevation-derived slope and attitude penalties.
The resulting terrain cost field is analytic, bounded, and monotonic in soil
modulus and slope, ensuring well-posed discretization and stable updates under
sensor noise. This metric is evaluated on a lattice with exact steering
primitives: Dubins and Reeds--Shepp motions for differential drive and
time-parameterized bicycle arcs for Ackermann steering. Global exploration is
performed using Vehicle-Dynamics RRT\(^{*}\), while local repair is managed by
Vehicle-Dynamics D\(^{*}\) Lite, enabling millisecond-scale replanning without
heuristic smoothing. By separating the terrain--vehicle model from the planner,
the framework provides a reusable basis for deterministic, sampling-based, or
learning-driven planning in deformable terrain. Hardware trials on an off-road
platform demonstrate real-time navigation across soft soil and slope
transitions, supporting reliable autonomy in unstructured environments.

Motivation: 评估自动驾驶车辆安全性需要多样化的安全关键场景，尤其是碰撞场景，但在现实中收集这些场景既罕见又不安全。

Method: 提出COLLIDE数据集和一个预测碰撞模式的框架，该框架在展开完整对抗轨迹之前预测碰撞模式。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在碰撞率和可控性方面均优于强基线，生成的场景能持续诱导更高的规划器失败率。

Conclusion: 生成的可控碰撞场景能够有效提升自动驾驶规划器的鲁棒性，为不同碰撞场景下的安全部署做出贡献。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse,
safety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare
and unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been
focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However,
controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA)
remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision
scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a
user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of
automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we
present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by
transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across
five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a
framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable
representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the
adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial
trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines
in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios
consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of
existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for
robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different
collision scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的框架成功地在动态人类环境中实现了移动机器人导航，平衡了适应性和安全性，并通过实验验证了其优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Mobile robot navigation in dynamic human environments requires policies that
balance adaptability to diverse behaviors with compliance to safety
constraints. We hypothesize that integrating data-driven rewards with
rule-based objectives enables navigation policies to achieve a more effective
balance of adaptability and safety. To this end, we develop a framework that
learns a density-based reward from positive and negative demonstrations and
augments it with rule-based objectives for obstacle avoidance and goal
reaching. A sampling-based lookahead controller produces supervisory actions
that are both safe and adaptive, which are subsequently distilled into a
compact student policy suitable for real-time operation with uncertainty
estimates. Experiments in synthetic and elevator co-boarding simulations show
consistent gains in success rate and time efficiency over baselines, and
real-world demonstrations with human participants confirm the practicality of
deployment. A video illustrating this work can be found on our project page

TL;DR: SF是一种无需显式3D输入的对齐策略，通过中间嵌入对齐增强VLA模型的空间理解能力，实验证明其在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型大多基于仅2D数据预训练的视觉语言模型，缺乏准确的空间感知能力，限制了其在3D物理世界中的操作能力。

Method: 提出了一种名为Spatial Forcing（SF）的对齐策略，通过将VLA模型的中间视觉嵌入与预训练3D基础模型的几何表示对齐，隐式地增强模型的空间理解能力。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中的大量实验表明，SF取得了最先进的结果，超越了基于2D和3D的VLA模型，并加速了训练速度高达3.8倍，提高了数据效率。

Conclusion: SF通过中间视觉嵌入与预训练3D基础模型的几何表示对齐，成功提升了VLA模型的空间理解能力，无需依赖显式3D输入或深度估计器。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in
enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions.
However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on
2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to
operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate
explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these
approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and
incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that
estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of
depth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective
alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial
comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth
estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric
representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing
alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial
representations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves
state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further
accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse
robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/

Abstract: This paper presents a shape-aware whole-body control framework for
tendon-driven continuum robots with direct application to endoluminal surgical
navigation. Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and
safe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional
tip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to
reach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a
physics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented
Neural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian
computation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller
leverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone
conformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. A task manager
further enhances adaptability by allowing real-time adjustment of objectives,
such as wall clearance or direct advancement, during tele-operation. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate millimeter-level accuracy across diverse
scenarios, including trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and
shape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on a bronchoscopy phantom
validate the framework, showing improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall
contacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and
existing baselines. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
framework to increase safety, reliability, and operator efficiency in minimally
invasive endoluminal surgery, with broader applicability to other confined and
safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Recently, biped robot walking technology has been significantly developed,
mainly in the context of a bland walking scheme. To emulate human walking,
robots need to step on the positions they see in unknown spaces accurately. In
this paper, we present PolyMap, a perception-based locomotion planning

odometry are done by multi-sensor fusion(LiDAR, RGB-D camera and IMUs). The
proposed framework is deployed on a NVIDIA Orin, which performs 20-30 Hz
whole-body motion planning output. Both indoor and outdoor real-scene

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has facilitated numerous transformative
advancements in artificial intelligence research in recent years. However, in
the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot motion control, individual
skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some
generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging
to a single robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for
pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can
subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic
actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin
with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather
diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive
Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained
weights are loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the
policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed
method on seven distinct robot motion control tasks, showing significant
benefits to this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average
improves sample efficiency by 40.1% and task performance by 7.5%, compared to
random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical
analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of our
method.

Abstract: Legibility of robot motion is critical in human-robot interaction, as it
allows humans to quickly infer a robot's intended goal. Although traditional
trajectory generation methods typically prioritize efficiency, they often fail
to make the robot's intentions clear to humans. Meanwhile, existing approaches
to legible motion usually produce only a single "most legible" trajectory,
overlooking the need to modulate intent expressiveness in different contexts.
In this work, we propose a novel motion generation framework that enables
controllable legibility across the full spectrum, from highly legible to highly
ambiguous motions. We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information
Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and
build upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths
at specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot
actions. Experiments in both 2D and 3D reaching tasks demonstrate that our
approach produces diverse and controllable motions with varying degrees of
legibility, while achieving performance comparable to SOTA. Code and project

Conclusion: 提出的自引导和自适应分块技术显著提高了生成行为克隆（GBC）的一致性和反应性，在模拟和真实世界的机器人操作任务中表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Generative Behavior Cloning (GBC) is a simple yet effective framework for
robot learning, particularly in multi-task settings. Recent GBC methods often
employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are
generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without
replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and
generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action
sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL
control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy
or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel
techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1)
self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations
and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking,
which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity
outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our
approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of
simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the applicability of tactile sensors by simplifying their fabrication and integration processes.

Method: The sensor is fabricated using conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments in a multi-material FDM 3D printer, creating a hierarchical structure with specific infill patterns that change electrical resistance under pressure.

Result: The sensor successfully measures tactile information through resistance changes and is applied in motion pattern measurement, robotic hand integration, and tactile-based operations.

Conclusion: The proposed M3D-skin tactile sensor demonstrates effectiveness in various applications, validating its versatility and ease of fabrication.

Abstract: Tactile sensors have a wide range of applications, from utilization in
robotic grippers to human motion measurement. If tactile sensors could be
fabricated and integrated more easily, their applicability would further
expand. In this study, we propose a tactile sensor-M3D-skin-that can be easily
fabricated with high versatility by leveraging the infill patterns of a
multi-material fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer as the sensing
principle. This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments
to create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible
hierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in
electrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We
measure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by
modifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the
fabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we
implement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a
robotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations. Through these experiments,
we validate the effectiveness of the proposed tactile sensor.

Abstract: In a Human-Robot Cooperation (HRC) environment, safety and efficiency are the
two core properties to evaluate robot performance. However, safety mechanisms
usually hinder task efficiency since human intervention will cause backup
motions and goal failures of the robot. Frequent motion replanning will
increase the computational load and the chance of failure. In this paper, we
present a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) planning framework which is
comprised of an interactive motion planner and a RL task planner. The RL task
planner attempts to choose statistically safe and efficient task sequences
based on the feedback from the motion planner, while the motion planner keeps
the task execution process collision-free by detecting human arm motions and
deploying new paths when the previous path is not valid anymore. Intuitively,
the RL agent will learn to avoid dangerous tasks, while the motion planner
ensures that the chosen tasks are safe. The proposed framework is validated on
the cobot in both simulation and the real world, we compare the planner with
hard-coded task motion planning methods. The results show that our planning
framework can 1) react to uncertain human motions at both joint and task
levels; 2) reduce the times of repeating failed goal commands; 3) reduce the
total number of replanning requests.

Abstract: Pruning is an essential agricultural practice for orchards. Proper pruning
can promote healthier growth and optimize fruit production throughout the
orchard's lifespan. Robot manipulators have been developed as an automated
solution for this repetitive task, which typically requires seasonal labor with
specialized skills. While previous research has primarily focused on the
challenges of perception, the complexities of manipulation are often
overlooked. These challenges involve planning and control in both joint and
Cartesian spaces to guide the end-effector through intricate, obstructive
branches. Our work addresses the behavior planning challenge for a robotic
pruning system, which entails a multi-level planning problem in environments
with complex collisions. In this paper, we formulate the planning problem for a
high-dimensional robotic arm in a pruning scenario, investigate the system's
intrinsic redundancies, and propose a comprehensive pruning workflow that
integrates perception, modeling, and holistic planning. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance
the performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed
workflow on a real-world robot. As a result, this work complements previous
efforts on robotic pruning and motivates future research and development in
planning for pruning applications.

Abstract: Tactile perception is crucial for embodied intelligent robots to recognize
objects. Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes
multidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process
generates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional
extraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object
attributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To
address this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature
extraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems.
This strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external
object features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional
reconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring
contact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural
network (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and
effective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying
shapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N
range). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition
accuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in
actual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%. Focused on object physical attributes
perception, this method enhances the artificial tactile system ability to
transition from perception to cognition, enabling its use in embodied
perception applications.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of high-speed agile quadrotor flight, achieving
precise trajectory tracking at the platform's operational limits is paramount.
Controllers must handle actuator constraints, exhibit robustness to
disturbances, and remain computationally efficient for safety-critical

controller for agile flight control. The controller addresses individual
limitations of existing state-of-the-art control paradigms and unifies their
strengths. We demonstrate the controller's capabilities, including the accurate
tracking of highly aggressive trajectories that surpass the feasibility of the
actuators. Notably, the controller provides universal stability guarantees,
enhancing its robustness and tracking performance even in exceedingly
disturbance-prone settings. Its nonlinear feedback structure is highly
efficient enabling fast computation at high update rates. Moreover, the
learning process in simulation is both fast and stable, and the controller's
inherent robustness allows direct deployment to real-world platforms without
the need for training augmentations or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 通过引入控制置信度的优化框架，本研究为自主工具设计提供了更高的鲁棒性，平衡了目标准确性和环境不确定性下的性能稳定性。

Abstract: Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just
maximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing
their confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor
contributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least
performance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current
autonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization,
without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here,
we take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization
framework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where
ii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization
routine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through
rigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with
control confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental
uncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further
show that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design
provides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed
tools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based
evolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other
state-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest
iterations. Code: https://github.com/ajitham123/Tool_design_control_confidence.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for human-robot \emph{logical} interaction that
enables robots to reliably satisfy (infinite horizon) temporal logic tasks
while effectively collaborating with humans who pursue independent and unknown
tasks. The framework combines two key capabilities: (i) \emph{maximal
adaptation} enables the robot to adjust its strategy \emph{online} to exploit
human behavior for cooperation whenever possible, and (ii) \emph{minimal
tunable feedback} enables the robot to request cooperation by the human online
only when necessary to guarantee progress. This balance minimizes human-robot
interference, preserves human autonomy, and ensures persistent robot task
satisfaction even under conflicting human goals. We validate the approach in a
real-world block-manipulation task with a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm and in
the Overcooked-AI benchmark, demonstrating that our method produces rich,
\emph{emergent} cooperative behaviors beyond the reach of existing approaches,
while maintaining strong formal guarantees.

Abstract: Robotics plays a pivotal role in planetary science and exploration, where
autonomous and reliable systems are crucial due to the risks and challenges
inherent to space environments. The establishment of permanent lunar bases
demands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh
lunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary
exploration, their limitations in unstructured and steep terrains motivate the
adoption of legged robots, which offer superior mobility and adaptability. This
paper introduces a constrained reinforcement learning framework designed for
autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators operating in lunar environments. The
proposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation
capabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including
collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to
ensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced
gravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking,
achieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of
8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints,
exhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work
effectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety
requirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for
future lunar missions.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap
towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel,
specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement
learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often
suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce
Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation
without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop
where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and
execution.
  The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the
full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway
enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically
synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This
provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy
exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk
of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the
actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven
Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and
selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent
remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a
conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration.
  We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results
demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final
success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust
solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably
adapt to new environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种GPU并行化残差架构，将MPC与RL在扭矩控制层面紧密结合，结合了两者的优势，实现了更高的效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC提供了可解释、可调谐的运动控制器，但其鲁棒性依赖于频繁的重新规划和实时计算约束；RL能通过随机训练产生高度鲁棒行为，但缺乏可解释性且需要密集的奖励工程。两者的结合有望弥补各自不足。

Method: 开发了一种运动学全身MPC公式，在RL训练中以100 Hz的频率并行评估数千个代理。残差策略学习对MPC输出进行针对性修正，结合了基于模型控制的约束处理能力和RL的适应性。

Result: 与独立的MPC或端到端RL相比，该方法实现了更高的样本效率、更大的渐进奖励、更广的可追踪速度命令范围，并支持对未见步态和不平地形的零样本适应。

Conclusion: 该研究通过GPU并行化残差架构，将MPC与RL紧密结合，在扭矩控制层面融合两者的输出，成功结合了基于模型控制的解释性与RL的适应性，实现了更高的样本效率、更大的渐进奖励、更广的可追踪速度命令范围，并支持对未见步态和不平地形的零样本适应。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides interpretable, tunable locomotion
controllers grounded in physical models, but its robustness depends on frequent
replanning and is limited by model mismatch and real-time computational
constraints. Reinforcement Learning (RL), by contrast, can produce highly
robust behaviors through stochastic training but often lacks interpretability,
suffers from out-of-distribution failures, and requires intensive reward
engineering. This work presents a GPU-parallelized residual architecture that
tightly integrates MPC and RL by blending their outputs at the torque-control
level. We develop a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across
thousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training. The residual policy
learns to make targeted corrections to the MPC outputs, combining the
interpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the
adaptability of RL. The model-based control prior acts as a strong bias,
initializing and guiding the policy towards desirable behavior with a simple
set of rewards. Compared to standalone MPC or end-to-end RL, our approach
achieves higher sample efficiency, converges to greater asymptotic rewards,
expands the range of trackable velocity commands, and enables zero-shot
adaptation to unseen gaits and uneven terrain.

Conclusion: T(R,O) Grasp通过其统一的T(R,O)图和高效的扩散模型，显著提高了抓取的成功率和推理速度，展现了作为灵巧抓取基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: Dexterous grasping remains a central challenge in robotics due to the
complexity of its high-dimensional state and action space. We introduce T(R,O)
Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and
diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph,
a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic
hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion
model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both
unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a
diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success
rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per
second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing
baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across
embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly,
the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation,
underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for
dexterous grasping.

Motivation: 在复杂的城市环境中，安全且可解释的运动规划需要处理双向多智能体交互，现有方法依赖于精心设计的成本函数，这在广泛场景中具有挑战性。

Method: HYPE结合了学习到的提案模型生成的多模态轨迹提案和MCTS细化，通过自我条件占用预测模型来建模双向交互。

Conclusion: HYPE通过整合学习到的多模态轨迹提案和MCTS细化，显著简化了成本函数设计，并在nuPlan和DeepUrban基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，特别是在安全性和适应性方面。

Abstract: Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to
reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to
estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners
generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by
optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires
a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a
cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex
urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego
proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal
trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,
we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling
consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost
function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance,
requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale
real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves
state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的方法，通过引入k-尊重切割身份，为验证树的薄性提供了高效的解决方案，并展示了在不同图结构中的优化保证。

Abstract: Thin spanning trees lie at the intersection of graph theory, approximation
algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. They are central to the
long-standing \emph{thin tree conjecture}, which asks whether every
$k$-edge-connected graph contains an $O(1/k)$-thin tree, and they underpin
algorithmic breakthroughs such as the $O(\log n/\log\log n)$-approximation for
ATSP. Yet even the basic algorithmic task of \emph{verifying} that a given tree
is thin has remained elusive: checking thinness requires reasoning about
exponentially many cuts, and no efficient certificates have been known.
  We introduce a new machinery of \emph{$k$-respecting cut identities}, which
express the weight of every cut that crosses a spanning tree in at most $k$
edges as a simple function of pairwise ($2$-respecting) cuts. This yields a
tree-local oracle that, after $O(n^2)$ preprocessing, evaluates such cuts in
$O_k(1)$ time. Building on this oracle, we give the first procedure to compute
the exact $k$-thinness certificate $\Theta_k(T)$ of any spanning tree for fixed
$k$ in time $\tilde O(n^2+n^k)$, outputting both the certificate value and a
witnessing cut.
  Beyond general graphs, our framework yields sharper guarantees in structured
settings. In planar graphs, duality with cycles and dual girth imply that every
spanning tree admits a verifiable certificate $\Theta_k(T)\le k/\lambda$ (hence
$O(1/\lambda)$ for constant $k$). In graphs embedded on a surface of genus
$\gamma$, refined counting gives certified (per-cut) bounds $O((\log
n+\gamma)/\lambda)$ via the same ensemble coverage.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Dominating $H$-Pattern问题，提出定制化分支定界方法，实验显示其性能优于现有方法，改进达两个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索在条件性几乎最优的最坏情况下性能下，算法是否能在实际输入中高效解决Dominating $H$-Pattern问题。

Method: 开发并实验评估了多种方法，包括基于Glasgow子图求解器（GSS）、SAT求解器Kissat和ILP求解器Gurobi的基线方法，以及一种定制化的分支定界方法。

Result: 定制化分支定界方法在测试实例上表现优异，改进幅度高达两个数量级。

Conclusion: 通过实验评估，提出的定制化分支定界方法在测试实例上实现了高达两个数量级的改进，显著优于现有求解器。

Abstract: The \emph{Dominating $H$-Pattern} problem generalizes the classical
$k$-Dominating Set problem: for a fixed \emph{pattern} $H$ and a given graph
$G$, the goal is to find an induced subgraph $S$ of $G$ such that (1) $S$ is
isomorphic to $H$, and (2) $S$ forms a dominating set in $G$. Fine-grained
complexity results show that on worst-case inputs, any significant improvement
over the naive brute-force algorithm is unlikely, as this would refute the
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. Nevertheless, a recent work by Dransfeld et
al. (ESA 2025) reveals some significant improvement potential particularly in
\emph{sparse} graphs.
  We ask: Can algorithms with conditionally almost-optimal worst-case
performance solve the Dominating $H$-Pattern, for selected patterns $H$,
efficiently on practical inputs? We develop and experimentally evaluate several
approaches on a large benchmark of diverse datasets, including baseline
approaches using the Glasgow Subgraph Solver (GSS), the SAT solver Kissat, and
the ILP solver Gurobi.
  Notably, while a straightforward implementation of the algorithms -- with
conditionally close-to-optimal worst-case guarantee -- performs comparably to
existing solvers, we propose a tailored Branch-\&-Bound approach --
supplemented with careful pruning techniques -- that achieves improvements of
up to two orders of magnitude on our test instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EM问题的确定性多项式时间算法尚未完全解决，使其成为测试P=RP假设的自然候选。TkPM问题作为其多项式时间等价问题，也值得深入研究。

Method: 研究了在输入图为膨胀图的情况下，TkPM和EM问题的解法。提出了一个基于参数k和邻域多样性的FPT算法，并将其扩展为近似方案。此外，还开发了一个递归算法，用于处理带宽有限但规模无界的原型图。

Result: 提出了针对TkPM的FPT算法和近似方案，并在原型图带宽有限的情况下开发了递归算法。同时，将这一递归算法适应于EM问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种针对TkPM和EM问题的FPT算法和近似方案，特别是在输入图为膨胀图的情况下。通过利用动态规划和分离器的性质，算法在参数化复杂度和时间效率上取得了显著进展。

Abstract: The Exact Matching (EM) problem asks whether there exists a perfect matching
which uses a prescribed number of red edges in a red/blue edge-colored graph.
While there exists a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for the problem, only
some special cases admit a deterministic one so far, making it a natural
candidate for testing the P=RP hypothesis. A polynomial-time equivalent
problem, Top-k Perfect Matching (TkPM), asks for a perfect matching maximizing
the weight of the $k$ heaviest edges.
  We study the above problems, mainly the latter, in the scenario where the
input is a blown-up graph, meaning a graph which had its vertices replaced by
cliques or independent sets. We describe an FPT algorithm for TkPM
parameterized by $k$ and the neighborhood diversity of the input graph, which
is essentially the size of the graph before the blow-up; this graph is also
called the prototype. We extend this algorithm into an approximation scheme
with a much softer dependency on the aforementioned parameters, time-complexity
wise. Moreover, for prototypes with bounded bandwidth but unbounded size, we
develop a recursive algorithm that runs in subexponential time. Utilizing
another algorithm for EM on bounded neighborhood diversity graphs, we adapt
this recursive subexponential algorithm to EM.
  Our approach is similar to the use of dynamic programming on e.g. bounded
treewidth instances for various problems. The main point is that the existence
of many disjoint separators is utilized to avoid including in the separator any
of a set of ``bad'' vertices during the split phase.

Motivation: 随机算法虽然能实现最优球大小，但其确定性版本因额外的O(log n)因子而效率不足。本文旨在消除这一因子，提高算法效率。

Method: 利用球大小可以由算法自适应选择的特点，提出了一种确定性算法，并在不同成本函数下实现了平均最优成本。

Result: 确定性算法实现了平均最优球大小Θ(n/r)，并成功反随机化了[DMSY23]和Thorup-Zwick近似距离预言。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种简单的确定性算法，实现了平均最优的球大小Θ(n/r)，并且能够在不增加时间/空间复杂度的情况下，对Thorup-Zwick近似距离预言进行确定性处理。

Abstract: A common step in algorithms related to shortest paths in undirected graphs is
that, we select a subset of vertices as centers, then grow a ball around each
vertex until a center is reached. We want the balls to be as small as possible.
A randomized algorithm can uniformly sample $r$ centers to achieve the optimal
(expected) ball size of $\Theta(n/r)$. A folklore derandomization is to use the
$O(\log n)$ approximation for the set cover problem in the hitting set version
where we want to hit all the balls with the centers.
  However, the extra $O(\log n)$ factor is sometimes too expensive. For
example, the recent $O(m\sqrt{\log n\log\log n})$ undirected single-source
shortest path algorithm [DMSY23] beats Dijkstra's algorithm in sparse graphs,
but the folklore derandomization would make it dominated by Dijkstra's.
  In this paper, we exploit the fact that the sizes of these balls can be
adaptively chosen by the algorithm instead of fixed by the input. We propose a
simple deterministic algorithm achieving the optimal ball size of $\Theta(n/r)$
on average. Furthermore, given any polynomially large cost function of the ball
size, we can still achieve the optimal cost on average. It allows us to
derandomize [DMSY23], resulting in a deterministic $O(m\sqrt{\log n\log\log
n})$ algorithm for undirected single-source shortest path.
  In addition, we show that the same technique can also be used to derandomize
the seminal Thorup-Zwick approximate distance oracle [TZ05], also without any
loss in the time/space complexity.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种确定性的几乎线性时间（Δ+1）着色算法，突破了之前的时间复杂度障碍。

Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that any $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph of maximum degree
$\Delta$ can be edge colored using at most $\Delta + 1$ different colors.
Vizing's original proof is easily translated into a deterministic $O(mn)$ time
algorithm. This deterministic time bound was subsequently improved to $\tilde
O(m \sqrt n)$ time, independently by [Arjomandi, 1982] and by [Gabow et al.,
1985].
  A series of recent papers improved the time bound of $\tilde O(m\sqrt{n})$
using randomization, culminating in the randomized near-linear time
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm by [Assadi, Behnezhad, Bhattacharya, Costa,
Solomon, and Zhang, 2025]. At the heart of all of these recent improvements,
there is some form of a sublinear time algorithm. Unfortunately, sublinear time
algorithms as a whole almost always require randomization. This raises a
natural question: can the deterministic time complexity of the problem be
reduced below the $\tilde O(m\sqrt{n})$ barrier?
  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. We present a
deterministic almost-linear time $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm, namely, an
algorithm running in $m \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{\log \Delta})} \cdot \log n =
m^{1+o(1)}$ time. Our main technical contribution is to entirely forego
sublinear time algorithms. We do so by presenting a new deterministic
color-type sparsification approach that runs in almost-linear (instead of
sublinear) time, but can be used to color a much larger set of edges.

Method: FlexPipe采用细粒度模型分区、实时管道重构和拓扑感知资源分配三项关键技术，动态调整管道架构以适应实时请求模式。

Result: 在82-GPU集群上的评估显示，FlexPipe资源效率提升8.5倍，延迟降低38.3%，GPU峰值容量需求从75%降至30%。

Conclusion: FlexPipe通过动态调整管道架构，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）在生产环境中的资源效率和响应速度，解决了资源碎片化和动态工作负载的挑战。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in production faces significant
challenges from highly variable request patterns and severe resource
fragmentation in serverless clusters. Current systems rely on static pipeline
configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading
to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that
dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these
fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages
and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request
pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model
partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline
refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource
allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an
82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource
efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art
systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak
capacity.

Abstract: Process mapping asks to assign vertices of a task graph to processing
elements of a supercomputer such that the computational workload is balanced
while the communication cost is minimized. Motivated by the recent success of
GPU-based graph partitioners, we propose two GPU-accelerated algorithms for
this optimization problem. The first algorithm employs hierarchical
multisection, which partitions the task graph alongside the hierarchy of the
supercomputer. The method utilizes GPU-based graph partitioners to accelerate
the mapping process. The second algorithm integrates process mapping directly
into the modern multilevel graph partitioning pipeline. Vital phases like
coarsening and refinement are accelerated by exploiting the parallelism of
GPUs. In our experiments, both methods achieve speedups exceeding 300 when
compared to state-of-the-art CPU-based algorithms. The first algorithm has, on
average, about 10 percent greater communication costs and thus remains
competitive to CPU algorithms. The second approach is much faster, with a
geometric mean speedup of 77.6 and peak speedup of 598 at the cost of lower
solution quality. To our knowledge, these are the first GPU-based algorithms
for process mapping.

TL;DR: Metronome是一种网络和优先级感知的云原生网络调度机制，通过时分复用和多目标优化，显著提升资源利用率和作业性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算能力需求的快速增长，云原生网络成为解决高效资源协调挑战的有前景方案，特别是在应对集群中网络带宽动态波动方面。

Method: Metronome采用时分复用方法，利用作业流量特征构建弹性网络资源分配模型，并结合多目标优化策略，同时考虑延迟和作业优先级，实现全局最优和动态资源分配。

Result: 在13种常见机器学习模型上的广泛实验表明，Metronome能够提升集群资源利用率，同时保证服务性能。

Conclusion: Metronome通过其网络感知和优先级感知的调度机制，显著提升了集群资源利用率并保证了服务性能，相比现有Kubernetes调度机制，在多种场景下将作业完成时间减少了高达19.50%，平均带宽利用率提高了高达23.20%。

Abstract: With the rapid growth in computing power demand, cloud native networks have
emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of efficient resource
coordination, particularly in coping with the dynamic fluctuations of network
bandwidth in clusters. We propose Metronome, a network-aware and priority-aware
scheduling mechanism for cloud native networks. This mechanism is designed to
support jobs that exhibit periodic traffic patterns and dynamic bandwidth
demands, particularly in the context of distributed training. Specifically,
Metronome employs a time-division multiplexing approach that leverages job
traffic characteristics to construct an elastic network resource allocation
model, enabling efficient bandwidth sharing across multiple jobs. In addition,
it incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy, jointly considering
latency and job priorities to achieve globally optimal as well as dynamic
resource allocation. Finally, Metronome adapts to the dynamic environment by
monitoring the cluster and performing reconfiguration operations. Extensive
experiments with 13 common machine learning models demonstrate that Metronome
can enhance cluster resource utilization while guaranteeing service
performance. Compared with the existing Kubernetes scheduling mechanisms across
multiple scenarios, Metronome reduces job completion time by up to 19.50% while
improving average bandwidth utilization by up to 23.20%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Kubernetes的工具，用于在数据共享管道中非侵入式地应用云设计模式，支持能源消耗监控，平衡了灵活性与能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据网格架构在联邦环境中的普及，组织越来越多地使用模块化、云原生转换服务构建消费者特定的数据共享管道。然而，将传统云设计模式集成到这些管道中会带来挑战：预定义和嵌入模式可能损害模块性、降低可重用性，并与管道的动态、消费者驱动性质冲突。

Result: 该工具支持自动化模式注入和能源消耗指标的收集，使开发者能够在保持管道灵活性和可组合性的同时，做出能源感知的决策。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于Kubernetes的工具，能够在不需要修改服务源代码的情况下，延迟且非侵入式地应用选定的云设计模式。这一方法既保留了数据共享管道的灵活性和可组合性，又支持了能源消耗指标的收集，帮助开发者在保持架构灵活性的同时做出能源感知的决策。

Abstract: As data mesh architectures gain traction in federated environments,
organizations are increasingly building consumer-specific data-sharing
pipelines using modular, cloud-native transformation services. Prior work has
shown that structuring these pipelines with reusable transformation stages
enhances both scalability and energy efficiency. However, integrating
traditional cloud design patterns into such pipelines poses a challenge:
predefining and embedding patterns can compromise modularity, reduce
reusability, and conflict with the pipelines dynamic, consumer-driven nature.
To address this, we introduce a Kubernetes-based tool that enables the deferred
and non-intrusive application of selected cloud design patterns without
requiring changes to service source code. The tool supports automated pattern
injection and collects energy consumption metrics, allowing developers to make
energy-aware decisions while preserving the flexible, composable structure of
reusable data-sharing pipelines.

TL;DR: TALP-Pages是一个轻量级框架，通过集成TALP工具和CI流程，为HPC代码开发提供快速的性能反馈和扩展效率分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在HPC代码开发过程中，早期检测性能退化和获取扩展行为的深入见解是至关重要的。

Method: TALP-Pages基于TALP工具，通过CI友好的文件夹结构生成HTML报告，展示性能因子回归和扩展效率表。

Result: 与基于追踪的工具相比，TALP-Pages在开销和后处理需求上表现更优，能更快生成扩展效率表。

Conclusion: TALP-Pages是一个易于集成且高效的框架，能够为开发者提供快速的代码性能反馈，特别是在HPC机器代码开发中。

Abstract: Ensuring good performance is a key aspect in the development of codes that
target HPC machines. As these codes are under active development, the necessity
to detect performance degradation early in the development process becomes
apparent. In addition, having meaningful insight into application scaling
behavior tightly coupled to the development workflow is helpful. In this paper,
we introduce TALP-Pages, an easy-to-integrate framework that enables developers
to get fast and in-repository feedback about their code performance using
established fundamental performance and scaling factors. The framework relies
on TALP, which enables the on-the-fly collection of these metrics. Based on a
folder structure suited for CI which contains the files generated by TALP,
TALP-Pages generates an HTML report with visualizations of the performance
factor regression as well as scaling-efficiency tables. We compare TALP-Pages
to tracing-based tools in terms of overhead and post-processing requirements
and find that TALP-Pages can produce the scaling-efficiency tables faster and
under tighter resource constraints. To showcase the ease of use and
effectiveness of this approach, we extend the current CI setup of GENE-X with
only minimal changes required and showcase the ability to detect and explain a
performance improvement.

TL;DR: 本研究首次实现了GPU上的带状矩阵到双对角形式的转换算法，性能显著优于CPU实现，尤其是在大矩阵上表现突出。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管带状矩阵转换为双对角形式是SVD的关键步骤，但传统认为其不适合GPU计算。随着GPU硬件的进步（如更大的L1内存），本研究旨在探索GPU在此类任务中的潜力。

Method: 基于CPU多核并行缓存高效凸点追逐算法，优化GPU吞吐量，利用Julia语言的数组抽象和KernelAbstractions实现跨硬件和数据精度的通用函数。

Result: GPU算法在1024 x 1024及以上矩阵上优于多线程CPU高性能库（如PLASMA和SLATE），在32k x 32k矩阵上性能提升超过100倍，且性能随矩阵带宽线性增长。

Conclusion: 本研究通过GPU算法成功突破了内存带宽和矩阵带宽的限制，显著提升了将带状矩阵转换为双对角形式的效率，尤其是在大矩阵（如32k x 32k）上表现尤为突出。

Abstract: The reduction of a banded matrix to a bidiagonal form is a crucial step in
the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a cornerstone of scientific computing
and AI. Despite being a highly parallel algorithm, it was previously believed
to be unsuitable for GPU computation because it is memory bandwidth-bound.
Recent developments in GPU hardware, including larger L1 memory per Streaming
Multiprocessor/Compute Unit, have changed that. We present the first GPU
algorithm for reducing a banded matrix to bidiagonal form as part of the
NextLA.jl open-source software package. Our algorithm is based on previous
CPU-based multicore parallel cache-efficient bulge chasing algorithms and
adapted to optimize for GPU throughput. We leverage Julia Language's Array
abstractions and KernelAbstractions to implement a single hardware- and data
precision-agnostic function on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple Metal GPUs for
half, single, and double precision, and examine performance optimization across
hardware architectures and data precision. We also develop a hardware-aware
performance model and identify key hyperparameters, such as inner tilewidth and
block concurrency, that govern optimal GPU execution for bandwidth-bound
workloads. We demonstrate highly parallel bandwidth-bound algorithm on the GPU
can outperform CPU-based implementations: the GPU algorithm outperforms
multithreaded CPU High-Performance libraries PLASMA and SLATE as of matrix size
1024 x 1024 and by a factor over 100 for matrices of 32k x 32k. In addition,
the performance of the algorithm increases linearly with matrix bandwidth size,
making faster reduction of larger matrix bandwidths now also possible. With
this work, we break memory bandwidth barriers, as well as matrix bandwidth
barriers, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster algorithms for the reduction
of banded matrices to bidiagonal form on the GPU.

Conclusion: Symphony成功解决了去中心化流量工程系统中的分歧导致的拥塞问题，同时保持了去中心化的故障隔离优势。

Abstract: Cloud providers have recently decentralized their wide-area network traffic
engineering (TE) systems to contain the impact of TE controller failures. In
the decentralized design, a controller fault only impacts its slice of the
network, limiting the blast radius to a fraction of the network. However, we
find that autonomous slice controllers can arrive at divergent traffic
allocations that overload links by 30% beyond their capacity. We present
Symphony, a decentralized TE system that addresses the challenge of
divergence-induced congestion while preserving the fault-isolation benefits of
decentralization. By augmenting TE objectives with quadratic regularization,
Symphony makes traffic allocations robust to demand perturbations, ensuring TE
controllers naturally converge to compatible allocations without coordination.
In parallel, Symphony's randomized slicing algorithm partitions the network to
minimize blast radius by distributing critical traffic sources across slices,
preventing any single failure from becoming catastrophic. These innovations
work in tandem: regularization ensures algorithmic stability to traffic
allocations while intelligent slicing provides architectural resilience in the
network. Through extensive evaluation on cloud provider WANs, we show Symphony
reduces divergence-induced congestion by 14x and blast radius by 79% compared
to current practice.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) with exponentially growing
parameters is making cross-data center (DC) training an inevitable trend.
However, viable strategies for extending single-DC training frameworks to
multi-DC environments remain underdeveloped. We experimentally demonstrate, for
the first time, a high-performance geo-distributed LLMs training framework
across multiple DCs interconnected by a lossless, remote direct memory access
(RDMA) enabled Datacenter Optical Transport Network (DC-OTN). An enhanced
pipeline parallelism scheme is implemented within the Ascend full-stack
environment of Huawei, which effectively eliminates the impact of cross-DC
communication overhead on training efficiency. The overlapped computation and
cross-DC communication is achieved with constraint cross-DC bandwidth and High
Bandwidth Memory (HBM), reducing computation bubble ratio by up to 78.91%.
