The current design of HPC clusters is\ninadequate to support this new class however, either incurring long wait times\non static batch queues or repeatedly paying expensive LLM startup costs upon\nresource preemption. To circumvent both the long queues and high startup costs,\nwe propose to \"decouple\" the LLM initialization context from the actual LLM\ninferences, and retain the context in GPUs until it is no longer needed, a\ntechnique we term \"Pervasive Context Management\". We transform a fact\nverification application to enable this technique, allowing it to reduce its\nexecution time by 72.1% (from 3 hours to 48 minutes) using the same amount of\nGPUs, and scale opportunistically on 32.8% of all GPUs in the cluster and\nfurther reduce the execution time to 13 minutes."}

Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating.

To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer,\nwe leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal\nforce signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using\nGPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves\nassembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data\ndiversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

To bridge this gap, we propose an inference\nscaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward\nmodel, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.\nTo train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process\nsupervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques\nto provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome\nreward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger\ncapability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference\nscaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the\nbackbone model performance across various function calling tasks and\nbenchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference\nscaling techniques to structured outputs: \"explore more but retain less\" due to\nthe unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation."}

Existing stall-free batching schedulers proposed by\nSarathi, while effective at preventing decode stalls, introduce significant\ncomputational unfairness. They prioritize decode tasks excessively,\nsimultaneously leading to underutilized decode slack and unnecessary prefill\nqueuing delays, which collectively degrade the system's overall quality of\nservice (QoS).\n  This work identifies the root cause of this unfairness: the non-monotonic\nnature of Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) as a scheduling metric and the rigid\ndecode-prioritizing policy that fails to adapt to dynamic workload bursts. We\ntherefore propose FairBatching, a novel LLM inference scheduler that enforces\nfair resource allocation between prefill and decode tasks. It features an\nadaptive batch capacity determination mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the\ncomputational budget to improve the GPU utilization without triggering SLO\nviolations. Its fair and dynamic batch formation algorithm breaks away from the\ndecode-prioritizing paradigm, allowing computation resources to be reclaimed\nfrom bursting decode tasks to serve prefill surges, achieving global fairness.\nFurthermore, FairBatching provides a novel load estimation method, enabling\nmore effective coordination with upper-level schedulers.

However, this multi-stage process is\nprone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling\nbetween semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway\nfrom language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.\nTherefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly\nconditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing\nexplicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based\npolicy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic\nintent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal\ntransformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency\nwhile maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations\nfor precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost\nsubstantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking\naccuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real\nhumanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities\nsuch as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for\nvision-language-action humanoid systems."}

Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned\nto learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task\ndemonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic\nrules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the\ntraining data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To\naddress these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer\n(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning\nthe visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the\ntraining data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,\ndemonstrating robustness across diverse settings.

Given recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We\napproach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task\nin which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional\ndemands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To\nsupport this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the\nmachine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical\nsimulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark\nstate-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities\nrequired for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and\ninstruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore\nreinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start\ndataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at\nthe intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning."}
