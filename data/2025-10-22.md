### [1] [MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17845)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAT-Agent是一种多智能体框架，通过动态优化策略在多标签图像分类中实现高性能，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多标签图像分类方法依赖静态配置，无法适应动态变化的视觉语义场景，因此需要一种能够实时协作优化的自适应训练策略。

Method: MAT-Agent采用多智能体框架，利用非平稳多臂老虎机算法动态调整数据增强、优化器、学习率和损失函数，结合双速率指数移动平均平滑和混合精度训练。

Result: 在Pascal VOC、COCO和VG-256数据集上，MAT-Agent分别取得了97.4、92.8和60.9的mAP，显著优于现有方法，并展现出加速收敛和跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MAT-Agent通过其创新的多智能体框架和动态优化策略，在多标签图像分类任务中表现出卓越的性能和适应性，为复杂视觉模型的优化提供了可扩展的智能解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

### [2] [CoIDO: Efficient Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning via Coupled Importance-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17847)
*Yichen Yan,Ming Zhong,Qi Zhu,Xiaoling Gu,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO是一种新型双目标框架，通过联合优化数据重要性和多样性，显著降低计算成本，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据选择方法在处理大规模数据集时存在高计算开销和次优数据选择的问题，CoIDO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: CoIDO采用轻量级插件评分器，仅需训练小部分随机样本数据来学习候选集的分布，从而大幅减少计算需求。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B模型上，CoIDO选择的20%子集在十项下游任务中平均达到了全数据微调性能的98.2%。

Conclusion: CoIDO框架通过联合优化数据重要性和多样性，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了模型性能的98.2%。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

### [3] [Pre to Post-Treatment Glioblastoma MRI Prediction using a Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17851)
*Alexandre G. Leclercq,Sébastien Bougleux,Noémie N. Moreau,Alexis Desmonts,Romain Hérault,Aurélien Corroyer-Dulmont*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种潜在扩散模型，通过预处理MRI和肿瘤定位预测GBM患者的早期治疗反应，为个性化医疗提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤（GBM）患者对治疗反应高度异质性，早期预测治疗反应对推进个性化医疗至关重要。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，结合预处理MRI和肿瘤定位信息，通过分类器无引导增强生成质量，利用生存信息（特别是治疗后肿瘤演变）进行训练和测试。

Result: 模型在140名GBM患者的本地数据集上训练和测试，成功生成治疗后MRI，反映了肿瘤演变。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的早期视觉治疗反应预测方法，通过预处理MRI和肿瘤定位信息生成治疗后MRI，为个性化医疗提供了新工具。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

### [4] [Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854)

Method: 使用五种基准嵌入模型处理多样化的AI和人类生成图像数据集，通过比较嵌入相似性来区分图像来源。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在区分AI生成图像和人类创作图像方面具有较高的准确性和鲁棒性，且对图像扰动的敏感性较低。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于嵌入的AI图像检测框架，通过图像嵌入和向量相似性来区分AI生成图像与人类创作图像。实验验证了该方法的鲁棒性，并展示了其在扰动下的稳定性。

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

### [5] [CMIS-Net: A Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network for Backchannel Agreement Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17855)
*Yuxuan Huang,Kangzhong Wang,Eugene Yujun Fu,Grace Ngai,Peter H. F. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMIS-Net通过多尺度个体标准化和隐式数据增强，显著提升了反馈信号检测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反馈信号（如点头、微笑等）在对话中至关重要，但现有方法多忽略多尺度行为线索的互补性，且受个体差异影响较大。

Method: 提出了级联多尺度个体标准化网络（CMIS-Net），在帧和序列级别提取个体归一化的反馈特征，并引入隐式数据增强模块。

Result: CMIS-Net在反馈信号检测中表现优异，有效处理了个体差异和数据不平衡问题。

Conclusion: CMIS-Net通过多尺度个体标准化和隐式数据增强，有效解决了个体差异和数据不平衡问题，在反馈信号检测中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

### [6] [Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858)
*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过速度场自蒸馏实现的高效后训练方法，将预训练的流匹配扩散模型转化为少步采样器，避免了重新训练的需求，并支持预训练阶段的直接整合，实现了高效少步流学习和少样本蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管流匹配中的捷径方法（如捷径模型）提供了灵活的轨迹跳过能力，但它需要专门的步长嵌入，且与现有模型不兼容，除非从头重新训练——这一过程的成本几乎与预训练本身相当。因此，本文旨在为标准的流匹配模型（如Flux）引入一种更激进的捷径机制，避免步长嵌入的需求，同时实现高效训练和高质量输出。

Method: 该方法基于速度场自蒸馏原理，通过在速度场而非样本空间中进行学习，并利用自引导蒸馏在线快速学习，从而实现了高效的训练。该方法无需步长嵌入，可直接应用于标准流匹配模型（如Flux），并在短时间内（如不到一个A100天）生成3步Flux模型。此外，该方法还能整合到预训练阶段，直接生成高效少步流模型。

Result: 该方法在短时间内（如不到一个A100天）成功生成了3步Flux模型，并实现了数十亿参数扩散模型的少样本蒸馏（如仅需10个文本-图像对）。实验结果表明，该方法在几乎无成本的情况下提供了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种超高效的后训练方法，通过新颖的速度场自蒸馏技术，将大规模预训练的流匹配扩散模型转化为高效的少步采样器。该方法不仅避免了重新训练的需要，还能在预训练阶段直接整合，实现高效少步流的学习，同时保持模型质量。此外，该方法还首次实现了数十亿参数扩散模型的少样本蒸馏，几乎无成本地提供了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

*Demetrious T. Kutzke,Ying-Kun Wu,Elizabeth Terveen,Junaed Sattar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于计算机视觉的伪IMU技术，用于水下潜水员异常行为识别，显著提升了安全监测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人类活动识别方法在水下环境中效果不佳，尤其是潜水员安全监测面临挑战。本文旨在通过技术创新解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的混合方法，利用计算机视觉从3D人体关节关键点生成高保真运动数据，创建“伪IMU”，绕过水下无线信号衰减的问题。

Result: 通过在水下自主车辆（AUV）上集成分类器并进行模拟紧急情况实验，验证了该方法的实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合计算机视觉和伪IMU技术，有效解决了水下环境中传统活动识别方法的局限性，显著提升了潜水员安全的监测能力。

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

TL;DR: InsideOut扩展了3D高斯溅射，融合RGB和X射线成像，解决数据差异和有限配对问题，提升多领域应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB和X射线成像之间数据表示差异和有限配对数据集的挑战，融合这两种成像模式在高保真RGB表面细节和次表面X射线结构之间的差距。

Method: 收集新的配对RGB和X射线数据，进行分层拟合以对齐RGB和X射线辐射高斯溅射，并提出X射线参考损失以确保一致的内部结构。

Result: InsideOut有效地解决了两种模态之间数据表示差异和有限配对数据集的问题。

Conclusion: InsideOut通过结合RGB和X射线成像，显著扩展了3D高斯溅射（3DGS）的应用范围，提升了在多个领域的可视化、模拟和非破坏性测试能力。

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

*Sungmin Cho,Sungbum Park,Insoo Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE是一个无需训练的零样本2D物体检测和分割框架，通过多视图模板和联合相似性度量实现高效匹配，并在BOP Challenge 2025中取得最佳成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决零样本2D物体检测和分割中的挑战，MUSE旨在提供一个无需训练的高效框架，能够在复杂场景下实现鲁棒的物体识别。

Method: MUSE利用从3D未见物体渲染的2D多视图模板和从输入查询图像提取的2D物体提案。在嵌入阶段，它整合了类和补丁嵌入，其中补丁嵌入通过广义均值池化（GeM）归一化以高效捕获全局和局部表示。在匹配阶段，MUSE采用结合绝对和相对相似性分数的联合相似性度量，增强了在挑战性场景下匹配的鲁棒性。最后，相似性分数通过不确定性感知物体先验进行调整以提升提案可靠性。

Result: MUSE在BOP Challenge 2025的Classic Core、H3和Industrial tracks中排名第一，展示了其最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MUSE 提供了一个强大且通用的框架，用于零样本2D物体检测和分割，无需额外训练或微调即可在BOP Challenge 2025中取得最先进的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image
generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition
architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现现有性别分类数据集存在交叉代表性不足，构建的BalancedFace数据集显著减少了分类偏差，为公平研究提供了资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有性别分类系统中的数据不平衡问题导致模型在性别和种族分类中存在显著偏差。

Method: 通过审计现有数据集，发现其存在交叉代表性不足的问题；构建BalancedFace数据集，通过混合FairFace和UTKFace的图像，并补充其他数据集的图像来填补人口统计空白。

Result: 使用BalancedFace训练的模型将种族子群的最大真阳性率差距减少了50%以上，并将平均差异影响得分提高了63%，同时整体准确率损失最小。

Conclusion: 构建BalancedFace数据集显著减少了性别分类中的偏差，为公平性别分类研究提供了公开可用的资源。

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

TL;DR: 研究评估了多种分割模型在人口统计学亚组中的表现，发现种族匹配训练数据可提高某些模型的准确性，而nnU-Net表现鲁棒。性别效应在偏置模型中与手动分割一致，种族效应则大多消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习分割算法在医学图像分析中取得了显著进展，但数据内在偏差（如种族和性别导致的性能差异）引发了公平性问题。本研究旨在评估不同分割模型在人口统计学亚组中的表现，并量化其公平性。

Method: 本研究评估了三种分割模型（UNesT、nnU-Net、CoTr）和一种传统图谱方法（ANTs）在MRI图像中分割左右伏隔核（NAc）的性能。使用包含四个亚组（黑人女性、黑人男性、白人女性、白人男性）的数据集，并利用手动标记的金标准分割训练和测试模型。研究分为两部分：评估分割性能和测量体积以分析种族、性别及其交互作用的影响。公平性通过设计的分割公平性指标量化，线性混合模型分析人口统计学变量对分割精度和体积的影响。

Result: 种族匹配训练数据显著提高了ANTs和UNesT的分割准确性，而nnU-Net不受人口统计学匹配影响。性别效应在偏置模型中与手动分割一致，但种族效应在大多数模型中消失。

Conclusion: 研究表明，种族匹配训练数据可以显著提高某些分割模型的准确性（如ANTs和UNesT），而nnU-Net则表现出对人口统计学匹配的鲁棒性。此外，手动分割观察到的性别效应在偏置模型中同样存在，但种族效应在大多数模型中消失。

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

participants watching up to 10 professional performances in randomized order
(94.6 percent watched >= 8; analyses focus on n=228). This addresses the
Western centric bias in affective computing. Three key findings emerge: (1) k
means clustering identified three distinct viewer types: High and Stable
Appreciators (72.8 percent, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2 percent,
n=30), and Variable Improvers (14.0 percent, n=32), with heterogeneity of
variance (Brown Forsythe p < 0.001); (2) individual level analysis revealed a
positive viewing order effect (mean slope = 0.488, t(227) = 5.42, p < 0.001,
permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor
classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling
found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables

Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving
student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net
(Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework
designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream
architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context
by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,
and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing
by offering a scalable, high-performing solution for real-world engagement

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在面对罕见、分布外的语义异常场景时表现脆弱，现有视觉语言模型的即兴提示方法性能不可靠且依赖昂贵的专有模型。

Method: SAVENT采用两阶段管道：结构化场景描述提取和多模态评估，通过四个语义层（街道、基础设施、可移动对象和环境）进行系统分析。

Result: SAVENT在真实驾驶场景中达到89.6%的召回率和88.0%的准确率，优化的开源模型Qwen2.5VL更达到90.8%的召回率和93.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: SAVENT通过结构化的语义分析框架，显著提升了自动驾驶系统中异常场景的检测准确率和召回率，同时解决了数据稀缺问题，为自动驾驶系统的可靠语义监控提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，HouseTour旨在通过结合3D相机轨迹和文本生成来解决这一问题，提升自动化视频创作的效果。

Method: HouseTour采用扩散过程生成平滑的视频轨迹，并利用3D高斯泼溅渲染新视角，同时将3D信息整合到视觉语言模型中以生成3D基础描述。

Conclusion: HouseTour方法通过结合3D相机轨迹和自然语言生成，显著提升了自动化视频创作的质量，适用于房地产和旅游应用，无需专业设备或技能。

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化图像生成模型缺乏对多源图像特定部分组合的显式控制，无需用户指定的掩码或注释。

Method: 通过构建一个包含464个独特（部分，主体）对的语义原子数据集，生成37k个提示并使用高保真文本到图像模型合成图像。训练了一个带有部分条件引导的自定义扩散先验模型。

Result: Chimera在部分对齐和组合准确性上优于其他基线14%，在视觉质量上优于21%。

Conclusion: Chimera模型通过结合不同源图像的指定部分并根据文本指令生成新对象，显著提升了部分对齐、组合准确性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

Motivation: 微塑料（MPs）的检测和分类因其微观尺寸而复杂化，传统方法效率低下，机器学习有望提升检测效率。

Method: 本研究探索了结合SEM成像和基于机器学习的物体检测技术，专注于具有对称重复图案的过滤场景。

Result: 研究发现YOLO模型在此任务中的性能差异，并强调了预处理优化的重要性。

Conclusion: 机器学习结合扫描电子显微镜（SEM）在微塑料检测中展现出潜力，但仍面临专家标注数据不足等挑战。

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT对高分辨率图像使用统一大小的图像块，导致输入序列过长，效率低下。

Method: APT采用多种不同大小的图像块，根据图像内容复杂度动态分配，复杂区域使用小图像块，均匀区域使用大图像块。

Result: APT在ViT-L和ViT-H上分别实现了40%和50%的吞吐量提升，训练和推理时间减少30%，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: APT通过自适应调整图像块大小，显著提升了ViT的推理和训练速度，同时保持了下游任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

Conclusion: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在3D重建领域展现出高效渲染和实时视图合成的潜力，尽管存在内存占用高、光照效果直接烘焙到表示中以及对次级射线效果支持有限等问题。

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

Method: 提出了一种在线上下文蒸馏（ICD）方法，通过稀疏演示将教师模型的知识动态传递给小模型，结合跨模态演示选择策略、教师测试时缩放和学生不确定性条件化等技术。

Result: ICD方法显著提升小模型性能（最高33%），仅需少量教师标注（低至4%），并能与教师的零样本性能竞争。

Conclusion: ICD方法显著提升了小模型在低资源环境下的性能，最高提升33%，仅需少量教师标注（低至4%），并能与教师的零样本性能竞争。

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: 本研究为推进交通系统中安全、可靠的语言驱动协作研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy
language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. Our project page is

Motivation: 解决现有评估方法碎片化的问题，重点关注WMs在具体任务中的实际效用，而非仅视觉质量。

Method: 使用World-in-World平台，提供统一的在线规划策略和标准化动作API，评估四种闭环环境中的多样化WMs。

Result: 研究发现视觉质量与任务成功无关，可控性更重要；动作-观察数据后训练比预训练视频生成器升级更有效；增加推理时间计算可显著提升闭环性能。

Conclusion: 生成世界模型（WMs）在视觉质量之外，其可控性和推理时间计算分配对任务成功更为关键。

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

Conclusion: VelocityNet通过结合头部检测和密集光流提取个体速度，并利用分层聚类和百分位数异常评分系统，有效解决了拥挤场景中异常检测的挑战。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: EMA-SAM通过轻量级扩展SAM-2，显著提升了超声视频中PTMC病灶分割的稳定性和准确性，同时保持实时处理能力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声视频中PTMC病灶分割因低对比度、探头诱导运动和热相关伪影导致的困难，以及SAM-2模型在动态视频中预测不稳定和时间漂移的问题。

Method: EMA-SAM在SAM-2的基础上，加入了置信度加权的指数移动平均指针，以稳定潜藏肿瘤原型在帧间的表现，从而适应探头压力和气泡遮挡等动态变化。

Result: 在PTMC-RFA数据集上，EMA-SAM将maxDice从0.82提升到0.86，maxIoU从0.72提升到0.76，同时减少了29%的假阳性。在外部基准测试中，EMA-SAM比SAM-2提升了2-5个Dice点。

Conclusion: EMA-SAM是一种轻量级扩展的SAM-2模型，通过引入置信度加权的指数移动平均指针，显著提升了超声视频中甲状腺微小乳头状癌（PTMC）病灶分割的稳定性和准确性，同时保持了实时处理能力。

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of
interventional ultrasound. Codes are available here \hyperref[code

TL;DR: VLSU框架系统评估多模态安全，揭示模型在联合图像-文本理解上的弱点，提供关键测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往单独处理视觉和语言输入，忽略了联合解释中可能的风险，即良性内容组合后可能变得有害。此外，现有方法难以区分明显不安全内容和边界案例，导致过度屏蔽或不足拒绝真正有害内容。

Method: 通过多阶段流程，结合真实世界图像和人工标注，构建了一个包含8,187个样本的大规模基准数据集，涵盖15种危害类别。评估了11种最先进的模型。

Result: 模型在清晰单模态安全信号上准确率超过90%，但在需要联合图像-文本推理时性能大幅下降至20-55%。34%的联合分类错误发生在单独模态分类正确的情况下。指令框架可将边界案例的过度屏蔽率从62.4%降至10.4%，但会降低对不安全内容的拒绝率。

Conclusion: VLSU框架揭示了当前多模态模型在联合图像-文本理解上的弱点和对齐差距，为研究稳健的视觉-语言安全提供了关键测试平台。

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成的去偏框架，通过表示分数和生成对齐策略，显著提升了对象检测中稀有类别的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法受限于样本的表示多样性，而简单的生成增强方法往往保留了需要解决的偏见。此外，仅为稀有类别生成更多数据是不够的，因为实例频率无法完全反映模型的真实需求，且当前的布局到图像合成缺乏生成高质量复杂场景的保真度和控制。

Method: 采用表示分数（RS）诊断超越频率的表示差距，并通过精确的视觉蓝图和生成对齐策略生成高质量、复杂的场景。

Result: 方法显著提升了代表性不足对象组的性能，例如大/稀有实例的mAP分别提高了4.4/3.6，且在生成图像的布局准确性上超越了先前的L2I合成模型15.9 mAP。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于生成的去偏框架通过引入表示分数（RS）和生成对齐策略，显著减少了对象检测中代表性不足的对象组的性能差距。

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

Method: DeepSeek-OCR由DeepEncoder和DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M解码器组成，DeepEncoder旨在高分辨率输入下保持低激活并实现高压缩比。

Result: 在压缩比<10倍时，OCR精度达97%；压缩比20倍时，精度仍为60%。在OmniDocBench上表现优于现有模型，且具有高生产效率。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR展示了在长文本压缩和OCR精度方面的显著潜力，特别是在历史长文本压缩和LLM记忆遗忘机制研究中具有重要价值。

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at

Conclusion: BlendCLIP通过有效结合合成数据和真实数据的优势，显著提升了零样本3D物体分类的性能，尤其在真实世界场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two

*Xueyi Chen,Keda Tao,Kele Shao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingTOM是一个无需训练的两阶段框架，通过Causal Temporal Reduction和Online Quantized Memory解决流式视频模型的因果性和累积性问题，显著提升效率并保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式视频语言模型面临因果性和累积性约束，现有方法仅调控后LLM的kv-cache，忽略了成本高昂的前LLM预填充阶段。

Method: 提出了StreamingTOM，一个无需训练、即插即用的两阶段框架，包括Causal Temporal Reduction和Online Quantized Memory。前者通过固定每帧预算和基于相邻帧变化及token显著性的选择机制，减少每帧的预填充成本；后者以4位格式存储token，按需检索并解量化，保持活跃kv-cache的边界。

Result: 实验显示，StreamingTOM实现了15.7倍的kv-cache压缩、1.2倍的更低峰值内存和2倍的更快TTFT，同时在无训练方法中保持SOTA准确率（离线基准63.8%，RVS 55.8%/3.7）。

Conclusion: StreamingTOM通过两阶段框架有效解决了流式视频语言模型中的因果性和累积性问题，实现了高效且内存可控的视频理解。

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

Method: 结合3D感知深度生成模型和2D肖像编辑技术，提出了一种高效的少样本身份保持属性编辑方法。

Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables
modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing
hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the
face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic
editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in
GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of
attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view
consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D
portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents
a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing
in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints
in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to
photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on
recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing
techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing
for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that
using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to
estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware
attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with
masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for
estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,
we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use
the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a
continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的单目深度估计方法在预测相对深度方面表现优异，但在绝对度量深度估计上因单图像尺度模糊性而面临挑战。

Method: 将深度估计重新定义为逆问题，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDMs）和基于立体的几何约束，学习尺度和偏移以实现准确的深度恢复。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在室内、室外及复杂环境中均达到或超越现有最先进方法，尤其在处理半透明和镜面表面时表现突出。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的解决方案，通过结合立体视觉引导和预训练的潜在扩散模型，显著提升了单目深度估计的准确性，特别是在复杂场景下。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

TL;DR: Med-RwR是一个多模态医疗检索推理框架，通过整合外部知识和视觉信息提升推理能力，并在不熟悉领域表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗MLLMs仅依赖内部知识进行推理，导致在超出训练范围的情况下产生幻觉推理和事实错误，且现有的Agentic RAG方法局限于单模态LLMs，忽略了关键的视觉信息。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段强化学习策略，设计了定制化奖励机制，以激励模型利用视觉诊断发现和文本临床信息进行有效检索，并进一步提出了置信驱动图像重检索方法（CDIR）用于测试时扩展。

Result: 在各种公共医疗基准测试中，Med-RwR相比基线模型有显著改进，尤其是在提出的EchoCardiography Benchmark（ECBench）上表现出了8.8%的性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RwR框架通过整合外部知识显著提升了多模态大语言模型在医疗领域的推理能力，并在不熟悉领域展现了出色的泛化性能。

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Conclusion: OmniNWM 通过统一的框架在状态、动作和奖励三个维度上实现了创新，显著提升了全景导航世界模型的性能，并在视频生成、控制精度和长期稳定性方面达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

Conclusion: ATED通过自适应令牌集成解码显著减少了大型视觉语言模型中的对象幻觉，提升了模型的鲁棒性，且不影响流畅性或相关性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

Method: 本文提出了ATTBHFA-Net，一种基于注意力机制的Bhattacharyya-Hellinger特征聚合网络，通过线性组合Bhattacharyya系数和Hellinger距离来比较和聚合特征概率分布。

Conclusion: ATTBHFA-Net通过结合Bhattacharyya系数和Hellinger距离，显著提升了Few-Shot Learning在灾难图像分类中的性能，并在多个基准测试和灾难数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in

View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent
images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning
solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV
2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce
a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven
initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

Conclusion: 优化视觉空间对零样本学习有益，提出的基于原型的方法达到了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize new categories that are not
included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential
ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on
learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and
visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.
Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by
deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the
discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure
unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows
semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this
work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual
prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,
so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature
instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the
visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method
we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that
is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make
the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual
space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype
based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: AV-Master框架通过动态建模时间和模态维度，显著提升了模型在复杂音频-视觉场景中的推理能力，并在多个大规模基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRO通过将偏好学习转化为排序问题，简化了训练目标，并有效结合了离线专家演示和在线策略生成的负样本，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

TL;DR: FeatureFool是一种无需查询的视频黑盒攻击方法，通过直接操作特征空间实现高效隐蔽攻击，适用于传统视频分类器和Video-LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击方法需要多轮交互和大量查询，不适用于现实场景和新兴的Video-LLMs，且视频领域缺乏直接利用特征映射的攻击方法。

Method: 提出FeatureFool，利用DNN提取的信息直接改变干净视频的特征空间，实现零查询攻击。

Result: FeatureFool在传统视频分类器上的攻击成功率超过70%，且能绕过Video-LLM识别，生成的对抗视频在SSIM、PSNR和Temporal-Inconsistency指标上质量高。

Conclusion: FeatureFool是一种高效、隐蔽的视频领域零查询黑盒攻击方法，通过直接利用DNN提取的信息实现攻击，无需多次查询，且在攻击成功率和视频质量方面表现优异。

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICA方法依赖单模态特征，难以捕捉与图像复杂度相关的感知表示，跨模态场景语义信息在ICA中的应用尚未探索。

Method: CM-SSA包含复杂度回归分支和场景语义对齐分支，前者在后者指导下估计图像复杂度，后者通过成对学习对齐图像与文本提示。

Conclusion: 提出的CM-SSA方法通过跨模态场景语义对齐显著提升了图像复杂度评估性能，与主观人类感知更为一致。

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

Conclusion: S2AP通过引入分数空间锐度最小化概念，有效稳定了掩码选择过程，提升了对抗性剪枝方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

Conclusion: BFCTN方法不仅实现了最先进的融合精度和强大的鲁棒性，还在复杂的实际场景中展现了实用性。

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管更大的ViT模型通常性能更好，但训练这些模型计算成本高且耗时。ScaleNet旨在提供一种经济高效的解决方案，通过扩展预训练模型而非从头训练来降低成本和资源消耗。

Method: ScaleNet通过在预训练的ViT模型中插入额外层并采用层间权重共享来扩展模型，同时引入并行适配器模块作为调整参数以优化性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，ScaleNet将DeiT-Base模型的深度扩展2倍，性能提升7.42%，且仅需三分之一的训练周期。该方法在图像分类和对象检测等下游任务中也显示出潜力。

Conclusion: ScaleNet提供了一种高效扩展ViT模型的方法，通过参数共享和调整参数的设计，显著减少了计算成本和训练时间，同时在性能上优于从头训练的方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild

interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,

Motivation: 现有的COD方法主要依赖图像级建模或标注优化，未能充分利用数据集级上下文信息或依赖繁重的标注工作。RISE旨在通过自增强检索范式解决这些问题。

Method: RISE 通过构建环境和伪装对象的原型库（无需标注），利用KNN检索生成伪标签，并引入Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR)策略和多视角KNN检索（MVKR）来提升原型库质量和伪标签的鲁棒性。

Result: RISE在实验中表现出色，超越了当前最先进的无监督和基于提示的方法。

Conclusion: RISE 在伪装目标检测（COD）中表现出色，超越了现有的无监督和基于提示的方法，展示了其有效性和先进性。

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to

global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of

Motivation: 现有的通过蒸馏整合Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)的方法存在根本性缺陷，会削弱与原始VFM的对齐鲁棒性，导致语义偏差。本文旨在绕过蒸馏，提出更直接的整合方法。

Conclusion: 通过提出的VFM-VAE方法和联合tokenizer-diffusion对齐策略，显著提升了Latent Diffusion Models的性能和效率，验证了直接整合Vision Foundation Models的优越性。

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

TL;DR: 研究开发了DWaste平台，利用计算机视觉技术实现边缘设备上的实时废物分类，测试了多种模型，发现轻量级物体检测模型在性能和效率上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着便利包装的普及，废物数量激增，高效的废物分类对可持续废物管理至关重要。

Method: 研究开发了DWaste平台，利用计算机视觉技术进行实时废物分类，并测试了多种图像分类和物体检测模型（如EfficientNetV2S/M、ResNet50/101、MobileNet、YOLOv8n、YOLOv11n），使用自定义工具Annotated Lab对数据集进行标注。

Result: 研究发现准确性与资源消耗之间存在权衡：最佳分类器EfficientNetV2S准确率高（约96%），但延迟高（约0.22秒）且碳排放高；轻量级物体检测模型性能强（最高77% mAP），推理速度快（约0.03秒），模型尺寸小（<7MB），适合实时低功耗应用。模型量化进一步提高了效率，模型尺寸和VRAM使用减少高达75%。

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了在边缘设备上支持实时、可持续的废物分类的'绿色AI'模型。

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

TL;DR: 将模板匹配问题重新定义为射线对齐问题，采用扩散变换器架构和几何先验，结合粗到细训练策略，在未见物体姿态估计中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模板的物体姿态估计方法因模板匹配失败导致姿态预测不准确，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于射线对齐的扩散变换器架构，通过重新参数化物体旋转和密集平移偏移来估计物体姿态，并采用粗到细的训练策略优化性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，该方法在未见物体姿态估计任务中表现出色，与现有最先进方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将模板匹配问题转化为射线对齐问题，并采用扩散变换器架构，结合几何先验和粗到细的训练策略，在多个基准数据集上取得了与最先进方法竞争的结果。

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

TL;DR: 该报告提出GBlobs特征描述符，解决了3D检测中的几何捷径问题，显著提升泛化能力，并在RoboSense挑战赛中取得最佳成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LiDAR的3D检测器在训练时容易依赖绝对物体位置而非形状和外观特征（即几何捷径），这导致模型在面对不同传感器布局时泛化能力严重受限。

Method: 采用GBlobs（一种局部点云特征描述符）作为网络输入特征，避免传统全局特征（如绝对笛卡尔坐标）导致的几何捷径问题，迫使网络学习更鲁棒的、以物体为中心的表示。

Result: 通过使用GBlobs，模型在多种LiDAR配置下的3D物体检测任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该报告提出的GBlobs特征描述符有效解决了3D物体检测中的几何捷径问题，显著提升了模型在不同LiDAR配置下的泛化能力，并在RoboSense 2025挑战赛中取得了最佳性能。

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

Motivation: 现有自动驾驶数据集缺乏可控、参数化和可重复的退化，限制了在明确定义的不利条件下系统评估感知和融合架构性能的能力。

Method: 引入Occluded nuScenes数据集，为相机模态提供完整和迷你版本，包含四种遮挡类型；为雷达和LiDAR提供参数化遮挡脚本，实现三种退化类型。

Result: 发布了首个多传感器遮挡数据集，支持在部分传感器故障和环境干扰下对感知模型进行一致且可重复的评估。

Conclusion: 通过发布首个具有可控和可重复退化的多传感器遮挡数据集，旨在推动自动驾驶中鲁棒传感器融合、韧性分析和安全关键感知的研究。

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

Motivation: 现有S2V生成模型在多主体一致性和背景解耦方面表现不足，导致参考保真度低和语义漂移。

Method: 提出了专用数据构建流程（包括低质量样本过滤和多样化数据合成）以及R-RoPE技术，用于处理参考图像。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Kaleido在一致性、保真度和泛化能力上显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: Kaleido通过专用数据构建流程和R-RoPE技术，显著提升了S2V生成的一致性和保真度，标志着该领域的进步。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

Conclusion: CovMatch框架通过联合优化图像和文本编码器，显著提升了跨模态对齐能力，在Flickr30K和COCO数据集上表现优异，仅用500对合成数据即可实现检索准确率绝对提升6.8%。

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在需要3D空间想象的任务中表现受限的问题，因其仅依赖纯文本或2D视觉线索。

Method: 框架分为两个阶段：首先通过监督训练将VLM生成的3D潜在表示与3D基础模型对齐，然后仅基于结果信号优化整个推理轨迹。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，3DThinker始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 3DThinker通过有效利用图像中的几何信息，无需3D先验输入即可在推理过程中实现3D思维，为多模态推理中统一3D表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

Motivation: 电子显微镜（EM）图像中的生物样本语义分割在生命科学中仍具挑战性，数据复杂度高，甚至人类观察者也可能感到困难。

Method: 基于分层变分自编码器（HVAEs），采用中心区域掩码、稀疏标签对比学习（CL）、高斯混合模型（GMM）先验和无聚类标签预测。

Result: 在2个密集EM数据集和荧光显微镜数据上展示了{\epsilon}-Seg的实证结果，证明其在稀疏标签下的有效性。

Conclusion: {\epsilon}-Seg在复杂生物图像数据上实现了具有竞争力的稀疏监督分割结果，即使在训练标签有限的情况下也表现优异。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

TL;DR: BQQ, a novel matrix quantization method using binary quadratic expressions, outperforms traditional linear methods in efficiency and accuracy, especially in neural network compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional first-order quantization methods in approximating real-valued matrices, BQQ explores the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions for more efficient and compact data representation.

Method: BQQ leverages binary quadratic expressions for matrix quantization, contrasting with conventional linear approaches. It was validated through matrix compression benchmarks and post-training quantization on Vision Transformer models.

Result: BQQ achieves better trade-offs between memory efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 2.2% and 59.1% on the ImageNet dataset under different scenarios.

Conclusion: Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ) demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness in matrix approximation and neural network compression, outperforming conventional methods in both memory efficiency and reconstruction error.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
matrix approximation and neural network compression.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于主动学习的新型交互式卫星图像变化检测算法，通过可逆网络增强显示数据，显著提升了变化检测模型的性能。

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

Motivation: 历史作者识别（HWI）任务由于手写风格的多样性、文档退化以及每个作者的标记样本数量有限，仍然具有挑战性。传统方法在小型精心策划的数据集上表现良好，但端到端方法在更现实的文档级设置中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 本文指出了构建稳健端到端系统的关键挑战，并提供了改善历史文档作者识别性能的设计选择见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

Conclusion: 论文提出的MoGA方法通过轻量级、可学习的令牌路由器实现高效稀疏注意力，有效解决了长视频生成中的注意力冗余问题，并在多种视频生成任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

Result: VC2L 在提出的基准测试（AnyCIR、SeqCIR、CSR）和现有数据集（M-BEIR、MTEB）上表现优于或与 CLIP 风格模型相当。

Conclusion: VC2L 展示了在复杂多模态网络文档中实现竞争性或更优性能的潜力，强调了统一、视觉中心方法在多模态表示学习中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出EMIM模块，将成本体积的运动建模能力整合到Transformer中，显著提升了动作识别性能，尤其在运动敏感数据集上表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的方法在场景相关数据集上表现良好，但在运动敏感数据集上表现不佳，缺乏精细的运动建模设计。观察到成本体积与自注意力中的亲和矩阵高度相似但具有更强的运动建模能力，因此提出将这两种优势结合。

Method: 提出显式运动信息挖掘模块（EMIM），通过滑动窗口方式从下一帧的查询邻域采样关键候选令牌，构建类似成本体积的亲和矩阵，用于上下文信息聚合和运动特征生成。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的数据集上验证了方法的运动建模能力，尤其在运动敏感数据集（Something-Something V1 & V2）上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的EMIM模块通过将成本体积的运动建模能力整合到Transformer中，显著提升了动作识别的性能，尤其在运动敏感数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型如Janus-Pro虽然能生成高质量图像，但因其大量视觉令牌导致高内存和计算需求，而KV缓存压缩在图像生成领域尚未深入探索。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的KV缓存压缩框架，通过将注意力头自适应解耦为两种类型：空间局部性头和语义汇聚头，分别维护短近期令牌窗口和紧凑的高关注令牌集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了5倍的内存使用减少和6.6倍的吞吐量提升，且仅带来极小的视觉质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应解耦注意力头，显著减少了内存使用和计算需求，同时保持了图像生成的视觉质量，使得在资源受限的硬件上高效自回归图像生成成为可能。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估描述的全面性，而忽视了遵循用户指令的能力，因此需要新的评估标准。

Method: 引入IF-VidCap基准，包含1,400个高质量样本，通过格式正确性和内容正确性两个维度评估视频描述。

Result: 评估20多个知名模型显示，专有模型仍占主导，但开源解决方案性能接近；密集描述模型在复杂指令上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 未来工作应同时提升描述的丰富性和遵循指令的准确性，因为专门用于密集描述的视频模型在复杂指令上表现不如通用多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

Conclusion: ColIAGS框架在结肠镜场景中实现了新颖的视图合成和精确的几何重建，显著优于现有方法，并显著降低了深度MSE。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

Conclusion: SEAL框架通过利用自然层次结构和跨粒度一致性模块，显著提升了广义类别发现任务的性能，并在多个细粒度和粗粒度数据集上达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

Conclusion: 基础模型为数据稀缺地区评估城市热岛缓解策略提供了有力工具，有助于建设更具气候韧性的城市。

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

Method: UltraGen采用基于全局-局部注意力分解的分层双分支注意力架构，包括空间压缩的全局建模策略和分层跨窗口局部注意力机制。

Conclusion: UltraGen成功解决了现有视频生成模型在高分辨率（1080P/4K）上的计算瓶颈，通过分层双分支注意力架构和全局局部注意力分解，实现了高效且端到端的高分辨率视频合成。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Conclusion: 提出的互补学习范式在HAD100基准测试中显著优于多个基线方法，证实了其有效性和通用性。

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at

Method: 提出Direct Perceptual Preference Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR)框架，利用混合奖励信号（结合全参考和无参考IQA模型）优化生成模型，并通过分层偏好优化自适应加权训练对。

Result: 实验表明，DP$^2$O-SR在扩散和流式T2I骨干网络中均显著提升感知质量，并适用于真实世界基准。

Conclusion: DP$^2$O-SR框架通过结合全参考和无参考图像质量评估模型，显著提升了感知质量，并在真实世界基准测试中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP文本编码器因输入长度限制和多语言支持不足，限制了其应用范围。直接对齐基于LLM的嵌入器可能破坏CLIP图像编码器的内在视觉-语言对齐。

Method: ProCLIP首先从CLIP的文本编码器向基于LLM的嵌入器蒸馏知识，随后通过图像-文本对比调优进一步对齐，并采用自蒸馏正则化避免过拟合。

Result: ProCLIP通过渐进式对齐框架，有效利用了CLIP的预训练知识，并实现了更好的视觉-语言对齐。

Conclusion: ProCLIP 提出了一种基于课程学习的渐进式视觉-语言对齐框架，有效解决了CLIP图像编码器与基于LLM的嵌入器之间的对齐问题，同时利用了CLIP预训练的知识。

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

Conclusion: GAR不仅保持了最先进的图像描述能力，还在多提示关系建模和高级理解能力上表现出色，甚至能够轻松迁移到视频领域。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器多为单一任务设计，依赖定制模块，限制了泛化能力并导致模型设计和参数的冗余。

Method: 设计了任务特定的提示符将不同任务输入编码为通用提示嵌入，并使用统一解码器将多样任务结果统一为预输出形式；引入了任务自适应内存机制来统一不同粒度的内存。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAM 2++ 在不同粒度的跟踪任务中均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAM 2++ 通过统一模型和任务自适应内存机制，在不同粒度的跟踪任务中实现了最先进的性能，建立了一个统一且鲁棒的跟踪框架。

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

Conclusion: M3Dphormer通过统一的分层掩码框架和双注意力计算方案，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，验证了其框架和模型设计的有效性。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

Conclusion: FedDEAP框架通过解耦语义和领域特定特征、双提示设计以及文本和视觉表示对齐，显著提升了CLIP在联邦学习多域场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

TL;DR: SeeTok 通过视觉文本和预训练多模态LLMs，替代传统子词分词，减少计算负担并提升性能，迈向更自然的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型（LLMs）依赖子词分词，将文本分割为固定词汇表中的片段。这种方法在高资源语言中有效，但在低资源语言中过度分割，产生长且无语言学意义的序列，并增加计算负担。本文挑战这一固有范式，提出视觉中心化的替代方案。

Method: SeeTok 将文本渲染为图像（视觉文本），并利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（LLMs）进行解释，复用从大规模多模态训练中学到的强大OCR和文本-视觉对齐能力。

Result: 在三种不同语言任务中，SeeTok 匹配或超越子词分词器，同时减少4.43倍的token数量，降低70.5%的FLOPs，并在跨语言泛化、对排版噪声的鲁棒性和语言学层次上表现更优。

Conclusion: SeeTok 提出了一种从符号化分词转向视觉阅读的新范式，为更自然、更受认知启发的语言模型迈出了一步。

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Motivation: 动态空间关系推理在现实场景中至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型和视觉专家模型在动态 3D 场景中的理解能力有限。

Method: 提出了动态空间智能（Dynamic Spatial Intelligence）概念，并构建了 DSI-Bench 基准，包含近 1,000 个动态视频和 1,700 多个手动标注的问题，涵盖观察者和对象的九种解耦运动模式。

Result: 评估了 14 个视觉语言模型和专家模型，发现模型常混淆观察者和对象运动、存在语义偏见，且难以准确推断动态场景中的相对关系。

Conclusion: DSI-Bench 揭示了当前视觉语言模型和专家模型在动态空间推理中的关键局限性，并为未来通用和专家模型的发展提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with
dynamic spatial intelligence.

Method: 通过虚拟现实研究，150名大学生参与者扮演校园枪手，模拟中自主机器人预测枪手行动并策略性地干扰和分散其注意力。机器人接近枪手的策略（激进或被动）和分散方法（低、中、高）被操控。

Result: 激进且高分散的机器人相对于无机器人对照组，减少了46.6%的受害者数量。

Conclusion: 研究强调了机器人干预在提升安全性方面的潜力，同时也提出了在学校环境中使用机器人所涉及的紧迫伦理问题。

Abstract: We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios
by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To
evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university
participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an
autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself
strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to
approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the
shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction
method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to
siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,
high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a
no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic
intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding
their use in school environments.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for autonomous goalkeeping with
humanoid robots in real-world scenarios. While prior work has demonstrated
similar capabilities on quadrupedal platforms, humanoid goalkeeping introduces
two critical challenges: (1) generating natural, human-like whole-body motions,
and (2) covering a wider guarding range with an equivalent response time.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on separate teleoperation or fixed motion
tracking for whole-body control, our method learns a single end-to-end RL
policy, enabling fully autonomous, highly dynamic, and human-like robot-object
interactions. To achieve this, we integrate multiple human motion priors
conditioned on perceptual inputs into the RL training via an adversarial
scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through real-world
experiments, where the humanoid robot successfully performs agile, autonomous,
and naturalistic interceptions of fast-moving balls. In addition to
goalkeeping, we demonstrate the generalization of our approach through tasks
such as ball escaping and grabbing. Our work presents a practical and scalable
solution for enabling highly dynamic interactions between robots and moving
objects, advancing the field toward more adaptive and lifelike robotic
behaviors.

Conclusion: 本文提出的CGVF算法通过解耦传播项的最后m个条目，并重新设计协调GVF算法，成功实现了多机器人在m维流形上的灵活空间排序导航。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of multi-robot navigation where robots
maneuver on a desired \(m\)-dimensional (i.e., \(m\)-D) manifold in the
$n$-dimensional Euclidean space, and maintain a {\it flexible spatial
ordering}. We consider $ m\geq 2$, and the multi-robot coordination is achieved
via non-Euclidean metrics. However, since the $m$-D manifold can be
characterized by the zero-level sets of $n$ implicit functions, the last $m$
entries of the GVF propagation term become {\it strongly coupled} with the
partial derivatives of these functions if the auxiliary vectors are not
appropriately chosen. These couplings not only influence the on-manifold
maneuvering of robots, but also pose significant challenges to the further
design of the ordering-flexible coordination via non-Euclidean metrics.
  To tackle this issue, we first identify a feasible solution of auxiliary
vectors such that the last $m$ entries of the propagation term are effectively
decoupled to be the same constant. Then, we redesign the coordinated GVF (CGVF)
algorithm to {\it boost} the advantages of singularities elimination and global
convergence by treating $m$ manifold parameters as additional $m$ virtual
coordinates. Furthermore, we enable the on-manifold ordering-flexible motion
coordination by allowing each robot to share $m$ virtual coordinates with its
time-varying neighbors and a virtual target robot, which {\it circumvents} the
possible complex calculation if Euclidean metrics were used instead. Finally,
we showcase the proposed algorithm's flexibility, adaptability, and robustness
through extensive simulations with different initial positions,
higher-dimensional manifolds, and robot breakdown, respectively.

Conclusion: R2BC方法在模拟和实际机器人任务中表现优异，甚至在某些情况下超越了基于特权同步演示的方法，证明了其在多机器人系统中的有效性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a natural way for humans to teach robots,
particularly when high-quality demonstrations are easy to obtain. While IL has
been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have
addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in
settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of
collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin
Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to
effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent
demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a
time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without
requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that
R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle
behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations
across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two
physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.

TL;DR: A soft, cable-driven gripper for gentle fruit harvesting, adaptable to different sizes, with low damage rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The labor-intensive nature of fruit harvesting and the limitations of conventional grippers (complexity, high energy consumption, lack of adaptability) drive the need for innovative solutions.

Method: The design utilizes 3D-printed TPU pockets with integrated steel wires, actuated by servo-driven cable control, enabling uniform pressure distribution and adaptability to various fruit sizes.

Result: Experimental validation showed a 0% immediate damage rate and less than 9% bruising rate after five days for tomatoes, confirming the gripper's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The drawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper demonstrates high suitability for fruit harvesting with minimal damage and bruising, offering a versatile and cost-effective solution.

Abstract: Fruit harvesting remains predominantly a labor-intensive process, motivating
the development of research for robotic grippers. Conventional rigid or
vacuum-driven grippers require complex mechanical design or high energy
consumption. Current enveloping-based fruit harvesting grippers lack
adaptability to fruits of different sizes. This paper introduces a
drawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper for versatile and gentle fruit
harvesting. The design employs 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)
pockets with integrated steel wires that constrict around the fruit when
actuated, distributing pressure uniformly to minimize bruising and allow
versatility to fruits of varying sizes. The lightweight structure, which
requires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to
other grippers. Actuation is achieved through servo-driven cable control, while
motor feedback provides autonomous grip adjustment with tunable grip strength.
Experimental validation shows that, for tomatoes within the gripper's effective
size range, harvesting was achieved with a 0% immediate damage rate and a
bruising rate of less than 9% after five days, reinforcing the gripper's
suitability for fruit harvesting.

Result: 研究发现，基于信息度量的排名筛选出的精简数据集不仅提升了学习任务的性能，还使学习过程变得确定性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，更多的数据并不一定更有利，相反，较少但信息丰富的数据可以加速学习过程，尤其是在涉及接触交互的情况下。此外，提出的度量方法可以为基于接触的机器人学习数据筛选提供初步指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the utility of datasets and whether more data
or the 'right' data is advantageous for robot learning. In particular, we are
interested on quantifying the utility of contact-based data as contact holds
significant information for robot learning. Our approach derives a
contact-aware objective function for learning object dynamics and shape from
pose and contact data. We show that the contact-aware Fisher-information metric
can be used to rank and curate contact-data based on how informative data is
for learning. In addition, we find that selecting a reduced dataset based on
this ranking improves the learning task while also making learning a
deterministic process. Interestingly, our results show that more data is not
necessarily advantageous, and rather, less but informative data can accelerate
learning, especially depending on the contact interactions. Last, we show how
our metric can be used to provide initial guidance on data curation for
contact-based robot learning.

Abstract: Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven
effective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and
time-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile
manipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two
high-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have
addressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations
in simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key
challenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)
positioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor
policies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data
generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints
(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during
navigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a
principled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four
multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates
significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this
diversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a
single source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few
as 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic
hardware. More details are available at our project page: momagen.github.io.

Method: 引入基于混合变换器（MoT）的视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型MoTVLA，结合预训练VLM的通用智能与领域专家的快速推理。

Result: 在自然语言处理基准、机器人仿真环境和真实实验中，MoTVLA在推理和操作任务性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoTVLA通过结合快速-慢速统一推理与行为策略学习，显著提升了语言可操控性和策略执行效率，在多种评估中均表现出优越性。

Abstract: Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining
momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite
promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language
steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant
inference latency when reasoning is incorporated.In this work, we introduce
MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA)
model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy
learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs
(serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding,
and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second
transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate
domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby
improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on
decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and
substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across
natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and
real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow
reasoning and manipulation task performance.

TL;DR: Coverage-Recon是一种新型协调图像采样算法，通过实时3D地图反馈优化无人机运动，显著提升3D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量3D重建需要从不同视角捕获关键点图像，而实时3D重建算法的进步使得在飞行中渲染动态地图并反馈指导无人机运动成为可能。

Method: 提出了一种名为Coverage-Recon的协调图像采样算法，结合了基于二次规划（QP）的角度感知覆盖控制器和NeuralRecon实时3D重建算法。

Result: 模拟和实验验证了Coverage-Recon的有效性，显示其在3D重建的完整性和准确性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Coverage-Recon算法通过结合在线地图反馈，显著提高了3D重建的完整性和准确性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: This article addresses collaborative 3D map reconstruction using multiple
drones. Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of
keypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage
control offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,
recent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to
render an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide
drone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated
image sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve
reconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of
drones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage
controller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety
constraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon
algorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are
interpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback
to update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The
effectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and
experiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that
incorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D
reconstructions than conventional methods. Project page:

*Alexandros Ntagkas,Chairi Kiourt,Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PGTT是一种通过奖励塑造强制步态结构的感知强化学习方法，在多种地形和平台上表现出色，比现有方法更稳健且适应性更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的感知强化学习控制器要么限制了动作空间并降低了适应性，要么无法预测后腿地形且对噪声敏感。PGTT旨在克服这些限制。

Method: PGTT通过奖励塑造强制实施步态结构，使用立方Hermite样条编码每腿相位，并根据局部高度图统计调整摆动高度，同时添加摆动阶段接触惩罚。策略直接在关节空间中操作，支持形态无关的部署。

Result: PGTT在MuJoCo中训练，在推力和离散障碍物上的成功率最高（分别比次优方法高7.5%和9%），速度跟踪性能相当，且收敛速度比端到端基线快约2倍。在Unitree Go2和ANYmal-C上的初步验证也显示了其有效性。

Conclusion: PGTT通过相位引导的地形穿越奖励塑造，提供了一种简单且通用的机制，适用于不同平台的稳健感知运动。

Abstract: State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged
robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the
action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability
across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate "blind", which struggle to
anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we
propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL
approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely
through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning
compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase
as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap
statistics and adds a swing-phase contact penalty, while the policy acts
directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in
MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and
domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances
(median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with
comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x
faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2
using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report
preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These
findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a
simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统验证中测试保真度、成本和可扩展性之间的权衡问题，以及缺乏支持严格定量分析的系统框架的限制。

Method: 提出了一个系统化的三阶段测试流程，围绕SOTIF标准设计，并实现了一个以统一时空测量核心为中心的HIL平台。

Result: 平台验证显示空间精度为10.27毫米RMSE，闭环延迟基线约为45毫秒。Autoware案例研究利用该平台量化了性能基线，并识别出在40毫秒注入延迟时的关键性能下降。

Conclusion: MMRHP微型混合现实HIL平台通过结构化流程和统一的时空基准，实现了自动驾驶系统的可重复、可解释和定量闭环评估。

Abstract: Validation of autonomous driving systems requires a trade-off between test
fidelity, cost, and scalability. While miniaturized hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
platforms have emerged as a promising solution, a systematic framework
supporting rigorous quantitative analysis is generally lacking, limiting their
value as scientific evaluation tools. To address this challenge, we propose
MMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that elevates miniaturized
testing from functional demonstration to rigorous, reproducible quantitative
analysis. The core contributions are threefold. First, we propose a systematic
three-phase testing process oriented toward the Safety of the Intended
Functionality(SOTIF)standard, providing actionable guidance for identifying the
performance limits and triggering conditions of otherwise correctly functioning
systems. Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a
unified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring
consistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through
comprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a
spatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of
approximately 45 ms. Subsequently, an in-depth Autoware case study leveraged
this validated platform to quantify its performance baseline and identify a
critical performance cliff at an injected latency of 40 ms. This work shows
that a structured process, combined with a platform offering a unified
spatio-temporal benchmark, enables reproducible, interpretable, and
quantitative closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for real-time human action recognition
in industrial contexts, using standard 2D cameras. We introduce a complete
pipeline for robust and real-time estimation of human joint kinematics, input
to a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network, for action recognition. We
rely on a new dataset including 11 subjects performing various actions, to
evaluate our approach. Unlike most of the literature that relies on joint
center positions (JCP) and is offline, ours uses biomechanical prior, eg. joint
angles, for fast and robust real-time recognition. Besides, joint angles make
the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to
anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and
subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model,
running also in real-time, along various metrics. It achieves 88% accuracy and
shows great generalization ability, for subjects not facing the cameras.
Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our technique, through
an online interaction experiment, with a simulated robot controlled in
real-time via the recognized actions.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的MPC公式，能够在现实假设下保证收敛到目标，填补了现有文献中关于非完整系统和非凸约束下输出跟踪MPC的理论空白。

Abstract: Motivated by the application of using model predictive control (MPC) for
motion planning of autonomous mobile robots, a form of output tracking MPC for
non-holonomic systems and with non-convex constraints is studied. Although the
advantages of using MPC for motion planning have been demonstrated in several
papers, in most of the available fundamental literature on output tracking MPC
it is assumed, often implicitly, that the model is holonomic and generally the
state or output constraints must be convex. Thus, in application-oriented
publications, empirical results dominate and the topic of proving completeness,
in particular under which assumptions the target is always reached, has
received comparatively little attention. To address this gap, we present a
novel MPC formulation that guarantees convergence to the desired target under
realistic assumptions, which can be verified in relevant real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present an online model-based reinforcement learning algorithm suitable
for controlling complex robotic systems directly in the real world. Unlike
prevailing sim-to-real pipelines that rely on extensive offline simulation and
model-free policy optimization, our method builds a dynamics model from
real-time interaction data and performs policy updates guided by the learned
dynamics model. This efficient model-based reinforcement learning scheme
significantly reduces the number of samples to train control policies, enabling
direct training on real-world rollout data. This significantly reduces the
influence of bias in the simulated data, and facilitates the search for
high-performance control policies. We adopt online learning analysis to derive
sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization
assumptions, providing formal guarantees on performance improvement as more
interaction data are collected. Experimental evaluations were performed on a
hydraulic excavator arm and a soft robot arm, where the algorithm demonstrates
strong sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning methods,
reaching comparable performance within hours. Robust adaptation to shifting
dynamics was also observed when the payload condition was randomized. Our
approach paves the way toward efficient and reliable on-robot learning for a
broad class of challenging control tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ObjNav代理依赖云端大型LLM（如GPT-4），而直接切换到小型LLM（如LLaMA3.2-11b）会因模型容量限制导致成功率显著下降，且导航地图的长提示会导致高规划延迟，阻碍本地设备部署。

Method: 提出了语义感知内存检索来修剪导航地图中的冗余信息，并采用离散内存缓存和基于注意力的内存聚类技术来优化KV缓存的保存和重用。

Result: 在HM3D基准测试中，EfficientNav比基于GPT-4的基线成功率提高了11.1%，实时延迟降低了6.7倍，端到端延迟降低了4.7倍。

Conclusion: EfficientNav通过语义感知内存检索和离散内存缓存技术，显著提升了小型LLM在ObjNav任务中的表现，实现了比GPT-4基线更高的成功率和更低的延迟。

Abstract: Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the
location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents
equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation
maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily
rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small
LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to
limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which
prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt
introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency
on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device
efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better
understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to
prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we
propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to
efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on
HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time
latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our
code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 通过优化控制障碍函数（CBFs）和安全控制的组合，提出了一种称为最小限制性超平面-CBF的方法，能够在保证安全性的同时尽可能接近期望控制。

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) can provide provable safety guarantees for
dynamic systems. However, finding a valid CBF for a system of interest is often
non-trivial, especially if the shape of the unsafe region is complex and the
CBFs are of higher order. A common solution to this problem is to make a
conservative approximation of the unsafe region in the form of a
line/hyperplane, and use the corresponding conservative Hyperplane-CBF when
deciding on safe control actions. In this letter, we note that conservative
constraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want.
Thus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with
respect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to
get as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety
guarantee provided by the CBF. We call the corresponding CBF the least
restrictive Hyperplane-CBF. Finally, we also provide a way of creating a smooth
parameterization of the CBF-family for the optimization, and illustrate the
approach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints,
moving through a group of arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles.

Abstract: Legged rovers provide enhanced mobility compared to wheeled platforms,
enabling navigation on steep and irregular planetary terrains. However,
traditional legged locomotion might be energetically inefficient and
potentially dangerous to the rover on loose and inclined surfaces, such as
crater walls and cave slopes. This paper introduces a preliminary study that
compares the Cost of Transport (CoT) of walking and torso-based sliding
locomotion for quadruped robots across different slopes, friction conditions
and speed levels. By identifying intersections between walking and sliding CoT
curves, we aim to define threshold conditions that may trigger transitions
between the two strategies. The methodology combines physics-based simulations
in Isaac Sim with particle interaction validation in ANSYS-Rocky. Our results
represent an initial step towards adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary
legged rovers.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect for building intelligent autonomous robots that can
assist humans in their daily lives is the construction of rich environmental
representations. While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched
robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between
spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event
washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a
framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This
representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex
spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's
capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human
inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种分布式MPC方法，用于多车辆货物运输，通过共享地图定位机器人，实现了高精度的路径跟踪和间距控制，适用于实际部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高自主货物运输中多移动机器人团队的精确性，尤其是在车辆间距离和路径跟踪方面，需要开发一种高效的控制方法。

Method: 开发了一种基于激光雷达教导和重复精确路径跟踪的分布式模型预测控制器（MPC），用于多车辆货物运输。该方法利用共享地图在无GNSS或直接观测的情况下定位机器人相对位置。

Result: 分布式MPC在名义性能上与更复杂的集中式MPC相当，且在近距离场景中表现优于直接测量方法。但在远距离偏移情况下表现较差。

Conclusion: 分布式MPC在实时性和操作灵活性方面表现出色，适用于实际部署，能够在各种条件下保持与目标的间距在20厘米以内。

Abstract: For autonomous cargo transportation, teams of mobile robots can provide more
operational flexibility than a single large robot. In these scenarios,
precision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this
motivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for
multi-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of
lidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a
Euclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature.
Our approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other
without GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized
MPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance.
The distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex
centralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between
the leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range
scenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility
provided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real
deployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km
of driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the
proposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying
to maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四足机器人在真实室内环境中进行语义对象映射的需求，提供可查询的全局地图。

Method: 通过整合距离几何与相机检测，合并同帧内的共置检测，并将重复检测关联为跨帧的持久对象实例。

Result: 在机器人测试中，生成的语义对象层在视角变化下保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该系统能够在四足机器人上稳定运行，生成紧凑且可查询的语义对象层，适用于室内环境。

Abstract: We present an online semantic object mapping system for a quadruped robot
operating in real indoor environments, turning sensor detections into named
objects in a global map. During a run, the mapper integrates range geometry
with camera detections, merges co-located detections within a frame, and
associates repeated detections into persistent object instances across frames.
Objects remain in the map when they are out of view, and repeated sightings
update the same instance rather than creating duplicates. The output is a
compact object layer that can be queried (class, pose, and confidence), is
integrated with the occupancy map and readable by a planner. In on-robot tests,
the layer remained stable across viewpoint changes.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理高维零和微分博弈时面临维度诅咒和收敛问题，MADR旨在通过结合MPC和对抗性学习来克服这些限制。

Method: MADR框架结合了模型预测控制（MPC）和对抗性深度强化学习（DeepReach），用于鲁棒逼近双玩家零和微分博弈值函数。

Conclusion: 本文提出MADR框架，通过结合MPC和深度学习，显著提升了高维零和微分博弈值函数的鲁棒逼近能力。

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability offers a framework for generating safe
value functions and policies in the face of adversarial disturbance, but is
limited by the curse of dimensionality. Physics-informed deep learning is able
to overcome this infeasibility, but itself suffers from slow and inaccurate
convergence, primarily due to weak PDE gradients and the complexity of
self-supervised learning. A few works, recently, have demonstrated that
enriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the
nature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and
solution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems
and simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial
DeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum
differential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding
optimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies
for worst-case robustness. We test MADR on a multitude of high-dimensional
simulated and real robotic agents with varying dynamics and games, finding that
our approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines in
simulation and produces impressive results in hardware.

Abstract: Global illumination (GI) is essential for realistic rendering but remains
computationally expensive due to the complexity of simulating indirect light
transport. Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization,
sometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward
cross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as
neural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view
inconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D
light transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from
3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each
scene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A
scalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these
features into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves
nearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent
features through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We
demonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse
indoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding
trained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks
with limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for
spatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how
the normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding. This approach
highlights a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines
without explicit ray-traced illumination cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模OD流数据分析时，传统的数据聚合和交互过滤方法可能会平滑或遗漏某些模式，需要更直观且可解释的工具。

Method: ORDENA是一种基于散点图的可视化分析工具，横纵轴分别代表起点和终点，每个OD流表示为散点图中的点。

Result: ORDENA在多个案例研究中展示了其有效性，并获得了未参与开发的领域专家的积极评价。

Conclusion: ORDENA工具通过直观的散点图布局和解释性资源，有效帮助用户理解OD流及其相关属性，得到了领域专家的积极反馈。

Abstract: Analyzing origin-destination flows is an important problem that has been
extensively investigated in several scientific fields, particularly by the
visualization community. The problem becomes especially challenging when
involving massive data, demanding mechanisms such as data aggregation and
interactive filtering to make the exploratory process doable. However, data
aggregation tends to smooth out certain patterns, and deciding which data
should be filtered is not straightforward. In this work, we propose ORDENA, a
visual analytic tool to explore origin and destination data. ORDENA is built
upon a simple and intuitive scatter plot where the horizontal and vertical axes
correspond to origins and destinations. Therefore, each origin-destination flow
is represented as a point in the scatter plot. How the points are organized in
the plot layout reveals important spatial phenomena present in the data.
Moreover, ORDENA provides explainability resources that allow users to better
understand the relation between origin-destination flows and associated
attributes. We illustrate ORDENA's effectiveness in a set of case studies,
which have also been elaborated in collaboration with domain experts. The
proposed tool has also been evaluated by domain experts not involved in its
development, which provided quite positive feedback about ORDENA.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于SDF匹配和自适应子空间优化的非刚性配准算法，解决了传统方法的局部极小值和参数敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NRICP算法存在局部极小值和初始条件敏感性问题，而现有SDF匹配方法也存在参数敏感性。因此，需要一种更鲁棒的非刚性配准方法。

Method: 论文将非刚性配准问题重新表述为SDF匹配优化问题，并引入平滑的Skinning Eigenmode子空间参数化方法，结合自适应子空间优化方案，以解决局部形变问题。

Result: 所提出的算法在非刚性配准任务中表现出比NRICP更高的鲁棒性，且避免了其他SDF匹配方法的参数敏感性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于SDF匹配优化的非刚性配准算法，通过平滑的Skinning Eigenmode子空间参数化和自适应子空间优化方案，显著提高了算法的鲁棒性，避免了传统NRICP方法的局部极小值和参数敏感性。

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is a crucial task with applications in medical
imaging, industrial robotics, computer vision, and entertainment. Standard
approaches accomplish this task using variations on the Non-Rigid Iterative
Closest Point (NRICP) algorithms, which are prone to local minima and sensitive
to initial conditions. We instead formulate the non-rigid registration problem
as a Signed Distance Function (SDF) matching optimization problem, which
provides richer shape information compared to traditional ICP methods. To avoid
degenerate solutions, we propose to use a smooth Skinning Eigenmode subspace to
parameterize the optimization problem. Finally, we propose an adaptive subspace
optimization scheme to allow the resolution of localized deformations within
the optimization. The result is a non-rigid registration algorithm that is more
robust than NRICP, without the parameter sensitivity present in other
SDF-matching approaches.

TL;DR: CAST框架通过激活流映射实现LLM行为转移，显著提升模型互操作性，性能接近完全重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM架构锁定问题，即特定任务行为被限制在源模型架构中，现有方法依赖脆弱的参数几何对齐。

Method: 提出了一种名为CAST的新框架，通过学习双向投影头将目标模型的激活流映射到源模型的潜在空间，并应用冻结的行为核。

Result: CAST在异构模型家族（如Llama-2和Mistral）间转移LoRA适配器时，性能达到完全重新训练的85-95%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAST框架通过激活流空间的直接映射，成功实现了LLM间行为的零样本转移，显著提升了模型间的互操作性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a
fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through
fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped
within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural
lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the
static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on
tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a
fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation
Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors
by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the
geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two
distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen
"behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection
heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source
model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.
This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,
effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We
demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA
adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model
families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve
85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,
quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and
establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多轮意图理解在任务导向聊天机器人中的重要性，实际部署面临严格的令牌预算和嘈杂的上下文，大多数检索流程强调相关性而忽略了集合级别的多样性和混淆因素。

Method: 提出了一个多样性感知的检索框架，选择上下文示例以平衡意图覆盖和语言多样性，并将此选择与标准LLM解码器集成。

Result: 在MultiWOZ 2.4和SGD上，该方法在相同令牌预算下实现了Joint Goal Accuracy的显著提升，超越了强大的LLM/DST基线，并在K从4到7范围内表现一致，延迟适中。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了内容多样性在检索中的影响，并提出了一种简单、可部署的选择原则，用于构建准确且预算受限的多轮意图系统。

Abstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet
real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most
retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity
and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval
diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent
understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval
framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and
linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders;
the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and
includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and
backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in
Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST
baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate
latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content
diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for
building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个仅使用LLM合成代理数据的统一框架，为开发具有强大工具使用能力的代理LLM提供了可扩展且无需人工监督的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to
decompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments.
Realizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data-structured
interaction records that couple user intents with tool specifications,
argument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting
such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
scale. We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only
LLMs, without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes
generation into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records
spanning task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural
language exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic
and semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment
across inputs, outputs, and tool calls. Beyond single tasks, there is support
for both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions, enabling the
construction of datasets that reflect the full spectrum of tool-use
competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework integrates
constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based
filtering. This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the
prompt design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable
pipelines for high-quality synthetic data. By providing a reproducible,
LLM-only alternative to manual collection, hence advancing the development of
agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in
mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent
systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM
agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or
rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but
less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems
as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the
quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is
crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant
role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement
learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent
collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback
mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the
debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the
agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical
reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting.
Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent
prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

Motivation: 为了解决复杂动态系统建模中对全局时间的依赖问题，作者提出了一种新的本体论方法，强调通过主体感知和固定事件来定义因果关系，而非时间戳。

Method: 论文提出了一个包含九条公理（A1-A9）的形式化框架，确保可执行本体的正确性，包括历史的单调性（I1）、因果关系的无环性（I2）和可追溯性（I3）。特别注重基于模型的方法（A9），通过模式验证事件、授权参与者，并自动构建因果链（W3）。

Result: 通过boldsea系统（一个基于Boldsea语义语言的工作流引擎）实现了理论构造，证明了该形式化方法在分布式系统、微服务架构和多视角场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于主体-事件本体的形式化方法，用于建模复杂的动态系统，无需依赖全局时间。通过boldsea系统的实现验证了其在实际应用中的可行性，适用于分布式系统、微服务架构和DLT平台等多视角场景。

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex
dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as
an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models
(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -
the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)
making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring
determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what
falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the
declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of
fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms
(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of
history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special
attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via
schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)
without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea
system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical
constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The
formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,
DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from
different subjects).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在代理工作流中运行时成本高昂，尤其是在处理长提示和丰富数据流时。CompactPrompt旨在通过压缩技术减少令牌使用和推理成本，同时保持输出质量。

Method: CompactPrompt首先通过自信息评分和基于依赖的短语分组从提示中修剪低信息令牌。同时，它对附加文档中的重复文本模式应用n-gram缩写，并对数值列进行统一量化，生成紧凑但语义忠实的表示。

Result: 在TAT-QA和FinQA等基准数据集上，CompactPrompt将总令牌使用和推理成本降低了高达60%，输出质量下降不到5%（Claude-3.5-Sonnet和GPT-4.1-Mini）。

Conclusion: CompactPrompt通过结合硬提示压缩和轻量级文件级数据压缩，显著减少了LLM代理工作流中的令牌使用和推理成本，同时保持了输出质量。该方法为更精简的生成AI管道奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation
capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic
workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We
introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt
compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first
prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and
dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation
to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to
numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations.
Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage
and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA,
while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time
compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the
groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

TL;DR: Planned diffusion 是一种混合方法，结合自回归和扩散模型的优势，通过两阶段生成实现更快的文本生成，在速度和质量之间达到帕累托最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理中的一个核心挑战是在生成速度与输出质量之间的权衡。自回归模型生成质量高但速度慢，扩散模型可并行生成但需要多次迭代才能达到相同质量。

Method: Planned diffusion 采用两阶段方法：首先生成一个短的自回归计划，将输出分解为较小的独立片段；然后使用扩散模型同时生成这些片段。

Result: 在 AlpacaEval 测试集上，planned diffusion 在质量与延迟之间实现了帕累托最优，速度比自回归生成快 1.27x 到 1.81x，而胜率仅下降 0.87% 到 5.4%。

Conclusion: Planned diffusion 提供了一种在生成速度和质量之间实现帕累托最优平衡的实用方法，通过结合自回归和扩散模型的优势，实现了更快的文本生成。

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off
between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce
high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can
generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same
quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the
model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller,
independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using
diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides
a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a
suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x
speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win
rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism
of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to
provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with
exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements,
state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy
of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally,
highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize
performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT
(SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome
this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the
seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods,
which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent

empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential

### [136] [Measuring Reasoning in LLMs: a New Dialectical Angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18134)
*Soheil Abbasloo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出SIEV框架，通过辩证法动态评估语言模型的推理过程，揭示了现有模型在推理能力上的不足，强调了过程导向评估的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估和基准测试仅关注模型的正确答案，而忽略了推理过程，无法全面反映模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出了SIEV框架，基于辩证法（thesis、antithesis、synthesis）动态评估语言模型的推理过程。

Result: SIEV框架揭示了即使在GSM和MMLU等饱和基准测试中，最先进模型（如GPT-5-chat）仍存在显著的推理缺陷，例如在GSM测试中得分下降40分以上。

Conclusion: 采用过程导向、哲学基础的方法能够对语言模型的推理能力进行更深入、更严格和更具区分度的评估。

Abstract: What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Most current
evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but
correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this
work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of
steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into
deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established
philosophical tradition: \textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through
thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a
structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics.
Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model
reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate
distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers
significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated
benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses
over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings
highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach
enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: PaDA-Agent通过评估驱动的数据增强方法，显著提升了小型语言模型的性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在部署成本和延迟方面具有优势，但在复杂任务中的准确性往往落后于大型模型，需要高效的数据增强方法来提升性能。

Method: PaDA-Agent通过从验证数据中发现失败模式，并制定针对性的数据增强策略，直接减少泛化差距。

Result: 实验结果显示，PaDA-Agent在Llama 3.2 1B Instruct模型的微调中，显著优于现有的基于LLM的数据增强方法。

Conclusion: PaDA-Agent通过评估驱动的数据增强方法，显著提升了小型语言模型在复杂领域特定任务中的性能，优于现有基于LLM的数据增强方法。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost
and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly
for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge
this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation
and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data
Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data
augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike
state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and
generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from
the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation
strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based
data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

Motivation: 当前基于文本推理步骤分析的方法可能会忽略细微的有害模式，或被隐藏不安全推理的模型绕过。因此，需要一个更精确的方法来监控和引导AI推理中的安全行为。

Method: 提出了一个句子级标记的数据集，用于在LLM推理过程中基于激活的安全行为监控。数据集包含带有安全行为句子级注释的推理序列，用于提取检测和影响模型激活中这些行为的引导向量。

Result: 通过提取表征，该数据集能够检测和引导模型激活中的安全行为，展示了激活级别技术在提升安全监管方面的实用性。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了基于激活级别的技术在提升AI推理安全性监管方面的潜力，通过提取既能检测又能引导安全行为的表征，填补了现有安全研究中的关键空白。

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought
reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual
reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by
models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset
that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM
reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level
annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or
speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for
detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset
fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning
holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring
could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within
reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting
representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model
activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for
improving safety oversight on reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于事件的后期分析和基于规则的ABM难以捕捉人类行为和社会互动的复杂性，因此需要一种更先进的模拟方法。

Method: 论文构建了一个LLM驱动的多智能体模拟框架，模拟消费者决策和社会动态，生成智能体能够交互、表达内部推理、形成习惯并做出购买决策，无需预定义规则。

Result: 在价格折扣营销场景中，该系统提供了可操作的策略测试结果，并揭示了传统方法无法捕捉的新兴社会模式。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体模拟框架，为市场营销策略的设计和评估提供了一种可扩展、低风险的工具，减少了对耗时的事后评估的依赖，并降低了活动表现不佳的风险。

Abstract: Simulating consumer decision-making is vital for designing and evaluating
marketing strategies before costly real-world deployment. However, post-event
analyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the
complexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an
LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and
social dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation
in a sandbox environment, our framework enables generative agents to interact,
express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions without
predefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the system delivers
actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns
beyond the reach of conventional methods. This approach offers marketers a
scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing reliance on
time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering the risk of underperforming
campaigns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在代码生成任务中因推理速度与输出质量的权衡问题表现受限，需一种高效采样方法以提升性能。

Method: 提出了Saber，一种无需训练的新型采样算法，结合自适应加速和回溯机制，优化扩散语言模型的生成过程。

Result: 在主流代码生成基准测试中，Saber平均提升Pass@1准确率1.9%，推理速度加快251.4%。

Conclusion: Saber算法通过自适应加速和回溯增强重掩码，显著提升了扩散语言模型在代码生成任务中的推理速度和输出质量，缩小了与自回归模型的性能差距。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising
alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent
advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,
the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger
structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off
between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the
code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads
to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce
efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced
Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to
achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.
Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation
process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is
established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated
tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks
show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over
mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%
inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work
significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code
generation.

TL;DR: AgentChangeBench 是一个新基准，用于评估代理在动态目标变化下的适应能力，揭示了高准确性背后的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界多轮交互中的目标变化是一个关键特征，但当前代理基准主要评估静态目标或一次性工具使用。

Method: 通过四个互补指标（TSR、TUE、TCRR、GSRT）评估工具增强语言模型代理在三个企业领域中适应对话中目标变化的能力。

Result: 评估显示，GPT-4o 在航空公司预订任务中恢复率达到 92.2%，而 Gemini 降至 48.6%；零售任务中参数有效性接近完美，但冗余率超过 80%。

Conclusion: AgentChangeBench 提供了一个可重复的测试平台，用于诊断和提高代理在现实企业环境中的韧性，揭示了高原始准确性并不等同于动态目标下的稳健性。

Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions,
yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot
tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to
measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal
shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation
through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,
Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for
wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.
AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each
designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this
setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured
by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$
recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and
retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above
$80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high
raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit
measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench
establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent
resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL后训练能提升推理步骤的局部一致性（trace coherence），但不保证最终答案正确性，需谨慎解读RL改善推理的声明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法通常对所有token一视同仁，且仅基于最终答案正确性或Pass@K准确率评估性能，但声称RL后训练改善了推理轨迹。这促使我们研究RL后训练对未被直接激励的中间token的影响。

Method: 使用GRPO算法和Qwen-2.5-0.5B模型在GSM8K数据集上进行实验，引入基于一阶逻辑（FOL）的trace coherence指标来评估推理步骤的一致性。

Result: RL后训练整体提高了trace coherence，尤其在基础模型失败而RL模型成功的问题上改善最显著。然而，RL提升的局部一致性并不一定产生有效或正确的解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究强调，强化学习后训练虽然提高了推理步骤的局部一致性（trace coherence），但这并不保证最终答案的正确性。因此，关于RL提升推理能力的声明需谨慎对待。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of
Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning
tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods,
however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for
token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on
final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL
post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our
investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which
are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup
using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We
introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture
the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We
distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former
implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of
errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence
with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the
RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without
necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial
distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee
final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL
must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence,
which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.

Motivation: 由于缺乏对AGI的具体定义，难以衡量当前专用AI与人类认知水平之间的差距，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于Cattell-Horn-Carroll理论，将通用智能分解为十个核心认知领域（如推理、记忆和感知），并采用人类心理测量工具评估AI系统。

Result: 应用该框架显示，当前AI模型（如GPT-4得分27%，GPT-5得分58%）在知识密集型领域表现优异，但在基础认知机制（如长期记忆存储）上存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个可量化的框架来定义和评估人工通用智能（AGI），揭示了当前AI系统在核心认知领域的显著不平衡表现，并量化了其与AGI目标的差距。

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This
paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as
matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To
operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,
the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects
general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,
memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to
evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged"
cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in
knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in
foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The
resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify
both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

TL;DR: ssToken提出自调制和语义感知的token选择方法，解决现有方法依赖参考模型和仅用损失信息的局限，实验显示其性能优越且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token级选择方法需额外参考模型且仅依赖损失信息，无法保留语义重要token。

Method: ssToken利用历史模型计算token损失差异作为自调制信号，并引入基于注意力的语义感知重要性度量，与基于损失的选择互补。

Result: 实验表明，自调制和语义感知选择单独使用均优于全数据微调，二者结合的ssToken取得协同增益，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: ssToken通过结合自调制和语义感知的token选择方法，显著提升了监督微调的性能，同时在训练效率上保持优势，超越了现有token级选择方法。

Abstract: Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as
a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong
empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key
limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,
and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot
well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based
metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and
Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible
history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,
which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively
select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess
loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further
introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,
orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic
information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across
different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated
selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,
while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further
surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance
improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型的‘反思’是否与人类的反思推理功能等效，尤其在开放性和规则约束的任务中。

Method: 测试八个前沿模型在一个简单、开放但规则受限的真实任务上，要求生成有效的科学测试项目并进行自我修订。

Result: 首次尝试表现差（平均约1个有效项目），反思后改进有限（同样约1个），且常重复相同错误，显示‘修正’主要靠偶然。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型的‘反思’功能缺乏人类目标驱动监控的功能性证据，可靠性能需要外部结构来强制约束。

Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them
mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints.
Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text,
but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work
on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make
'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We
therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is
open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce
valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.
First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean
$\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1).
Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of
constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production
of a valid item rather than error detection and principled,
constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection
deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'
show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks
functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans
respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are
instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external
structure that enforces constraints.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型代理在网络任务中的广泛应用，其带来的安全风险日益凸显。现有研究方法主要依赖手动设计的攻击策略或离线训练的静态模型，难以捕捉网络代理的行为模式并泛化到多样化的环境中。

Method: 提出了Genesis框架，由三个模块组成：攻击者（Attacker）、评分者（Scorer）和策略师（Strategist）。攻击者通过结合遗传算法和混合策略表示生成对抗性输入；评分者评估目标网络代理的响应；策略师从交互日志中动态发现有效策略并编译成不断增长的策略库。

Result: 实验表明，Genesis框架能够发现新颖的攻击策略，并在多种网络任务中持续超越现有攻击基准。

Conclusion: Genesis框架通过动态发现和进化攻击策略，显著提升了对抗大型语言模型（LLM）代理的能力，并在多种网络任务中表现优于现有基准。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks,
they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks.
However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing
red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or
static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying
behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across
diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous
discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,
a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and
Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the
genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates
the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist
dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles
them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to
enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web
tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently
outperforms existing attack baselines.

Abstract: Geospatial data offers immense potential for understanding our planet.
However, the sheer volume and diversity of this data along with its varied
resolutions, timescales, and sparsity pose significant challenges for thorough
analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces Earth AI, a family of
geospatial AI models and agentic reasoning that enables significant advances in
our ability to unlock novel and profound insights into our planet. This
approach is built upon foundation models across three key domains--Planet-scale

capabilities of our foundation models and validate that when used together,
they provide complementary value for geospatial inference and their synergies
unlock superior predictive capabilities. To handle complex, multi-step queries,
we developed a Gemini-powered agent that jointly reasons over our multiple

deliver critical and timely insights, effectively bridging the gap between raw

TL;DR: ShortcutBreaker通过低秩噪声瓶颈和全局扰动注意力，有效解决MUAD中的身份捷径问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类无监督异常检测（MUAD）需要统一模型，但现有方法存在身份捷径问题，导致正常与异常情况难以区分。

Method: 提出ShortcutBreaker框架，包含低秩噪声瓶颈（LRNB）和全局扰动注意力机制，以解决身份捷径问题。

Result: 在四个数据集上分别达到99.8%、98.9%、90.6%和87.8%的图像级AUROC，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: ShortcutBreaker在多个异常检测基准测试中表现出色，显著优于之前的MUAD方法，验证了其有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing
research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection
across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models
for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.
Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have
brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they
directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors
between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to
distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified
feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations
to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we
design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features
into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to
prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling
capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a
global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.
Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection
benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)
and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a
remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four
datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across
different scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中的幻觉和碎片化决策问题，提升LLM在复杂决策任务中的表现。

Method: MASMP框架结合状态机提示和记忆机制，通过自然语言驱动的状态机架构和轻量级记忆模块实现结构化动作与长期战术连贯性的统一。

Result: 在《星际争霸II》实验中，MASMP对最困难内置AI（Lv7）的胜率达60%，远超基线（0%）。

Conclusion: 本论文提出了MASMP框架，为实时战略游戏中的LLM智能体设定了结合神经与符号AI的新范式，显著提升了决策连贯性和性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes Memory-Augmented State Machine Prompting (MASMP), a novel
framework for LLM agents in real-time strategy games. Addressing key challenges
like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches,
MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify
structured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features:
(1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to
emulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a
lightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics,
priority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate
MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly
outperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs'
semantic comprehension while resolving the "Knowing-Doing Gap" through strict
state-action mapping, achieving both interpretability and FSM-like reliability.
This work establishes a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic AI in
complex decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自博弈框架在零和竞争环境中依赖对称性，无法适应开放式学习场景中的不对称性。人类教学系统中的不对称教学机制为人工系统提供了灵感。

Method: HAP 将教师-学生互动形式化为极小极大优化，教师生成任务，学生解决问题，双方通过对抗性动态共同进化。

Result: HAP 在多任务学习领域与现有最优基线性能相当，且生成的课程提升了人工代理和人类受试者的学习效率。

Conclusion: Heterogeneous Adversarial Play (HAP) 框架通过教师与学生的对抗性互动，实现了自适应课程生成，显著提升了学习效率，并在多任务学习领域验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Self-play constitutes a fundamental paradigm for autonomous skill
acquisition, whereby agents iteratively enhance their capabilities through
self-directed environmental exploration. Conventional self-play frameworks
exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach
proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent
asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional
frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to
individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge
resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms
within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate
curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous
Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework
that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein
task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through
adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ
static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a
bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task
complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental
validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework
achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that
enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results in medical reasoning

poor localization. To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical

fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective.

Motivation: 随着气候变化加剧，城市内涝对全球公共安全和基础设施的威胁日益严重，而现有监测方法依赖人工报告，无法提供及时全面的评估。

Method: 研究提出了Urban Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess)框架，采用半监督微调策略和链式思维(CoT)提示策略，利用基础模型自动识别监控图像中的内涝区域并生成结构化评估报告。

Result: 在视觉基准测试中，UWAssess显著提升了感知性能，并通过GPT评估证实其能生成准确描述内涝范围、深度、风险和影响的可靠文本报告。

Conclusion: UWAssess框架通过结合基础模型和半监督微调策略，有效解决了城市内涝监测中的数据稀缺问题，并生成了可靠的结构化评估报告，为城市管理和灾害响应提供了智能化的支持。

Abstract: With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly
severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing
monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide
timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban
Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that
automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates
structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we
design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for
data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks
demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based
evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual
reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.
This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception
to generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models
lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban

Motivation: 优化建模在各行业中的关键决策需要自动化，但现有方法要么依赖脆弱的提示，要么需要昂贵的重新训练且泛化能力有限。

Method: AlphaOPT采用持续的两阶段循环设计：库学习阶段从失败尝试中提取求解器验证的结构化见解；库进化阶段诊断检索偏差并细化存储见解的适用条件。

Result: 实验表明，AlphaOPT在更多数据下持续改进（65%到72%），并在仅使用答案训练时，在OptiBench数据集上超越了最强基线7.7%。

Conclusion: AlphaOPT通过自我改进的经验库，能够在没有标注推理轨迹或参数更新的情况下，从有限的演示和求解器反馈中学习，显著提升了优化建模的自动化能力。

Abstract: Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but
remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise
mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches
either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited
generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that
enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone,
without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated
reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual
two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts,
extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition,
explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses
retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored
insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently
from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually
without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights,
and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and
intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data
(65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest
baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only
on answers. Code and data are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在不确定性环境中的决策表现不佳，现有方法多关注LLM内部不确定性而忽视环境不确定性，导致在多步决策任务中表现不足。

Method: PlanU是一种基于LLM的规划方法，利用MCTS捕获不确定性，将节点回报建模为分位数分布，并引入UCC评分来平衡探索与利用。

Result: 实验证明PlanU在不确定性环境中的LLM决策任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PlanU通过将MCTS中的节点回报建模为分位数分布，并引入UCC评分来平衡探索与利用，有效提升了LLM在不确定性环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range
of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making
tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning
actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is
impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental
uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process
inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM
uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these
approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance
in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches
deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables.
However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that
require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM
decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures
uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of
each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles
to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation
during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity
(UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based
decision-making tasks under uncertainty.

Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖昂贵的外部模型或不透明的启发式方法，而本文转向模型的内部机制，发现复杂推理任务激活稀疏的专用注意力头。

Method: 提出 CircuitSeer，通过测量数据对稀疏、专用注意力头（核心推理电路）的影响来量化推理复杂性。

Result: 在 4 个模型和 9 个数据集上的实验表明，CircuitSeer 表现优异。例如，用其选择的 10% 数据微调 Qwen2.5-Math-7B 比全数据集训练平均提升 1.4 点 Pass@1。

Conclusion: CircuitSeer 是一种高效的数据选择方法，通过量化数据对关键推理电路的影响来选择高质量数据子集，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning
datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data
selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on
costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus
from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that
complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of
attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we
propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the
reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial
circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate
CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of
data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over
training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

Motivation: 为在多轮社交对话中提升LLM代理的适应性策略，尤其是在不确定性下的表现。

Method: 提出一个概率意图建模框架，用于多轮社交对话中的LLM代理。该框架维护对合作伙伴潜在意图的信念分布，通过上下文先验初始化，并在每次对话后通过似然估计动态更新。

Result: 在SOTOPIA环境中初步实验显示，该框架在SOTOPIA-All上总体得分提高了9.0%，在SOTOPIA-Hard上提高了4.1%，略优于直接观察合作伙伴意图的Oracle代理。

Conclusion: 概率意图建模框架可以促进社交智能LLM代理的发展。

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model
(LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief
distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual
priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each
utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding
for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.
Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent
improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on
SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and
slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.
These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute
to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

TL;DR: LAFA integrates LLM-agent-based analytics with federated analytics (FA) using a multi-agent architecture, enabling privacy-preserving, natural language-driven data analytics with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-agent-based analytics frameworks lack privacy protection, while federated analytics (FA) lacks natural language support. LAFA aims to bridge this gap.

Method: LAFA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with a coarse-grained planner for query decomposition and a fine-grained planner for mapping subqueries into FA operations. An optimizer agent rewrites and merges DAGs to improve efficiency.

Result: LAFA outperforms baseline strategies by achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive FA operations significantly.

Conclusion: LAFA establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural language input in federated analytics (FA) settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索当前视觉语言模型是否能够像人类玩家一样，将屏幕内容转化为精确的低级操作，并在需要时主动寻求信息。

Method: 研究团队引入了StarBench，一个基于Honkai: Star Rail的回合制RPG基准，标准化了八项战斗任务和两种控制模式的评估：直接控制和工具辅助控制。

Result: 结果显示，在直接控制模式下，视觉语言模型在感知到控制的保真度上存在显著差距，而明智的信息寻求与成功率的提高相关。

Conclusion: StarBench提供了一个可重复的基准，用于评估在真实客户端游戏中的多模态决策和信息寻求能力，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在直接控制模式下的局限性，并展示了信息寻求与性能提升之间的相关性。

Abstract: Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen
into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information
before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can
do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool
scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to
temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance -
remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark
derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies:
multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information
seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two
regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive
only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with
no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents
can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional
textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,
StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when
agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice
affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary
VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in
perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that
judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing
StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and
multimodal decision-making in real-client play.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前设备端虚拟助手（如Siri和Google Assistant）依赖僵化的开发者API，GUI代理作为一种替代方案因基准测试的不足而被低估性能，阻碍了其实际应用。

Method: 研究团队对AndroidControl基准测试进行了严格的净化流程，改进为AndroidControl-Curated，并在此基础上训练了新的模型Magma-R1-3B，仅使用了2.4k精选样本和60小时的H20 GPU训练时间。

Result: 改进后的基准测试AndroidControl-Curated上，最先进模型的成功率提升至75%（较原基准提升15%），新模型Magma-R1-3B在参数规模小200倍的情况下性能与Qwen3-VL-235B相当。

Conclusion: 研究团队通过改进AndroidControl基准测试为AndroidControl-Curated，并开发了新的SOTA模型Magma-R1-3B，证明了GUI代理的实际性能优于现有基准测试的评估，为设备端虚拟助手的发展提供了更准确的评估工具和高效模型。

Abstract: On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are increasingly
pivotal, yet their capabilities are hamstrung by a reliance on rigid,
developer-dependent APIs. GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent
alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor
performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at
around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world
use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the
benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl,
including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent
capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl
into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved
through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark,
state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15%
improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to
practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model,
Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an
H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters,
this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both
AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community,
encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model
capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual
assistants.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注算法在理想或默认配置下的性能，忽视了'调优潜力'这一关键方面。

Method: 引入Crucible，一个利用LLM驱动的多级专家模拟来调整算法的代理，并定义了一个形式化指标来定量评估其'调优潜力'。

Result: 实验结果表明，Crucible能够系统量化不同算法的可调空间，并在实际部署中验证了其发现。

Abstract: Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain

existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal

To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven,
multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized
metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate
Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic
control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a
real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible
systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms.
Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and
design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is

Method: 提出COUPLE框架，利用结构因果模型(SCM)建模价值维度的复杂依赖关系和优先级，并通过反事实推理生成符合目标价值的行为输出。

Result: 在两个不同价值体系的数据集上，COUPLE在各类价值目标上均优于基线方法，并提供了更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: COUPLE框架通过引入结构因果模型和反事实推理，有效解决了大语言模型在多元价值对齐中的复杂性和可操控性问题，并在实验中展现出优于基线的性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and
demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond
average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such
as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple
value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods
encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:
1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,
ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)
they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those
underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we
propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE
alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex
interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal
relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it
applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired
value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also
provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with
different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines
across diverse types of value objectives.

*Sarth Dubey,Subimal Ghosh,Udit Bhatia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个结合长短时记忆网络的水文模拟器，用于在数据不完整或延迟时保持预测稳定性，并在多种流域条件下测试其稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的水文和洪水预测需要模型在输入数据延迟、缺失或不一致时仍能保持稳定。然而，大多数降雨-径流预测的进展都是在理想数据条件下评估的，强调准确性而非操作弹性。

Method: 开发了一个结合长短时记忆网络和宽松水平衡约束的操作就绪模拟器，以保持物理一致性。五种架构涵盖了从完整历史到数据延迟和中断的不同信息可用性场景。

Result: 模拟器在美国最小管理流域训练，并在包括印度高度调节河流在内的5000多个流域测试，能够重现GloFAS的水文核心，并在信息质量下降时平稳退化。跨不同水文气候和管理制度的转移显示出性能下降但仍保持物理一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架将操作稳健性确立为水文机器学习的可测量属性，并推进了可靠实时预测系统的设计。

Abstract: Reliable hydrologic and flood forecasting requires models that remain stable
when input data are delayed, missing, or inconsistent. However, most advances
in rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions,
emphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an
operationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that
couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance
constraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum
of information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to
scenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of
robustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States
and tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in
India, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades
smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting
hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent
performance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and
human influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a
measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of
reliable real-time forecasting systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCIA-Nabla是一个端到端代理框架，通过代码优化和LLM驱动代理实现高效模拟器生成，在多个任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过将模拟器构建转化为代码实例优化，减少专家工作量，并将代码本身作为可训练对象，从而提升模拟器生成的效率和可扩展性。

Method: SOCIA-Nabla是一个端到端的代理框架，将模拟器构建视为代码实例优化。它使用专门的LLM驱动代理作为图节点，并通过工作流管理器执行代码合成、执行、评估和修复的循环。优化器执行文本梯度下降（TGD），同时保留人工在环交互以确认任务规格。

Result: 在三个CPS任务（用户建模、口罩采用和个人移动性）中，SOCIA-Nabla实现了最先进的整体准确率。

Conclusion: SOCIA-Nabla通过将多智能体协调与损失对齐的优化视图统一，将脆弱的提示管道转化为可复现、约束感知的模拟器代码生成，实现了跨领域和模拟粒度的扩展。

Abstract: In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that
treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a
textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph
nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis ->
execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient
Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec
confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the
trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption,
and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.
By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view,
SOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible,
constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and
simulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the
code soon.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从后训练模型中提取对齐训练数据的方法，使用嵌入模型而非传统字符串匹配，揭示了模型复述训练数据的现象，并探讨了蒸馏实践的潜在影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何从后训练模型中提取对齐训练数据，以提升模型的特定能力（如长上下文推理、安全性、指令遵循和数学能力）。

Method: 使用高质量的嵌入模型来测量字符串之间的语义相似性，而非传统的字符串匹配方法。

Result: 研究发现模型容易在后训练阶段（如SFT或RL）中复述训练数据，这些数据可用于训练基础模型，恢复原始性能的相当部分。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了从后训练模型中提取对齐训练数据的可能性，并指出这可能是一个被忽视的风险。同时，研究还引发了关于蒸馏实践下游效应的讨论。

Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of
alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model
to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,
instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on
memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction
through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for
our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model
can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such
as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,
approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative
estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial
artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily
regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or
RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a
meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a
possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work
opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation
practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,
distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's
original dataset.

Conclusion: QuantEvolve通过结合质量-多样性优化和假设驱动的策略生成，成功开发出能够适应市场变化和个性化投资需求的多样化交易策略。实证结果表明其优于传统基线方法。

Abstract: Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is
challenging, especially with increasing demand for personalized investment
solutions. Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while
preserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing
market conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that
combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy
generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor
preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return
characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also
integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the
strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach
produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime
shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve
outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a
dataset of evolved strategies to support future research.

Motivation: 解决MLLMs高幻觉倾向和脆弱线性推理过程在复杂任务中的失败问题。

Method: VAR框架将推理过程分解为可追溯的证据基础和基于搜索的思维链生成，并结合回溯机制进行自校正。搜索由多方面的奖励函数引导，包含语义和几何自验证组件。

Result: VAR-7B模型在幻觉和安全基准测试中表现优异，显著超越开源模型，并与领先的专有系统竞争。

Conclusion: VAR框架通过结构化搜索和自校正机制，显著减少了MLLMs的幻觉倾向，并在复杂任务中表现出色，尤其是VAR-7B模型在多个基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are
hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle,
linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address
these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel
framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a
reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key
stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)
generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.
The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and
geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not
faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for
our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution
with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B,
sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and
safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and
demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

Motivation: 通过结合数据和知识，提升树基模型在分类任务中的预测性能，并改进解释任务，生成更通用的解释。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在预测性能和解释大小方面对两种树基模型均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合数据和知识的新分类方法，能够提升树基模型的预测性能，并生成更通用的解释。

Abstract: We present a new approach to classification that combines data and knowledge.
In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly
with negations) from data. Those rules are leveraged to increase the predictive
performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a
classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding
explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more
general than those derivable without taking such rules into account.
Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration,
benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and
in terms of explanation sizes.

Conclusion: 论文通过比较抽象和结构化模型在表达不确定性方面的表达能力，为形式论证中的不确定性建模提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation is essential both
for practical applications and theoretical understanding. Yet, most of the
existing works focus on \textit{abstract} models for arguing with uncertainty.
Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of
studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground
the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and
premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion
of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the
presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the
expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with
uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks,
and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the
structured side.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统在处理复杂用户请求时，如何在广泛检索相关材料和限制检索以减少噪声和计算成本之间找到平衡的关键问题。

Method: 论文将查询分解和文档检索建模为一个利用-探索设置，采用多种bandit学习方法动态选择最具信息量的子查询。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在文档级精确度、α-nDCG和长文本生成任务中均取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 论文的主要发现是，利用排名信息和人类判断来估计文档相关性，可以在文档级精确度上获得35%的提升，α-nDCG增加15%，并在长文本生成的下游任务中表现更好。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by
decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for
each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting
informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving
broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting
retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query
decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting,
where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a
given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an
alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and
demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative
sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank
information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision,
15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of
long-form generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话式交互检索系统因缺乏明确提问策略而导致效率低下的问题。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）训练代理生成一系列二进制问题，以高效缩小搜索空间。

Result: 在结构化任务中表现与强基线相当，接近理论最优；在非结构化任务中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: SherlockLLM通过强化学习学习最优提问策略，显著提升了对话驱动检索框架的效率和效果，尤其在非结构化任务中表现突出。

Abstract: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it
challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While
recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,
they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most
informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a
dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy
via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated
dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of
binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our
approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks.
Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution.
On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and
approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging
unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines,
showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue
policy.

Conclusion: ALGOS系统通过结合遥感图像理解和严重性估计，为HAB监测提供了实用且自动化的解决方案，展示了在分割和严重性级别估计上的稳健性能。

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation
and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB
monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for
high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on
severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)
from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on
both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of
evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping
them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research
proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three
topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic
Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named
COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.
This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native
function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings
highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,
BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and
emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct
provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based
thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a
robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more
equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness
of the scientific ecosystem.

Conclusion: 论文通过研究随机顺序模型（ROM）中的随机位提取过程，探讨了随机化在线算法与确定性ROM算法之间的关系，并展示了其应用。

Abstract: Interest in the random order model (ROM) leads us to initiate a study of
utilizing random-order arrivals to extract random bits with the goal of
de-randomizing algorithms. Besides producing simple algorithms, simulating
random bits through random arrivals enhances our understanding of the
comparative strength of randomized online algorithms (with adversarial input
sequence) and deterministic algorithms in the ROM. We consider three $1$-bit
randomness extraction processes. Our best extraction process returns a bit with
a worst-case bias of $2 - \sqrt{2} \approx 0.585$ and operates under the mild
assumption that there exist at least two distinct items in the input. We
motivate the applicability of this process by using it to simulate a number of
barely random algorithms for weighted interval selection (single-length
arbitrary weights, as well as monotone, C-benevolent and D-benevolent weighted
instances), the proportional and general knapsack problems, binary string
guessing, and unweighted job throughput scheduling.
  It is well known that there are many applications where a deterministic ROM
algorithm significantly outperforms any randomized online algorithm (in terms
of competitive ratios). The classic example is that of the secretary problem.
We ask the following fundamental question: Is there any application for which a
randomized algorithm outperforms any deterministic ROM algorithm? Motivated by
this question, we view our randomness extraction applications as a constructive
approach towards understanding the relation between randomized online
algorithms and deterministic ROM algorithms.

Abstract: We investigate the computational efficiency of agnostic learning for several
fundamental geometric concept classes in the plane. While the sample complexity
of agnostic learning is well understood, its time complexity has received much
less attention. We study the class of triangles and, more generally, the class
of convex polygons with $k$ vertices for small $k$, as well as the class of
convex sets in a square. We present a proper agnostic learner for the class of
triangles that has optimal sample complexity and runs in time $\tilde
O({\epsilon^{-6}})$, improving on the algorithm of Dobkin and Gunopulos (COLT
`95) that runs in time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-10}})$. For 4-gons and 5-gons, we
improve the running time from $O({\epsilon^{-12}})$, achieved by Fischer and
Kwek (eCOLT `96), to $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-8}})$ and $\tilde
O({\epsilon^{-10}})$, respectively.
  We also design a proper agnostic learner for convex sets under the uniform
distribution over a square with running time $\tilde O({\epsilon^{-5}})$,
improving on the previous $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-8})$ bound at the cost of
slightly higher sample complexity. Notably, agnostic learning of convex sets in
$[0,1]^2$ under general distributions is impossible because this concept class
has infinite VC-dimension. Our agnostic learners use data structures and
algorithms from computational geometry and their analysis relies on tools from
geometry and probabilistic combinatorics. Because our learners are proper, they
yield tolerant property testers with matching running times. Our results raise
a fundamental question of whether a gap between the sample and time complexity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决服务中心选址问题，确保没有大邻域被排除在服务之外，同时减少距离支配问题中的冗余。

Method: 基于图论中的k-组件顺序连通性和距离-l支配概念，开发了一种二次复杂度的算法。

Result: 算法成功找到了树的最小故障集基数，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种二次复杂度算法，用于确定树的最小故障集基数，解决了服务中心选址等问题，同时减少了距离支配问题中的冗余。

Abstract: Expanding on the graph theoretic ideas of k-component order connectivity and
distance-l domination, we present a quadratic-complexity algorithm that finds a
tree's minimum failure-set cardinality, i.e., the minimum cardinality any
subset of the tree's vertices must have so that all clusters of vertices
further away than some l do not exceed a cardinality threshold. Applications of
solutions to the expanded problems include choosing service center locations so
that no large neighborhoods are excluded from service, while reducing the
redundancy inherent in distance domination problems.

TL;DR: LHF是一种新型数据结构，通过多级去重和高效操作，显著提升了程序分析的效率和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在程序分析和优化中，传统方法存在大量冗余数据传播和重复计算的问题，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出了一种名为LatticeHashForest（LHF）的新型数据结构，支持高效存储和操作大规模聚合结构，并通过多级去重机制减少嵌套计算需求。

Result: LHF在指针分析中实现了内存使用几乎可以忽略不计的减少，并在输入规模接近1000万时，速度提升超过4倍。

Conclusion: LatticeHashForest（LHF）作为一种新颖的通用数据结构，显著减少了冗余计算和重复数据，在指针分析等场景中实现了内存使用的大幅降低和速度提升。

Abstract: Analysis of entire programs as a single unit, or whole-program analysis,
involves propagation of large amounts of information through the control flow
of the program. This is especially true for pointer analysis, where, unless
significant compromises are made in the precision of the analysis, there is a
combinatorial blowup of information. One of the key problems we observed in our
own efforts is that a lot of duplicate data was being propagated, and many
low-level data structure operations were repeated a large number of times.
  We present what we consider to be a novel and generic data structure,
LatticeHashForest (LHF), to store and operate on such information in a manner
that eliminates a majority of redundant computations and duplicate data in
scenarios similar to those encountered in compilers and program optimization.
LHF differs from similar work in this vein, such as hash-consing, ZDDs, and
BDDs, by not only providing a way to efficiently operate on large, aggregate
structures, but also modifying the elements of such structures in a manner that
they can be deduplicated immediately. LHF also provides a way to perform a
nested construction of elements such that they can be deduplicated at multiple
levels, cutting down the need for additional, nested computations.
  We provide a detailed structural description, along with an abstract model of
this data structure. An entire C++ implementation of LHF is provided as an
artifact along with evaluations of LHF using examples and benchmark programs.
We also supply API documentation and a user manual for users to make
independent applications of LHF. Our main use case in the realm of pointer
analysis shows memory usage reduction to an almost negligible fraction, and
speedups beyond 4x for input sizes approaching 10 million when compared to
other implementations.

*William Kuszmaul,Jingxun Liang,Renfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文解决了动态过滤器空间下界的最优性问题，证明其与指纹技术的空间下界相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态过滤器是支持近似成员查询的数据结构，但长期以来，其空间下界是否最优一直是未解的核心问题。

Method: 通过理论分析和证明，论文展示了无论操作时间如何，动态过滤器所需的空间下界与指纹技术所需的空间下界相同。

Result: 论文证明了动态过滤器在ε=o(1)时的空间下界为n log ε^{-1} + n log e - o(n)位。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了动态过滤器在ε=o(1)时的空间下界为n log ε^{-1} + n log e - o(n)位，解决了这一领域长期存在的核心开放性问题。

Abstract: Dynamic filters are data structures supporting approximate membership queries
to a dynamic set $S$ of $n$ keys, allowing a small false-positive error rate
$\varepsilon$, under insertions and deletions to the set $S$. Essentially all
known constructions for dynamic filters use a technique known as
fingerprinting. This technique, which was first introduced by Carter et al. in
1978, inherently requires $$\log \binom{n \varepsilon^{-1}}{n} = n \log
\varepsilon^{-1} + n \log e - o(n)$$ bits of space when $\varepsilon = o(1)$.
Whether or not this bound is optimal for all dynamic filters (rather than just
for fingerprint filters) has remained for decades as one of the central open
questions in the area. We resolve this question by proving a sharp lower bound
of $n \log \varepsilon^{-1} + n \log e - o(n)$ bits for $\varepsilon = o(1)$,
regardless of operation time.

*Harry Buhrman,Sevag Gharibian,Zeph Landau,François Le Gall,Norbert Schuch,Suguru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种更快的简单随机采样算法，用于MAX-k-SAT的$(1-\varepsilon)$-近似，并证明了其效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在证明一种更简单的方法在MAX-k-SAT（或更一般的MAXCSP实例）中的效率，通过展示大量赋值满足接近最优值的子句比例。

Method: 该算法通过重复均匀随机采样赋值，直到找到一个满足足够大比例子句的赋值。

Result: 证明了在任何MAX-k-SAT实例（或更一般的MAXCSP实例）中，存在指数数量的赋值满足接近最优值的子句比例。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种极其简单的多项式空间指数时间$(1-\varepsilon)$-近似算法，用于解决MAX-k-SAT问题，该算法比之前已知的多项式空间$(1-\varepsilon)$-近似算法（Hirsch, 2003; Escoffier等, 2014）稍快。

Abstract: We present an extremely simple polynomial-space exponential-time
$(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for MAX-k-SAT that is (slightly)
faster than the previous known polynomial-space $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithms by Hirsch (Discrete Applied Mathematics, 2003) and Escoffier,
Paschos and Tourniaire (Theoretical Computer Science, 2014). Our algorithm
repeatedly samples an assignment uniformly at random until finding an
assignment that satisfies a large enough fraction of clauses. Surprisingly, we
can show the efficiency of this simpler approach by proving that in any
instance of MAX-k-SAT (or more generally any instance of MAXCSP), an
exponential number of assignments satisfy a fraction of clauses close to the
optimal value.

Conclusion: 该论文为图着色问题在流模型中的研究奠定了基础，通过建立关键变体的空间复杂度上下界，揭示了在不同流模型（对抗、随机顺序、动态）下的性能差异。

Abstract: We study graph coloring problems in the streaming model, where the goal is to
process an $n$-vertex graph whose edges arrive in a stream, using a limited
space that is smaller than the trivial $O(n^2)$ bound. While prior work has
largely focused on coloring graphs with a large number of colors, we explore
the opposite end of the spectrum: deciding whether the input graph can be
colored using only a few, say, a constant number of colors. We are interested
in each of the adversarial, random order, or dynamic streams.
  Our work lays the foundation for this new direction by establishing upper and
lower bounds on space complexity of key variants of the problem. Some of our
main results include:
  - Adversarial: for distinguishing between $q$- vs $2^{\Omega(q)}$-colorable
graphs, lower bounds of $n^{2-o(1)}$ space for $q$ up to
$(\log{n})^{1/2-o(1)}$, and $n^{1+\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ space for $q$ further
up to $(\log{n})^{1-o(1)}$.
  - Random order: for distinguishing between $q$- vs $q^t$-colorable graphs for
$q,t \geq 2$, an upper bound of $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/t})$ space. Specifically,
distinguishing between $q$-colorable graphs vs ones that are not even
poly$(q)$-colorable can be done in $n^{1+o(1)}$ space unlike in adversarial
streams. Although, distinguishing between $q$-colorable vs
$\Omega(q^2)$-colorable graphs requires $\Omega(n^2)$ space even in random
order streams for constant $q$.
  - Dynamic: for distinguishing between $q$- vs $q \cdot t$-colorable graphs
for any $q \geq 3$ and $t \geq 1$, nearly optimal upper and lower bounds of
$\tilde{\Theta}(n^2/t^2)$ space.
  We develop several new technical tools along the way: cluster packing graphs,
a generalization of Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi graphs; a player elimination framework
based on cluster packing graphs; and new edge and vertex sampling lemmas
tailored to graph coloring.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种在插入数据流中进行图和超图稀疏化的高效算法，实现了与最优离线算法相当的样本复杂度，并在空间复杂度上有所改进。

Abstract: We study the problem of graph and hypergraph sparsification in insertion-only
data streams. The input is a hypergraph $H=(V, E, w)$ with $n$ nodes, $m$
hyperedges, and rank $r$, and the goal is to compute a hypergraph $\widehat{H}$
that preserves the energy of each vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ in $H$, up to a
small multiplicative error. In this paper, we give a streaming algorithm that
achieves a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation, using $\frac{rn}{\varepsilon^2}
\log^2 n \log r \cdot\text{poly}(\log \log m)$ bits of space, matching the
sample complexity of the best known offline algorithm up to $\text{poly}(\log
\log m)$ factors. Our approach also provides a streaming algorithm for graph
sparsification that achieves a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation, using
$\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2} \log n \cdot\text{poly}(\log\log n)$ bits of space,
improving the current bound by $\log n$ factors. Furthermore, we give a
space-efficient streaming algorithm for min-cut approximation. Along the way,
we present an online algorithm for $(1+\varepsilon)$-hypergraph sparsification,
which is optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors. As a result, we achieve
$(1+\varepsilon)$-hypergraph sparsification in the sliding window model, with
space optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors. Lastly, we give an adversarially
robust algorithm for hypergraph sparsification using $\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2}
\cdot\text{poly}(r, \log n, \log r, \log \log m)$ bits of space.

*Yang Hu,William Kuszmaul,Jingxun Liang,Huacheng Yu,Junkai Zhang,Renfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了静态检索问题的时间与空间权衡，证明了大值情况下无法同时实现最优时间和空间，但提出了一种结合其他数据结构的优化方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态检索问题在信息检索中具有广泛应用，但在大值情况下，时间与空间的最优平衡尚未解决。本文旨在填补这一理论空白，并提供实际可行的解决方案。

Method: 本文采用了理论分析和构造性证明方法，首先通过下界分析证明了在大值情况下时间与空间的不可兼得性，随后提出了一种结合其他数据结构的优化方案。

Result: 本文证明了在大值情况下（如v=Θ(log n)），无法同时实现O(1)查询时间和nv+o(n)比特的空间。同时，提出了一种结合其他数据结构的方案，能够在保持查询效率的同时，显著降低总空间开销。

Conclusion: 本文通过严格的上下界分析，揭示了静态检索问题中时间与空间之间的显著权衡。特别是在大值情况下，无法同时实现O(1)查询时间和低冗余空间。然而，通过与其他数据结构结合，可以部分缓解这一问题。

Abstract: In the static retrieval problem, a data structure must answer retrieval
queries mapping a set of $n$ keys in a universe $[U]$ to $v$-bit values.
Information-theoretically, retrieval data structures can use as little as $nv$
bits of space. For small value sizes $v$, it is possible to achieve $O(1)$
query time while using space $nv + o(n)$ bits -- whether or not such a result
is possible for larger values of $v$ (e.g., $v = \Theta(\log n)$) has remained
open.
  In this paper, we obtain a tight lower bound (as well as matching upper
bounds) for the static retrieval problem. In the case where values are large,
we show that there is actually a significant tension between time and space. It
is not possible, for example, to get $O(1)$ query time using $nv + o(n)$ bits
of space, when $v = \Theta(\log n)$ (and assuming the word RAM model with
$O(\log n)$-bit words).
  At first glance, our lower bound would seem to render retrieval unusable in
many settings that aim to achieve very low redundancy. However, our second
result offers a way around this: We show that, whenever a retrieval data
structure $D_1$ is stored along with another data structure $D_2$ (whose size
is similar to or larger than the size of $D_1$), it is possible to implement
the combined data structure $D_1 \cup D_2$ so that queries to $D_1$ take $O(1)$
time, operations on $D_2$ take the same asymptotic time as if $D_2$ were stored
on its own, and the total space is $nv + \mathrm{Space}(D_2) + n^{0.67}$ bits.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的随机算法，降低了割查询复杂度，并通过递归贪心方法实现。同时，提出了一种确定性通信协议，进一步优化了通信复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通过割查询模型计算无权重无向图中的最小$s$-$t$割问题，旨在避免$\widetilde{\Theta}(n^2)$查询的复杂度。

Method: 采用了一种查询高效的子程序，逐步揭示图的边，同时在学习的子图中以比传统增广路径方法更快的速度增加最大$s$-$t$流。算法是简单、纯粹组合的，并可自然解释为递归贪心过程。

Result: 提出的随机算法将割查询复杂度从$\widetilde{O}(n^{5/3})$改进到$\widetilde{O}(n^{8/5})$，并提出了通信复杂度为$\widetilde{O}(n^{11/7})$的确定性两方通信协议。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的随机算法，将割查询复杂度降低到$\widetilde{O}(n^{8/5})$，并通过递归贪心方法实现了这一改进。此外，还提出了一种确定性和组合性的两方通信协议，将通信复杂度提高到$\widetilde{O}(n^{11/7})$。

Abstract: We study the problem of computing a minimum $s$--$t$ cut in an unweighted,
undirected graph via \emph{cut queries}. In this model, the input graph is
accessed through an oracle that, given a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$,
returns the size of the cut $(S, V \setminus S)$.
  This line of work was initiated by Rubinstein, Schramm, and Weinberg (ITCS
2018), who gave a randomized algorithm that computes a minimum $s$--$t$ cut
using $\widetilde{O}(n^{5/3})$ queries, thereby showing that one can avoid
spending $\widetilde{\Theta}(n^2)$ queries required to learn the entire graph.
A recent result by Anand, Saranurak, and Wang (SODA 2025) also matched this
upper bound via a deterministic algorithm based on blocking flows.
  In this work, we present a new randomized algorithm that improves the
cut-query complexity to $\widetilde{O}(n^{8/5})$. At the heart of our approach
is a query-efficient subroutine that incrementally reveals the graph
edge-by-edge while increasing the maximum $s$--$t$ flow in the learned subgraph
at a rate faster than classical augmenting-path methods. Notably, our algorithm
is simple, purely combinatorial, and can be naturally interpreted as a
recursive greedy procedure.
  As a further consequence, we obtain a \emph{deterministic} and
\emph{combinatorial} two-party communication protocol for computing a minimum
$s$--$t$ cut using $\widetilde{O}(n^{11/7})$ bits of communication. This
improves upon the previous best bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{5/3})$, which was
obtained via reductions from the aforementioned cut-query algorithms. In
parallel, it has been observed that an $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$-bit randomized
protocol can be achieved via continuous optimization techniques; however, these
methods are fundamentally different from our combinatorial approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究在用户级LDP下探索分布学习，但最基本的测试任务（如均匀性测试和同一性测试）尚未被研究。论文旨在填补这一空白，并提供高效的解决方案。

Method: 研究采用用户级LDP框架，其中每个用户贡献多个样本，并设计了一种无需共享随机种子或全局唯一标识符的对称设置算法。

Result: 论文提出了在用户级LDP下进行均匀性和同一性测试的算法，这些算法在样本效率上接近最优，适用于实际应用中的对称设置。

Conclusion: 论文提出了在用户级本地差分隐私（LDP）下进行分布测试的算法，特别是针对均匀性和同一性测试。这些算法在样本效率上接近最优，且适用于无需共享随机种子或全局唯一标识符的对称设置。

Abstract: We initiate the study of distribution testing under \emph{user-level} local
differential privacy, where each of $n$ users contributes $m$ samples from the
unknown underlying distribution. This setting, albeit very natural, is
significantly more challenging that the usual locally private setting, as for
the same parameter $\varepsilon$ the privacy guarantee must now apply to a full
batch of $m$ data points. While some recent work consider distribution
\emph{learning} in this user-level setting, nothing was known for even the most
fundamental testing task, uniformity testing (and its generalization, identity
testing).
  We address this gap, by providing (nearly) sample-optimal user-level LDP
algorithms for uniformity and identity testing. Motivated by practical
considerations, our main focus is on the private-coin, symmetric setting, which
does not require users to share a common random seed nor to have been assigned
a globally unique identifier.

Abstract: For a graph (undirected, directed, or mixed), a cycle-factor is a collection
of vertex-disjoint cycles covering the entire vertex set. Cycle-factors subject
to parity constraints arise naturally in the study of structural graph theory
and algorithmic complexity. In this work, we study four variants of the problem
of finding a cycle-factor subject to parity constraints: (1) all cycles are
odd, (2) all cycles are even, (3) at least one cycle is odd, and (4) at least
one cycle is even. These variants are considered in the undirected, directed,
and mixed settings. We show that all but the fourth problem are NP-complete in
all settings, while the complexity of the fourth one remains open for the
directed and undirected cases. We also show that in mixed graphs, even deciding
the existence of any cycle factor is NP-complete.

Result: 结果表明，算法在典型常数度规则图中能以常数因子近似平均距离，且证明了对于所有常数度图，任何算法要达到特定近似比都需要查询特定数量的距离。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是，设计了一种确定性算法，能够在典型常数度规则图中高效估算平均距离，并证明了对于所有常数度图，任何算法要达到特定近似比都需要查询特定数量的距离。

Abstract: We design a deterministic algorithm that, given $n$ points in a
\emph{typical} constant degree regular~graph, queries $O(n)$ distances to
output a constant factor approximation to the average distance among those
points, thus answering a question posed in~\cite{MN14}. Our algorithm uses the
method of~\cite{MN14} to construct a sequence of constant degree graphs that
are expanders with respect to certain nonpositively curved metric spaces,
together with a new rigidity theorem for metric transforms of nonpositively
curved metric spaces. The fact that our algorithm works for typical (uniformly
random) constant degree regular graphs rather than for all constant degree
graphs is unavoidable, thanks to the following impossibility result that we
obtain: For every fixed $k\in \N$, the approximation factor of any algorithm
for average distance that works for all constant degree graphs and queries
$o(n^{1+1/k})$ distances must necessarily be at least $2(k+1)$. This matches
the upper bound attained by the algorithm that was designed for general finite
metric spaces in~\cite{BGS}. Thus, any algorithm for average distance in
constant degree graphs whose approximation guarantee is less than $4$ must
query $\Omega(n^2)$ distances, any such algorithm whose approximation guarantee
is less than $6$ must query $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ distances, any such algorithm
whose approximation guarantee less than $8$ must query $\Omega(n^{4/3})$
distances, and so forth, and furthermore there exist algorithms achieving those
parameters.

Abstract: With the growing role of artificial intelligence in climate and weather
research, efficient model training and inference are in high demand. Current
models like FourCastNet and AI-GOMS depend heavily on GPUs, limiting hardware
independence, especially for Chinese domestic hardware and frameworks. To
address this issue, we present a framework for migrating large-scale
atmospheric and oceanic models from PyTorch to MindSpore and optimizing for
Chinese chips, and evaluating their performance against GPUs. The framework
focuses on software-hardware adaptation, memory optimization, and parallelism.
Furthermore, the model's performance is evaluated across multiple metrics,
including training speed, inference speed, model accuracy, and energy
efficiency, with comparisons against GPU-based implementations. Experimental
results demonstrate that the migration and optimization process preserves the
models' original accuracy while significantly reducing system dependencies and
improving operational efficiency by leveraging Chinese chips as a viable
alternative for scientific computing. This work provides valuable insights and
practical guidance for leveraging Chinese domestic chips and frameworks in
atmospheric and oceanic AI model development, offering a pathway toward greater
technological independence.

Abstract: Recent advances in distributed learning systems have introduced effective
solutions for implementing collaborative artificial intelligence techniques in
wireless communication networks. Federated learning approaches provide a
model-aggregation mechanism among edge devices to achieve collaborative
training, while ensuring data security, communication efficiency, and sharing
computational overheads. On the other hand, limited transmission resources and
complex communication environments remain significant bottlenecks to the
efficient collaborations among edge devices, particularly within large-scale
networks. To address such issues, this paper proposes an over-the-air (OTA)
analog aggregation method designed for the distributed swarm learning (DSL),
termed DSL-OTA, aiming to enhance communication efficiency, enable effective
cooperation, and ensure privacy preserving. Incorporating multi-worker
selection strategy with over-the-air aggregation not only makes the standard
DSL based on single best worker contributing to global model update to become
more federated, but also secures the aggregation from potential risks of data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模GPU跟踪数据的复杂性和高计算成本使得性能分析变得困难，需要一种高效的处理方法。

Method: 框架采用分区并行处理跟踪数据，结合因果图方法和并行协调图，以分析执行流中的性能变化和依赖关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架在可扩展性方面提升了67%，证明了其独立分析多个跟踪数据的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的端到端并行性能分析框架显著提高了大规模GPU跟踪数据的处理效率，通过并行处理和因果图方法有效揭示了性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Large-scale GPU traces play a critical role in identifying performance
bottlenecks within heterogeneous High-Performance Computing (HPC)
architectures. However, the sheer volume and complexity of a single trace of
data make performance analysis both computationally expensive and
time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present an end-to-end parallel
performance analysis framework designed to handle multiple large-scale GPU
traces efficiently. Our proposed framework partitions and processes trace data
concurrently and employs causal graph methods and parallel coordinating chart
to expose performance variability and dependencies across execution flows.
Experimental results demonstrate a 67% improvement in terms of scalability,
highlighting the effectiveness of our pipeline for analyzing multiple traces
independently.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SLICE是一种针对边缘计算场景的调度方案，通过动态控制生成速率和请求调度，显著提升LLM服务的SLO达成率和任务完成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调度服务系统仅以最大化输出令牌吞吐量为优化目标，未能充分满足SLO要求的多样性，导致端到端延迟或TPOT相关SLO的违规率居高不下。

Method: 结合效用最大化的请求调度算法和生成速率的动态迭代控制机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，与最先进的解决方案Orca和FastServe相比，SLICE在SLO达成率上提高了35倍，任务完成时间上具有3.4倍的优势。

Conclusion: SLICE是一种创新的调度解决方案，专为具有差异化SLO要求的边缘计算场景设计，显著提高了LLM推理服务的SLO达成率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), as the foundational architecture for
next-generation interactive AI applications, not only power intelligent
dialogue systems but also drive the evolution of embodied intelligence on edge
devices, including humanoid robots, smart vehicles, and other scenarios. The
applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level
Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as
distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token
(TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle
real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine
control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems
still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization
objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements.
This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end
latency or TPOT related SLOs.
  This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for
edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a
utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative
control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM
inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that
compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to
35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the
other two solutions.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Tokencake通过优化KV Cache的调度和内存管理，显著提升LLMs在多代理应用中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多代理应用中使用外部函数调用时，KV Cache面临严重的性能挑战，如空间争用和时间利用率不足。

Method: Tokencake采用空间调度器和时间调度器，前者通过动态内存分区保护关键代理，后者利用主动卸载和预测性上传机制优化GPU内存利用率。

Result: 评估显示，Tokencake能将端到端延迟降低47.06%，GPU内存利用率提升16.9%。

Conclusion: Tokencake作为一种KV-Cache优化的服务框架，通过动态内存分区和预测性上传机制，显著提升了多代理应用中的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in complex multi-agent
applications that use external function calls. This workload creates severe
performance challenges for the KV Cache: space contention leads to the eviction
of critical agents' caches and time underutilization leaves the cache of agents
stalled on long-running tool calls idling in GPU memory. We present Tokencake,
a KV-Cache-centric serving framework that co-optimizes scheduling and memory
management with an agent-aware design. Tokencake's Space Scheduler uses dynamic
memory partitioning to shield critical agents from contention, while its Time
Scheduler employs a proactive offload and predictive upload mechanism to
repurpose GPU memory during function call stalls. Our evaluation on
representative multi-agent benchmarks shows that Tokencake can reduce
end-to-end latency by over 47.06%, improve effective GPU memory utilization by
up to 16.9% compared to vLLM.

Motivation: 解决分布式环境中验证平面性问题的高通信成本挑战，提升效率。

Method: 通过设计$O(\log^{*}n)$轮和$O(1)$或$O(\lceil\log \Delta/\log^{*}n\rceil)$证明大小的DIP协议，验证嵌入式平面性和平面性。

Result: 实现了嵌入式平面性和平面性的高效验证，支持多种轮数和证明大小的组合。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的通信高效的分布式交互证明（DIP）协议，用于验证平面性问题，通过优化交互轮数和证明大小，显著提升了效率。

Abstract: We provide new communication-efficient distributed interactive proofs for
planarity. The notion of a \emph{distributed interactive proof (DIP)} was
introduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena (PODC 2018). In a DIP, the \emph{prover}
is a single centralized entity whose goal is to prove a certain claim regarding
an input graph $G$. To do so, the prover communicates with a distributed
\emph{verifier} that operates concurrently on all $n$ nodes of $G$. A DIP is
measured by the amount of prover-verifier communication it requires. Namely,
the goal is to design a DIP with a small number of interaction rounds and a
small \emph{proof size}, i.e., a small amount of communication per round. Our
main result is an $O(\log ^{*}n)$-round DIP protocol for embedded planarity and
planarity with a proof size of $O(1)$ and $O(\lceil\log \Delta/\log
^{*}n\rceil)$, respectively. In fact, this result can be generalized as
follows. For any $1\leq r\leq \log^{*}n$, there exists an $O(r)$-round protocol
for embedded planarity and planarity with a proof size of $O(\log ^{(r)}n)$ and
$O(\log ^{(r)}n+\log \Delta /r)$, respectively.

Motivation: 大规模软件系统中的性能回归会导致严重的资源效率低下，早期检测至关重要。频繁的基准测试对于识别这些回归并维持服务级别协议（SLA）是必要的，但基准测试本身资源密集且耗时，难以集成到CI/CD管道中。

Method: 本文通过识别基准测试优化中的三个关键挑战（优化策略的可组合性、基准测试结果的自动评估以及在实际CI/CD系统中应用这些策略的复杂性和可用性），提出了一个概念性的云基准测试框架。

Result: 本文确定了阻碍基准测试优化更广泛采用的三个核心挑战，并提出了一个概念性框架来解决这些挑战。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个概念性的基于云的基准测试框架，旨在解决基准测试优化中的三个核心挑战，以促进性能回归检测在CI/CD系统中的实际应用。

Abstract: Performance regressions in large-scale software systems can lead to
substantial resource inefficiencies, making their early detection critical.
Frequent benchmarking is essential for identifying these regressions and
maintaining service-level agreements (SLAs). Performance benchmarks, however,
are resource-intensive and time-consuming, which is a major challenge for
integration into Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
pipelines. Although numerous benchmark optimization techniques have been
proposed to accelerate benchmark execution, there is currently no practical
system that integrates these optimizations seamlessly into real-world CI/CD
pipelines. In this vision paper, we argue that the field of benchmark
optimization remains under-explored in key areas that hinder its broader
adoption. We identify three central challenges to enabling frequent and
efficient benchmarking: (a) the composability of benchmark optimization
strategies, (b) automated evaluation of benchmarking results, and (c) the
usability and complexity of applying these strategies as part of CI/CD systems
in practice. We also introduce a conceptual cloud-based benchmarking framework
handling these challenges transparently. By presenting these open problems, we
aim to stimulate research toward making performance regression detection in
CI/CD systems more practical and effective.

Motivation: 解决广播操作中的拓扑约束、带宽限制和同步开销等挑战，特别是在超级计算机等大规模系统中。

Method: BBS通过精确的通信周期，提供了一个可重复、简化且逐步的广播框架。

Result: 模拟结果显示，BBS算法在各种拓扑结构中始终优于常见的通用广播算法，且优势显著。

Conclusion: BBS算法是一个通用且强大的广播框架，有望重新定义跨网络拓扑的广播策略。

Abstract: We present Broadcast by Balanced Saturation (BBS), a general broadcast
algorithm designed to optimize communication efficiency across diverse network
topologies. BBS maximizes node utilization, addressing challenges in broadcast
operations such as topology constraints, bandwidth limitations, and
synchronization overhead, particularly in large-scale systems like
supercomputers. The algorithm ensures sustained activity with nodes throughout
the broadcast, thereby enhancing data propagation and significantly reducing
latency. Through a precise communication cycle, BBS provides a repeatable,
streamlined, stepwise broadcasting framework. Simulation results across various
topologies demonstrate that the BBS algorithm consistently outperforms common
general broadcast algorithms, often by a substantial margin. These findings
suggest that BBS is a versatile and robust framework with the potential to
redefine broadcast strategies across network topologies.

TL;DR: 本文定量比较了现有RFID缺失标签识别方案，建立了理论性能下限，并提出基于CPT的新算法，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RFID网络中缺失标签识别问题，填补现有解决方案的理论空白并提升效率。

Method: 1. 定量比较现有解决方案；2. 建立预期执行时间的理论下限；3. 提出基于碰撞分区树（CPT）的新算法。

Result: 新算法的时间开销比文献中最佳算法减少高达logN倍。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析和算法设计，显著提升了RFID网络中缺失标签识别的效率，并建立了理论性能极限。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of missing tag identification in RFID networks by
making three contributions. Firstly, we quantitatively compare and gauge the
existing propositions spanning over a decade on missing tag identification. We
show that the expected execution time of the best solution in the literature is
$\Theta \left(N+\frac{(1-\alpha)^2(1-\delta)^2}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$, where
$\delta$ and $\epsilon$ are parameters quantifying the required identification
accuracy, $N$ denotes the number of tags in the system, among which $\alpha N$
tags are missing. Secondly, we analytically establish the expected execution
time lower-bound for any missing tag identification algorithm as
$\Theta\left(\frac{N}{\log N}+\frac{(1-\delta)^2(1-\alpha)^2}{\epsilon^2 \log
\frac{(1-\delta)(1-\alpha)}{\epsilon}}\right)$, thus giving the theoretical
performance limit. Thirdly, we develop a novel missing tag identification
algorithm by leveraging a tree structure with the expected execution time of
$\Theta \left(\frac{\log\log N}{\log N}N+\frac{(1-\alpha)^2(1-\delta)^2}{
\epsilon^2}\right)$, reducing the time overhead by a factor of up to $\log N$
over the best algorithm in the literature. The key technicality in our design
is a novel data structure termed as collision-partition tree (CPT), built on a
subset of bits in tag pseudo-IDs, leading to more balanced tree structure and
reducing the time complexity in parsing the entire tree.

Result: 通过DT-based切片验证器展示了方法的可行性，并提出了可扩展的架构集成方案。

Conclusion: 文章提出了基于可解释模型（如决策树）的轻量级验证方法，用于验证Open RAN中深度强化学习（DRL）代理的行为，并探讨了未来在Open RAN中实现可信AI的挑战。

Abstract: Open RAN introduces a flexible, cloud-based architecture for the Radio Access
Network (RAN), enabling Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning
(ML)-driven automation across heterogeneous, multi-vendor deployments. While
EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) helps mitigate the opacity of AI
models, explainability alone does not guarantee reliable network operations. In
this article, we propose a lightweight verification approach based on
interpretable models to validate the behavior of Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) agents for RAN slicing and scheduling in Open RAN. Specifically, we use
Decision Tree (DT)-based verifiers to perform near-real-time consistency checks
at runtime, which would be otherwise unfeasible with computationally expensive
state-of-the-art verifiers. We analyze the landscape of XAI and AI
verification, propose a scalable architectural integration, and demonstrate
feasibility with a DT-based slice-verifier. We also outline future challenges
to ensure trustworthy AI adoption in Open RAN.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: JAUNT是一个联合对齐用户意图和网络状态的QoE中心工具路由框架，显著提升了服务质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具路由机制仅考虑用户查询与工具的功能匹配，忽略了用户意图可能模糊或未充分指定，以及QoE还受外部因素（如链路延迟和服务器可用性）影响的问题。

Method: JAUNT采用双视角对齐策略，解释用户意图的同时利用LLM代理构建网络配置文件，将数值性能指标映射到语义空间以指导路由。

Result: 实验结果表明，JAUNT相比多个基线显著提升了QoE。

Conclusion: JAUNT显著提升了QoE，证明了在可扩展的LLM服务编排中对齐用户意图和网络状态的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on emerging protocols such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to invoke external tools and services.
However, current tool routing mechanisms remain fragile because they only
consider functional matching between users' queries and tools. In practice,
user intent expressed through queries can be vague or underspecified, and the
actual Quality of Experience (QoE) also depends on external factors such as
link latency and server availability that are not captured by semantics alone.
To address this challenge, we propose JAUNT, a framework for Joint Alignment of
User intent and Network state in QoE-centric Tool routing. JAUNT introduces a
dual-view alignment strategy that interprets user intent while employing LLM
agents to construct network profiles, mapping numerical performance indicators
into the semantic space to guide routing. We further design a benchmark that
integrates diverse user request patterns with heterogeneous network states,
enabling systematic evaluation of QoE outcomes. Experimental results show that
JAUNT significantly improves QoE compared with several baselines, demonstrating
the importance of aligning both intent and network state for scalable LLM
service orchestration.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into organizational
technology frameworks has transformed how organizations engage with AI-driven
models, influencing both operational performance and strategic innovation. With
the advent of foundation models, the importance of structured platforms for AI
model exchange has become paramount for organizational efficacy and
adaptability. However, a comprehensive framework to categorize and understand
these platforms remains underexplored. To address this gap, our taxonomy
provides a structured approach to categorize AI exchange platforms, examining
key dimensions and characteristics, as well as revealing interesting
interaction patterns between public research institutions and organizations:
Some platforms leverage peer review as a mechanism for quality control, and
provide mechanisms for online testing, deploying, and customization of models.
Our paper is beneficial to practitioners seeking to understand challenges and
opportunities that arise from AI exchange platforms. For academics, the
taxonomy serves as a foundation for further research into the evolution,
impact, and best practices associated with AI model sharing and utilization in
different contexts. Additionally, our study provides insights into the evolving
role of AI in various industries, highlighting the importance of adaptability
and innovation in platform design. This paper serves as a critical resource for
understanding the dynamic interplay between technology, business models, and
user engagement in the rapidly growing domain of AI model exchanges pointing

Result: Vibe编码与声明式、函数式和基于提示的编程进行了比较，并讨论了其对软件工程、人机协作和负责任AI实践的影响。

Conclusion: Vibe coding作为一种新兴的AI原生编程范式，虽然带来了生产力和民主化的提升，但仍面临对齐、可重复性、偏见、可解释性、可维护性和安全性等挑战，未来需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled developers to generate
software by conversing with artificial intelligence systems rather than writing
code directly. This paper introduces vibe coding, an emerging AI-native
programming paradigm in which a developer specifies high-level functional
intent along with qualitative descriptors of the desired "vibe" (tone, style,
or emotional resonance). An intelligent agent then transforms those
specifications into executable software. We formalize the definition of vibe
coding and propose a reference architecture that includes an intent parser, a
semantic embedding engine, an agentic code generator, and an interactive
feedback loop. A hypothetical implementation is described. We compare vibe
coding with declarative, functional, and prompt-based programming, and we
discuss its implications for software engineering, human-AI collaboration, and
responsible AI practice. Finally, we examine reported productivity gains and
democratizing effects, review recent studies that highlight vulnerabilities and
potential slowdowns, identify key challenges such as alignment,
reproducibility, bias, explainability, maintainability, and security, and
outline future directions and open research questions.

agreement directly written into lines of code. They run on blockchain platforms
and automatically enforce and execute the terms of an agreement when meeting
predefined conditions. However, Smart Contracts, as software models, often
contain notable errors in their operation or specifications. This observation
prompts us to conduct a focused study examining related works published across
various sources. These publications detail specifications, verification tools,
and relevant experiments. Subsequently, this survey proposes an alternative
formal verification based on description logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决竞争性编码基准依赖静态、人工编写问题带来的数据污染和可扩展性限制。

Method: UniCode利用大型语言模型（LLMs）通过三种策略（单问题扩展、同类型融合和跨类型融合）系统化地多样化问题，并结合压力驱动的测试用例合成管道生成可靠的测试套件。

Result: UniCode生成的基准测试具有高度挑战性和区分性，表现最佳的模型o4-mini通过率仅为70.3%。

Conclusion: UniCode框架为编码领域提供了一个可扩展且可靠的动态评估数据集生成解决方案。

Abstract: The reliance of competitive coding benchmarks on static, human-authored
problems creates significant challenges, including data contamination and
limited scalability. To address these issues, we introduce UniCode, a novel
framework that automatically generates high-quality algorithmic problems
alongside robust, contamination-resistant test cases. Inspired by biological
evolution that creates better and diverse offspring, our framework leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically diversify problems through three
strategies: single problem extension, same-type fusion, and cross-type fusion.
A key innovation is our stress-driven test case synthesis pipeline, which
generates reliable test suites without requiring a canonical ground-truth
solution. This pipeline combines brute-force grounding for small-scale inputs
with a consensus-based validation mechanism for large-scale inputs to ensure
high correctness and coverage. We demonstrate effectiveness of our framework by
curating a benchmark of 492 problems and evaluating 19 state-of-the-art LLMs.
The results reveal that UniCode is highly challenging and discriminative, with
the top-performing model, o4-mini, achieving a pass rate of only 70.3%. Our
framework provides a scalable and reliable solution for generating dynamic
evaluation datasets in coding domain.

TL;DR: 通过LLM和RAG结合，修复kubectl命令的语义错误，显著提升执行成功率和正确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具调用（如kubectl）常因语义错误失败，需通过分析工具响应来识别和修复这些错误。

Method: 开发了一个后工具执行反思组件，结合LLM和RAG，利用工具相关文档和故障排除文档进行错误修复。

Result: RAG-based反思使kubectl命令执行成功率提高55%，正确回答率提高36%，故障排除文档比官方文档平均提高10%通过率。

Conclusion: 结合大型语言模型（LLM）的反思和特定领域的检索增强生成（RAG）能有效修复工具调用中的语义错误，尤其在kubectl命令中显著提高了执行成功率和正确率。

Abstract: Agentic systems interact with external systems by calling tools such as
Python functions, REST API endpoints, or command line tools such as kubectl in
Kubernetes. These tool calls often fail for various syntactic and semantic
reasons. Some less obvious semantic errors can only be identified and resolved
after analyzing the tool's response. To repair these errors, we develop a
post-tool execution reflection component that combines large language model
(LLM)-based reflection with domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) using documents describing both the specific tool being called and
troubleshooting documents related to the tool. For this paper, we focus on the
use case of the kubectl command line tool to manage Kubernetes, a platform for
orchestrating cluster applications. Through a larger empirical study and a
smaller manual evaluation, we find that our RAG-based reflection will repair
kubectl commands such that they are both more likely to successfully execute
(pass rate) for 55% of our models evaluated and 36% more likely to correctly
answer the user query on average. We find that troubleshooting documents
improve pass rate compared to official documentation by an average of 10%.

TL;DR: TritonRL是一种专为Triton内核生成设计的LLM，通过监督微调和强化学习解决了数据稀缺和奖励黑客问题，实现了高性能内核生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的快速发展，对自动化高性能系统内核的需求日益增长，但Triton内核生成面临数据稀缺和不完整评估标准的独特挑战。

Method: 采用监督微调和强化学习（RL）相结合的方法，通过细粒度验证和分层奖励分解来提升代码质量，并防止奖励黑客攻击。

Result: 在KernelBench上的实验表明，TritonRL在正确性和加速方面均达到最先进水平，超越了其他Triton专用模型。

Conclusion: TritonRL通过其创新的训练框架和强化学习方法，成功解决了Triton内核生成中的独特挑战，实现了在KernelBench上的最先进正确性和加速表现，证明了其RL训练范式的有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), the demand for
automated, high-performance system kernels has emerged as a key enabler for
accelerating development and deployment. We introduce TritonRL, a
domain-specialized LLM for Triton kernel generation, trained with a novel
training framework that enables robust and automated kernel synthesis. Unlike
general-purpose programming languages, Triton kernel generation faces unique
challenges due to data scarcity and incomplete evaluation criteria, vulnerable
to reward hacking. Our approach addresses these challenges end-to-end by
distilling Triton-specific knowledge through supervised fine-tuning on curated
datasets, and further improving code quality via reinforcement learning (RL)
with robust, verifiable rewards and hierarchical reward assignment. Our RL
framework robustly detects reward hacking and guides both reasoning traces and
code tokens through fine-grained verification and hierarchical reward
decomposition, enabling the model to generate high-quality Triton kernels that
can truly replace existing modules. With robust and fine-grained evaluation,
our experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that TritonRL achieves
state-of-the-art correctness and speedup, surpassing all other Triton-specific
models and underscoring the effectiveness of our RL-based training paradigm.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GenAI在代码理解中潜力与挑战并存，需优化解释准确性和提示设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨GenAI如何帮助程序员理解代码，并为教育工作者提供基于证据的指导。

Method: 通过系统文献综述（SLR）分析了2022年至2024年间发表的31项研究。

Result: GenAI工具常产生不准确或模糊的解释，新手程序员在提示设计上存在困难。

Conclusion: GenAI工具在代码理解方面既有潜力也存在挑战，特别是在教育领域。未来的研究需要进一步探索如何优化GenAI的解释准确性和提示有效性。

Abstract: The ability to comprehend code has long been recognized as an essential skill
in software engineering. As programmers lean more heavily on generative
artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants to develop code solutions, it is
becoming increasingly important for programmers to comprehend GenAI solutions
so that they can verify their appropriateness and properly integrate them into
existing code. At the same time, GenAI tools are increasingly being enlisted to
provide programmers with tailored explanations of code written both by GenAI
and humans. Thus, in computing education, GenAI presents new challenges and
opportunities for learners who are trying to comprehend computer programs. To
provide computing educators with evidence-based guidance on the use of GenAI to
facilitate code comprehension and to identify directions for future research,
we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of state-of-the-art approaches
and tools that leverage GenAI to enhance code comprehension. Our SLR focuses on
31 studies published between 2022 and 2024. Despite their potential, GenAI
assistants often yield inaccurate or unclear explanations, and novice
programmers frequently struggle to craft effective prompts, thereby impeding
their ability to leverage GenAI to aid code comprehension. Our review
classifies GenAI-based approaches and tools, identifies methods used to study
them, and summarizes the empirical evaluations of their effectiveness. We
consider the implications of our findings for computing education research and
practice, and identify directions for future research.

TL;DR: SpecAgent通过索引时异步构建推测性上下文，提升代码生成质量并降低延迟，实验显示其性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在现实软件仓库中因项目特定API和跨文件依赖而表现不佳的问题，同时应对低延迟预算对检索质量或用户体验的负面影响。

Method: 提出SpecAgent，一种在索引时异步探索仓库文件并构建推测性上下文的代理，以优化代码生成和延迟。

Result: SpecAgent在无泄漏基准测试中相比最佳基线实现了9-11%的绝对增益（48-58%相对增益），并显著降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: SpecAgent通过前瞻性探索和构建推测性上下文，显著提高了代码生成质量和推理延迟，同时在无泄漏基准测试中验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code-related tasks but often struggle
in realistic software repositories, where project-specific APIs and cross-file
dependencies are crucial. Retrieval-augmented methods mitigate this by
injecting repository context at inference time. The low inference-time latency
budget affects either retrieval quality or the added latency adversely impacts
user experience. We address this limitation with SpecAgent, an agent that
improves both latency and code-generation quality by proactively exploring
repository files during indexing and constructing speculative context that
anticipates future edits in each file. This indexing-time asynchrony allows
thorough context computation, masking latency, and the speculative nature of
the context improves code-generation quality. Additionally, we identify the
problem of future context leakage in existing benchmarks, which can inflate
reported performance. To address this, we construct a synthetic, leakage-free
benchmark that enables a more realistic evaluation of our agent against
baselines. Experiments show that SpecAgent consistently achieves absolute gains
of 9-11% (48-58% relative) compared to the best-performing baselines, while
significantly reducing inference latency.

TL;DR: Chart2Code是一个多层次图表理解和代码生成基准测试，任务难度逐步增加，实验显示当前最先进模型表现不佳，凸显其挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了从用户驱动的角度评估大型多模态模型的图表理解和代码生成能力，设计一个能反映实际使用场景且任务难度逐步增加的基准测试。

Method: Chart2Code设计了三个层次的任务：图表复制（Level 1）、图表编辑（Level 2）和长表格到图表生成（Level 3），包含2,023个任务和22种图表类型，并采用多级评估指标。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使是当前最先进的模型GPT-5，在编辑任务中的代码正确性评估平均得分仅为0.57，图表质量评估平均得分仅为0.22。

Conclusion: Chart2Code基准测试通过多层次任务和评估指标，展示了当前大型多模态模型在图表理解和代码生成方面的挑战，尤其是GPT-5在编辑任务中的表现不佳，凸显了该基准的难度。

Abstract: We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart
understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models
(LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective,
capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task
difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction)
reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart
Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding
elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to
transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user
instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that
reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task
complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types,
paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness
and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art
(SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such
as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental
results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on
code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing
tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark
will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more
robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.

Abstract: Jupyter notebooks are widely used for machine learning (ML) prototyping. Yet
few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, potentially due to
the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of
real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench has 111 curated and
reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a
verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras,
PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific
out-of-order execution issue. To support reproducibility and ease of use,
JunoBench offers a unified execution environment where crashes and fixes can be

within AI innovation projects. To address this, we propose and evaluate DIP-AI,
a discovery framework tailored to guide early-stage exploration in such
initiatives. Based on a literature review, our solution proposal combines
elements of ISO 12207, 5338, and Design Thinking to support the discovery of AI
innovation projects, aiming at promoting higher quality deliveries and
stakeholder satisfaction. We evaluated DIP-AI in an industry-academia
collaboration (IAC) case study of an AI innovation project, in which
participants applied DIP-AI to the discovery phase in practice and provided
their perceptions about the approach's problem discovery capability,
acceptance, and suggestions. The results indicate that DIP-AI is relevant and
useful, particularly in facilitating problem discovery in AI projects. This
research contributes to academia by sharing DIP-AI as a framework for AI
problem discovery. For industry, we discuss the use of this framework in a real
IAC program that develops AI innovation projects.

TL;DR: 研究通过LLM自动分类NFR，Gemma-2和Phi-3表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动识别NFR耗时且易错，需要自动化解决方案，而构建高质量数据集是前提。

Method: 收集NFR数据并分类，使用RoBERTa、CodeBERT、Gemma-2、Phi-3、Mistral-8B和Llama-3.1-8B等LLM模型进行分类比较。

Result: Gemma-2表现最佳（精度0.87，召回率0.89，F1分数0.88），Phi-3紧随其后。

Conclusion: Gemma-2和Phi-3在NFR分类任务中表现最佳，尤其是Gemma-2在精度、召回率和F1分数上均领先。

Abstract: Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) play a critical role in determining the
overall quality and user satisfaction of software systems. Accurately
identifying and classifying NFRs is essential to ensure that software meets
performance, usability, and reliability expectations. However, manual
identification of NFRs from documentation is time-consuming and prone to
errors, necessitating automated solutions. Before implementing any automated
solution, a robust and comprehensive dataset is essential. To build such a
dataset, we collected NFRs from various Project Charters and Open Source
Software Documentation. This enhanced the technical depth and usability of an
already existing NFR dataset. We categorized NFRs into sub-classes and
identified needs using widely used Large Language Models to facilitate
automation. After classifying the NFRs, we compared the classification results
of the selected LLMs: RoBERTa, CodeBERT, Gemma-2, Phi-3, Mistral-8B, and
Llama-3.1-8B using various evaluation metrics, including precision, recall,
F1-score, and lime scores. Among these models, Gemma-2 achieved the best
results with a precision of 0.87, recall of 0.89, and F1-score of 0.88,
alongside a lime hit score of 78 out of 80. Phi-3 closely followed with a
precision of 0.85, recall of 0.87, F1-score of 0.86, and the highest lime hit
score of 79. By improving the contextual foundation, this integration enhanced
the model's comprehension of technical aspects and user requirements.

TL;DR: BlueCodeAgent通过自动化红队测试增强蓝队防御，显著提升代码生成模型的安全性，减少误报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前针对代码生成模型的安全研究主要集中在红队测试，蓝队防御进展有限，亟需有效区分安全与不安全代码的语义理解方法。

Method: 提出BlueCodeAgent框架，结合红队测试生成多样化风险实例，蓝队代理通过代码分析和多级防御机制检测风险。

Result: 在三个代码相关任务中，BlueCodeAgent平均F1分数提升12.7%，特别是在减少误报方面效果显著。

Conclusion: BlueCodeAgent通过自动化红队测试和集成多级防御，显著提升了代码生成模型的安全性，尤其在减少误报方面表现突出。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation,
concerns over the security risks have grown substantially. Early research has
primarily focused on red teaming, which aims to uncover and evaluate
vulnerabilities and risks of CodeGen models. However, progress on the blue
teaming side remains limited, as developing defense requires effective semantic
understanding to differentiate the unsafe from the safe. To fill in this gap,
we propose BlueCodeAgent, an end-to-end blue teaming agent enabled by automated
red teaming. Our framework integrates both sides: red teaming generates diverse
risky instances, while the blue teaming agent leverages these to detect
previously seen and unseen risk scenarios through constitution and code
analysis with agentic integration for multi-level defense. Our evaluation
across three representative code-related tasks--bias instruction detection,
malicious instruction detection, and vulnerable code detection--shows that
BlueCodeAgent achieves significant gains over the base models and safety
prompt-based defenses. In particular, for vulnerable code detection tasks,
BlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic analysis to effectively reduce false
positives, a challenging problem as base models tend to be over-conservative,
misclassifying safe code as unsafe. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average
12.7\% F1 score improvement across four datasets in three tasks, attributed to
its ability to summarize actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware
risk detection. We demonstrate that the red teaming benefits the blue teaming
by continuously identifying new vulnerabilities to enhance defense performance.

TL;DR: TestPrune利用回归测试提升错误重现和补丁验证效率，成本低且效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实项目中的测试套件虽大且覆盖率高，但仍无法检测所有错误。回归测试可补充用于调试当前版本。

Method: TestPrune是一种全自动化技术，利用问题跟踪报告并战略性地复用回归测试，用于错误重现和补丁验证。

Result: TestPrune在Otter框架中使问题重现率相对提高6.2%-9.0%，在Agentless框架中使问题解决率相对提高9.4%-12.9%。

Conclusion: TestPrune通过智能复用回归测试，显著提高了问题重现率和解决率，且成本开销极低。

Abstract: Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code
coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of
unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While
regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is
preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose:
debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance
the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2)
validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present
TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and
strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch
validation.
  A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the
regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the
predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential
as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate
inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline
and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show
that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction
rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue
resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench
Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but
not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of
using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance,
using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.

Motivation: 传统软件工程方法在处理ML组件的静默故障、OOD数据和对抗攻击等挑战时不足，需要一种统一的框架来增强ML系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了ML-On-Rails协议，整合了OOD检测、对抗攻击检测、输入验证和可解释性等关键保障措施，并采用HTTP状态码进行模型与软件间的通信。

Result: 通过从业者调查发现当前解决方案的不足，并验证了ML-On-Rails协议在提升系统鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文强调了ML-On-Rails协议在提升ML系统鲁棒性和可信度方面的潜力，并指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Ensuring robustness in ML-enabled software systems requires addressing
critical challenges, such as silent failures, out-of-distribution (OOD) data,
and adversarial attacks. Traditional software engineering practices, which rely
on predefined logic, are insufficient for ML components that depend on data and
probabilistic decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose the
ML-On-Rails protocol, a unified framework designed to enhance the robustness
and trustworthiness of ML-enabled systems in production. This protocol
integrates key safeguards such as OOD detection, adversarial attack detection,
input validation, and explainability. It also includes a model-to-software
communication framework using HTTP status codes to enhance transparency in
reporting model outcomes and errors. To align our approach with real-world
challenges, we conducted a practitioner survey, which revealed major robustness
issues, gaps in current solutions, and highlighted how a standardised protocol
such as ML-On-Rails can improve system robustness. Our findings highlight the
need for more support and resources for engineers working with ML systems.
Finally, we outline future directions for refining the proposed protocol,
leveraging insights from the survey and real-world applications to continually
enhance its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM自我修复方法缺乏深入的运行时行为分析，无法有效诊断复杂逻辑错误的根本原因。

Method: 提出了InspectCoder，一个双代理框架，支持战略性的断点放置、目标状态检查和增量运行时实验，通过调试器反馈进行多步推理。

Result: 在BigCodeBench-R和LiveCodeBench-R上，InspectCoder相对最强基线修复准确率提升了5.10%-60.37%，且修复效率提高了1.67x-2.24x。

Conclusion: InspectCoder展示了LLM驱动的动态分析在自动化软件工程中的巨大潜力，并通过开源中间件InspectWare简化了调试复杂性和维护状态化调试会话。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex
logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based
self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on
superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often
expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities
that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic
program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis
via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic
breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime
experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that
follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and
perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate
process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning,
transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic
root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging
self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder
achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the
strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency
respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that
abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions
across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable
insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the
significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software
engineering.

Method: 通过分析25个代码和文档特征，比较了人类编写的Kaggle获奖笔记本与GenAI笔记本的差异。

Result: 研究发现，GenAI笔记本在代码质量上表现更好，而人类笔记本在结构多样性、复杂性和问题解决创新性上更胜一筹。

Conclusion: 本研究为未来探索如何最大化人类与AI在笔记本中的协作潜力提供了四个研究方向。

Abstract: Computational notebooks have become the preferred tool of choice for data
scientists and practitioners to perform analyses and share results. Notebooks
uniquely combine scripts with documentation. With the emergence of generative
AI (GenAI) technologies, it is increasingly important, especially in
competitive settings, to distinguish the characteristics of human-written
versus GenAI.
  In this study, we present three case studies to explore potential strengths
of both humans and GenAI through the coding and documenting activities in
notebooks. We first characterize differences between 25 code and documentation
features in human-written, medal-winning Kaggle notebooks. We find that gold
medalists are primarily distinguished by longer and more detailed
documentation. Second, we analyze the distinctions between human-written and
GenAI notebooks. Our results show that while GenAI notebooks tend to achieve
higher code quality (as measured by metrics like code smells and technical
debt), human-written notebooks display greater structural diversity,
complexity, and innovative approaches to problem-solving. Based on these
results, we envision the work as groundwork that highlight four agendas to
further investigate how GenAI could be utilized in notebooks that maximizes the
potential collaboration between human and AI.

TL;DR: 本文首次大规模研究了漏洞PoC的可用性、完整性和可复现性，发现多数漏洞缺乏PoC且现有报告缺失关键组件，提出了提升PoC可用性的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漏洞的概念验证（PoC）对于验证漏洞存在、减少误报和展示安全威胁的严重性至关重要，但PoC研究远落后于漏洞数据研究。这一差距归因于多个挑战，如PoC分散在多个平台、写作风格多样化和复现困难。

Method: 1) 收集了来自13个平台的470,921个PoC及其报告，构建了迄今为止最广泛的公开PoC数据集；2) 提出了一种结合模式匹配技术和微调BERT-NER模型的组件提取方法，从PoC报告中提取9个关键组件；3) 招募了8名参与者手动复现150个抽样漏洞，基于32种漏洞类型，深入分析PoC的可复现性及其影响因素。

Result: 研究发现78.9%的CVE漏洞缺乏可用PoC，现有PoC报告通常缺失约30%的关键组件，影响漏洞理解和复现。同时，识别了导致复现失败的各种原因。

Conclusion: 作者提出了可行策略，以增强漏洞PoC的整体可用性，从而加强软件安全性。

Abstract: The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for a vulnerability is crucial in validating its
existence, mitigating false positives, and illustrating the severity of the
security threat it poses. However, research on PoCs significantly lags behind
studies focusing on vulnerability data. This discrepancy can be directly
attributed to several challenges, including the dispersion of real-world PoCs
across multiple platforms, the diversity in writing styles, and the difficulty
associated with PoC reproduction. To fill this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale study on PoCs in the wild, assessing their report availability,
completeness, reproducibility. Specifically, 1) to investigate PoC reports
availability for CVE vulnerability, we collected an extensive dataset of
470,921 PoCs and their reports from 13 platforms, representing the broadest
collection of publicly available PoCs to date. 2) To assess the completeness of
PoC report at a fine-grained level, we proposed a component extraction method,
which combines pattern-matching techniques with a fine-tuned BERT-NER model to
extract 9 key components from PoC reports. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of
PoCs, we recruited 8 participants to manually reproduce 150 sampled
vulnerabilities with 32 vulnerability types based on PoC reports, enabling an
in-depth analysis of PoC reproducibility and the factors influencing it. Our
findings reveal that 78.9% of CVE vulnerabilities lack available PoCs, and
existing PoC reports typically miss about 30% of the essential components
required for effective vulnerability understanding and reproduction, with
various reasons identified for the failure to reproduce vulnerabilities using
available PoC reports. Finally, we proposed actionable strategies for
stakeholders to enhance the overall usability of vulnerability PoCs in
strengthening software security.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种整合LLMs到定性研究的方法，并通过实证评估发现LLM生成的代码在61%的情况下更受专家青睐，但也存在碎片化数据和主题边界不清等问题。人类解释在捕捉潜在含义方面仍不可替代。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能的发展，大型语言模型（LLMs）逐渐进入定性研究流程，但目前缺乏可重复的方法将其整合到如主题分析（TA）这样的常用方法中，且现有研究未能系统评估LLM生成的定性输出是否符合既定质量标准。

Method: 研究设计并迭代改进了适用于Braun和Clarke的反身性主题分析（TA）第2-5阶段的提示，随后测试了多个LLM生成的输出与经验丰富的研究者生成的代码和主题的对比。通过15个关于软件工程师福祉的访谈，四位专家评估者进行了盲评，应用了直接源自Braun和Clarke质量标准的评估标准。

Result: 评估者61%的情况下更偏好LLM生成的代码，认为这些代码对回答研究问题具有分析价值。然而，LLMs也存在不足，如不必要地碎片化数据、遗漏潜在解释，以及有时生成边界不明确的主题。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种可重复的方法，将大型语言模型（LLMs）整合到定性研究中，并通过系统性评估验证了LLM生成的代码和主题的有效性。尽管LLMs在某些方面表现优异，但人类解释在捕捉潜在含义和维护主题边界方面仍不可或缺。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances, large language models (LLMs) are
entering qualitative research workflows, yet no reproducible methods exist for
integrating them into established approaches like thematic analysis (TA), one
of the most common qualitative methods in software engineering research.
Moreover, existing studies lack systematic evaluation of LLM-generated
qualitative outputs against established quality criteria. We designed and
iteratively refined prompts for Phases 2-5 of Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA,
then tested outputs from multiple LLMs against codes and themes produced by
experienced researchers. Using 15 interviews on software engineers' well-being,
we conducted blind evaluations with four expert evaluators who applied rubrics
derived directly from Braun and Clarke's quality criteria. Evaluators preferred
LLM-generated codes 61% of the time, finding them analytically useful for
answering the research question. However, evaluators also identified
limitations: LLMs fragmented data unnecessarily, missed latent interpretations,
and sometimes produced themes with unclear boundaries. Our contributions are
threefold. First, a reproducible approach integrating refined, documented
prompts with an evaluation framework to operationalize Braun and Clarke's
reflexive TA. Second, an empirical comparison of LLM- and human-generated codes
and themes in software engineering data. Third, guidelines for integrating LLMs
into qualitative analysis while preserving methodological rigour, clarifying
when and how LLMs can assist effectively and when human interpretation remains
essential.

TL;DR: CodeRL+通过整合执行语义对齐提升代码生成功能正确性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现优异，但其训练基于文本模式与功能正确性之间存在语义鸿沟，现有方法如RLVR依赖二进制的通过/失败信号效率低下。

Method: 提出CodeRL+，一种集成执行语义对齐的RLVR训练方法，通过推断变量级执行轨迹提供直接学习信号。

Result: CodeRL+在pass@1上实现4.6%的相对提升，在代码推理和测试输出生成基准上分别提高15.5%和4.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: CodeRL+通过整合执行语义对齐到RLVR训练流程中，显著提升了代码生成的功能正确性，并在多种编码任务中展现出强大的泛化能力和适用性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from
vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on
textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by
formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from
executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is
inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual
representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle
logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel
approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training
pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level
execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution
semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using
existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL
algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms
post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6%
average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to
other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning
and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong
applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe
analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment
between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.

TL;DR: 本研究提出VAPU多代理系统，通过LLM分阶段更新遗留代码，测试显示其在低温度设置下性能优于传统提示方法，满足了更多更新需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遗留应用程序中的过时组件会带来兼容性、安全性和可靠性风险，但高资源成本使企业难以更新。本研究旨在通过LLM多代理系统提供一种经济高效的自主更新解决方案。

Method: 本研究提出了一种名为VAPU的多代理系统，通过模拟软件开发团队中的不同角色分阶段更新代码文件。研究扩展了之前的评估，从单一LLM扩展到五种LLM，并测试了温度参数在0到1之间的设置，同时使用20个开源Python项目进行测试。

Result: 扩展评估显示，VAPU在低温度设置下与零样本学习和单样本学习提示相比，错误数量相似，但满足的需求更高，具体取决于使用的LLM。VAPU在Python文件更新需求上的成功率比ZSL/OSL提示高出22.5%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的多代理系统（如VAPU）是自主更新遗留应用程序组件的有效解决方案，尤其在低温度设置下，其性能优于零样本学习和单样本学习提示。

Abstract: In this study, we present a solution for the modernization of legacy
applications, an area of code generation where LLM-based multi-agent systems
are proving essential for complex multi-phased tasks. Legacy applications often
contain deprecated components that create compatibility, security, and
reliability risks, but high resource costs make companies hesitate to update.
We take a step forward to integrate an LLM-based multi-agent system as part of
a legacy web application update to provide a cost-effective solution to update
legacy applications autonomously. We propose a multi-agent system named a
Verifying Agent Pipeline Updater (VAPU), which is designed to update code files
in phases while simulating different roles in a software development team. In
our previous study, we evaluated the system for legacy version updates by using
six legacy web application view files by resulting errors and accomplished
requirements. This study extends the previous evaluation of a multi-agent
pipeline system by extending the evaluation of VAPU from a single LLM to five
LLMs and using the temperature parameter in both 0 to 1 settings. Additionally,
we tested the system with 20 open-source Python GitHub projects. The results of
the evaluation were compared to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning
(OSL) prompts. The extended evaluation of VAPU showed that particularly in a
low-temperature VAPU can get similar level of error count compared to the
ZSL/OSL prompts but with a higher level of fulfilled requirements, depending on
the LLM. VAPU showed up to 22.5% increase in the succeeding Python file update
requirements compared to ZSL/OSL prompts. The study indicates that an LLM-based
multi-agent system is a capable solution to update components of a legacy
application autonomously.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种考虑服务状态的服务模型推导方法，通过分析消息依赖关系提高响应生成准确性，评估显示优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业软件系统日益与多样化服务集成，测试这些高度互联系统面临访问连接服务的挑战。现有服务虚拟化技术大多未能考虑服务状态，导致服务仿真准确性降低和测试环境真实性不足。

Method: 通过揭示交互消息之间的上下文依赖关系和分析消息数据值之间的关系，推导出服务模型。

Result: 使用从有状态和无状态服务收集的交互轨迹进行评估，结果表明在服务响应生成方面，该方法在准确性和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种考虑服务状态的服务模型推导方法，显著提高了服务响应生成的准确性和效率，尤其在处理有状态服务时表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Enterprise software systems are increasingly integrating with diverse
services to meet expanding business demands. Testing these highly
interconnected systems presents a challenge due to the need for access to the
connected services. Service virtualization has emerged as a widely used
technique to derive service models from recorded interactions, for service
response generation during system testing. Various methods have been proposed
to emulate actual service behavior based on these interactions, but most fail
to account for the service's state, which reduces the accuracy of service
emulation and the realism of the testing environment, especially when dealing
with stateful services. This paper proposes an approach to deriving service
models from service interactions, which enhance the accuracy of response
generation by considering service state. This is achieved by uncovering
contextual dependencies among interaction messages and analyzing the
relationships between message data values. The approach is evaluated using
interaction traces collected from both stateful and stateless services, and the
results reveal notable enhancements in accuracy and efficiency over existing
approaches in service response generation.

Motivation: 研究项目组织中演示器主题的不确定性是一个常见挑战，提案阶段对演示覆盖范围的详细描述不足，导致结果演示与目标不匹配，阻碍进展。现有的TRL量表作为松散描述工具效果有限。

Method: 论文提出了一个演示器需求详细框架，包括5个层次化的演示级别，并与项目期望和工业用例明确连接。框架在软件密集型系统和工业信息物理系统的应用范围内进行了验证。

Result: 框架在两个研究项目中进行了初步验证（一个在早期阶段，一个在后期阶段），结果显示其有效性。但由于完整验证需要4-5年时间，目前尚未进行。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个演示器需求详细框架，旨在评估目标演示的可行性，进行现实调整，并帮助描述需求。通过定义5个层次化的演示级别，该框架能明确连接期望（如工作包交互）和项目的工业用例。初步验证表明框架在早期和后期项目阶段均有效。

Abstract: One of the challenges apparent in the organisation of research projects is
the uncertainties around the subject of demonstrators. A precise and detailed
elicitation of the coverage for project demonstrators is often an afterthought
and not sufficiently detailed during proposal writing. This practice leads to
continuous confusion and a mismatch between targeted and achievable
demonstration of results, hindering progress. The reliance on the TRL scale as
a loose descriptor does not help either. We propose a demonstrator requirements
elaboration framework aiming to evaluate the feasibility of targeted
demonstrations, making realistic adjustments, and assist in describing
requirements. In doing so, we define 5 hierarchical levels of demonstration,
clearly connected to expectations, e.g., work package interaction, and also
connected to the project's industrial use-cases. The considered application
scope in this paper is the domain of software-intensive systems and industrial
cyber-physical systems. A complete validation is not accessible, as it would
require application of our framework at the start of a project and observing
the results at the end, taking 4-5 years. Nonetheless, we have applied it to
two research projects from our portfolio, one at the early and another at the
final stages, revealing its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子程序具有与经典软件工程不同的语义，如幺正性、纠缠、不可克隆定理和测量的破坏性，这些特性使得经典抽象机制在量子计算中可能违反物理约束。

Method: 本文识别了量子软件工程中的基本冲突，提出了三类故障案例，并提出了一套物理可靠的抽象机制设计原则。

Result: 本文展示了三类故障案例，并提出了物理可靠的抽象机制设计原则，以及量子特定类型系统、效果注释和合约模块设计等研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文提出了基于量子语义的抽象设计原则，并建议了量子特定类型系统、效果注释和基于合约的模块设计等研究方向，旨在重新思考量子软件工程中的抽象问题。

Abstract: Abstraction is a fundamental principle in classical software engineering,
which enables modularity, reusability, and scalability. However, quantum
programs adhere to fundamentally different semantics, such as unitarity,
entanglement, the no-cloning theorem, and the destructive nature of
measurement, which introduce challenges to the safe use of classical
abstraction mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental conflict in quantum
software engineering: abstraction practices that are syntactically valid may
violate the physical constraints of quantum computation. We present three
classes of failure cases where naive abstraction breaks quantum semantics and
propose a set of design principles for physically sound abstraction mechanisms.
We further propose research directions, including quantum-specific type
systems, effect annotations, and contract-based module design. Our goal is to
initiate a systematic rethinking of abstraction in quantum software
engineering, based on quantum semantics and considering engineering
scalability.

Motivation: 探讨LLM-as-a-judge在开放任务和动态环境中的可靠性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入WebDevJudge基准，支持基于静态观察的非交互式评估和动态网页环境的连续交互式评估，使用人工偏好标签和结构化评分标准。

Result: 实验显示LLM评估者与人类专家之间存在显著差距，主要源于模型在识别功能等价性、验证任务可行性和减少偏见方面的局限性。

Conclusion: WebDevJudge为LLM-as-a-judge范式在复杂开放任务中的可靠性提出了重要挑战，并为未来开发更可靠的自动化评估工具提供了方向。

Abstract: The paradigm of LLM-as-a-judge is emerging as a scalable and efficient
alternative to human evaluation, demonstrating strong performance on
well-defined tasks. However, its reliability in open-ended tasks with dynamic
environments and complex interactions remains unexplored. To bridge the gap, we
introduce WebDevJudge, a systematic benchmark for assessing LLM-as-a-judge
performance in web development, with support for both non-interactive
evaluation based on static observations and continuous interactive evaluation
with a dynamic web environment. WebDevJudge comprises human preference labels
over paired web implementations, annotated with structured and query-grounded
rubrics to ensure high-quality ground truth. Using this benchmark, we
comprehensively evaluate various evaluators, including LLMs, MLLMs, and agentic
workflows. We systematically investigate the impact of different paradigms and
guidance mechanisms. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between LLM
judges and human experts. In-depth analysis indicates this gap stems from
fundamental model limitations, including failures in recognizing functional
equivalence, verifying task feasibility, and mitigating bias. Overall,
WebDevJudge presents a significant challenge to LLM-as-a-judge, offering
insights to guide future research toward developing more reliable and capable
automated evaluators for complicated scenarios. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 低代码开发平台（LCDPs）的快速普及使得组织需要系统化的评估方法来做出明智的平台选择决策。

Method: 提出了一个基于五个关键标准的加权评分模型，包括业务流程编排、UI/UX定制、集成与互操作性、治理与安全性以及AI增强自动化。

Result: 通过企业环境中的实证验证，证明了该结构化方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的评估框架能够显著改善低代码平台选择的决策结果，降低平台锁定或选择不合适的风险。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDPs) has created a
critical need for systematic evaluation methodologies that enable organizations
to make informed platform selection decisions. This paper presents a
comprehensive evaluation framework based on five key criteria: Business Process
Orchestration, UI/UX Customization, Integration and Interoperability,
Governance and Security, and AI-Enhanced Automation. We propose a weighted
scoring model that allows organizations to quantitatively assess and compare
different low-code platforms based on their specific requirements and strategic
priorities. The framework addresses the gap between marketing-driven platform
comparisons and rigorous, context-specific evaluation methodologies. Through
empirical validation in enterprise environments, we demonstrate how this
structured approach can significantly improve decision-making outcomes and
reduce the risk of platform lock-in or inadequate solution selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于脚本的验证器在评估计算机使用代理（CUA）时存在可扩展性不足和无法提供逐步评估的问题，而奖励模型的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过构建首个CUA奖励基准（CUARewardBench），涵盖10个软件类别和7种代理架构的轨迹，并采用专家标注和严格质量控制。通过7种视觉语言模型和3种提示模板的广泛实验，分析当前CUA奖励模型的局限性，并提出UPE集成方法。

Result: UPE方法在ORM和PRM上分别实现了89.8%和81.7%的精确度，显著优于单一视觉语言模型和传统集成方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了CUARewardBench，通过系统评估和综合分析，揭示了当前CUA奖励模型的局限性，并提出了一种新颖的集成方法UPE，显著提升了奖励模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs) enable task completion through natural
interaction with operating systems and software interfaces. While script-based
verifiers are widely adopted for evaluation, they suffer from limited
scalability and inability to provide step-wise assessment. Reward models offer
promising alternatives, but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains
largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench,
comprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward
Benchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward
models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic
assessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse,
Practical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10
software categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels
(25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through
carefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure
reliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and
Insights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3
prompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including
insufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the
superiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation.
(4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our
comprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that
significantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting
and strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and
93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially
outperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.

Motivation: 传统资助和合同方法过于僵化，与敏捷原则冲突，阻碍客户-承包商合作，并限制盈利能力。

Method: 通过系统文献综述，在SCOPUS、Web of Science和Google Scholar中筛选出38篇相关实证研究。

Result: 确定了四种替代资助和四种替代合同方法，这些方法提高了客户满意度、降低了承包商风险并提升了资源利用效率。

Conclusion: 组织在选择适合的资助和合同方法时，应考虑其领导、人员和系统的准备情况。逐步过渡到完全灵活的方法可能比突然引入变更更有利。

Abstract: Agile software development emphasizes flexibility and iterative processes,
which may conflict with the more linear, rigid, and time-consuming traditional
funding and contracting approaches. This review synthesizes real-life
experiences of using alternative (non-traditional) contracting and funding
approaches. The focus is on identifying approaches that align better with agile
principles and understanding the motivations, benefits, and challenges these
alternatives present. A systematic literature review was conducted in SCOPUS,
Web of Science, and Google Scholar, where we identified 38 relevant
peer-reviewed empirical studies from private and public sector contexts. Four
alternative funding and four alternative contracting approaches were
identified. Organizations were motivated to adopt these alternative approaches
because traditional approaches often proved too rigid, conflicted with agile
principles, hindered effective client-contractor collaboration, and limited
profitability. The benefits of these alternatives included higher client
satisfaction, reduced contractor risk, and more efficient resource utilization.
Adopting alternative funding and contracting approaches may promote flexibility
and efficiency in agile projects but also presents cultural and structural
challenges, increases the risk of scope creep and analysis paralysis, and
requires additional effort in terms of time and resources. The context of the
organization matters highly in selecting a suitable approach, such as the
organizational readiness in terms of its leaders, people, and systems. Thus,
instead of wholly adopting alternative approaches and introducing changes
abruptly, organizations may benefit from starting with hybrid approaches that
balance flexibility and control and progressively transition to fully flexible
approaches tailored to their needs

Motivation: 现有公平性测试方法主要关注测试样本生成器的设计，忽略了数据特征的因果知识，限制了其潜力。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种基于因果推断的通用框架CausalFT，通过提取与敏感特征最直接且因果相关的非敏感特征，并将这种因果关系注入扰动中，指导测试样本生成。

Result: 在1296个案例中，CausalFT显著提升了93%案例的公平性漏洞检测能力，并在64%案例中优于基于相关性的方法，同时运行效率更高。

Conclusion: CausalFT通过因果推断指导扰动，显著提升了现有公平性测试生成器的效果，在大多数情况下优于仅基于相关性的方法，并能更高效地增强模型的抗偏置能力。

Abstract: To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features
(e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in
engineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key
challenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an
intractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing
on designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about
data characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting
their full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing
a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.
Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most
directly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive
counterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a
causal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide
a test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves
as a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.
Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably
improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the
cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art
approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,
CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more
efficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all
cases.

Motivation: LLM4RE领域的数据集存在碎片化和表征不足的问题，限制了其重用和可比性，本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过系统映射研究，识别并分析了43项主要研究中引用的62个公开数据集，沿多个描述符（如工件类型、粒度、RE阶段、任务、领域和语言）对数据集进行表征。

Result: 初步发现多个研究空白，包括对需求获取任务的覆盖有限、管理活动（除追踪外）的数据集稀缺，以及多语言可用性不足。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了LLM4RE领域的数据集公共目录和结构化表征方案，支持数据集的选取、比较和重用，未来工作将扩展至灰色文献及与开放数据集和基准库的整合。

Abstract: [Context] Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on domain-specific datasets to
achieve robust performance across training and inference stages. However, in
Requirements Engineering (RE), data scarcity remains a persistent limitation
reported in surveys and mapping studies. [Question/Problem] Although there are
multiple datasets supporting LLM-based RE tasks (LLM4RE), they are fragmented
and poorly characterized, limiting reuse and comparability. This research
addresses the limited visibility and characterization of datasets used in
LLM4RE. We investigate which public datasets are employed, how they can be
systematically characterized, and which RE tasks and dataset descriptors remain
under-represented. [Ideas/Results] To address this, we conduct a systematic
mapping study to identify and analyse datasets used in LLM4RE research. A total
of 62 publicly available datasets are referenced across 43 primary studies.
Each dataset is characterized along descriptors such as artifact type,
granularity, RE stage, task, domain, and language. Preliminary findings show
multiple research gaps, including limited coverage for elicitation tasks,
scarce datasets for management activities beyond traceability, and limited
multilingual availability. [Contribution] This research preview offers a public
catalogue and structured characterization scheme to support dataset selection,
comparison, and reuse in LLM4RE research. Future work will extend the scope to
grey literature, as well as integration with open dataset and benchmark
repositories.

Conclusion: FeClustRE通过结合混合特征提取、层次聚类和基于LLM的语义标注，提供了一个结构化、有意义的特征表示框架，填补了用户反馈与特征理解之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: [Context and motivation.] Extracting features from mobile app reviews is
increasingly important for multiple requirements engineering (RE) tasks.
However, existing methods struggle to turn noisy, ambiguous feedback into
interpretable insights. [Question/problem.] Syntactic approaches lack semantic
depth, while large language models (LLMs) often miss fine-grained features or
fail to structure them coherently. In addition, existing methods output flat
lists of features without semantic organization, limiting interpretation and
comparability. Consequently, current feature extraction approaches do not
provide structured, meaningful representations of app features. As a result,
practitioners face fragmented information that hinder requirement analysis,
prioritization, and cross-app comparison, among other use cases. [Principal
ideas/results.] In this context, we propose FeClustRE, a framework integrating
hybrid feature extraction, hierarchical clustering with auto-tuning and
LLM-based semantic labelling. FeClustRE combines syntactic parsing with LLM
enrichment, organizes features into clusters, and automatically generates
meaningful taxonomy labels. We evaluate FeClustRE on public benchmarks for
extraction correctness and on a sample study of generative AI assistant app
reviews for clustering quality, semantic coherence, and interpretability.
[Contribution.] Overall, FeClustRE delivers (1) a hybrid framework for feature
extraction and taxonomy generation, (2) an auto-tuning mechanism with a
comprehensive evaluation methodology, and (3) open-source and replicable
implementation. These contributions bridge user feedback and feature
understanding, enabling deeper insights into current and emerging requirements.

TL;DR: AToMIC是一个自动化框架，利用大型语言模型直接从需求生成验收测试工件，显著减少手动工作并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动验收测试仍然是现代软件开发中的瓶颈，特别是在使用Flutter等框架进行跨平台移动开发时。尽管开发者越来越依赖自动化测试工具，但创建和维护验收测试工件仍需要大量手动工作。

Method: AToMIC是一个自动化框架，利用专门的大型语言模型直接从需求（JIRA票证）和最近的代码更改生成Gherkin场景、页面对象和可执行的UI测试脚本。

Result: 在BMW的MyBMW应用中，覆盖了170+屏幕代码库中的13个实际问题，AToMIC在标准硬件上每个功能在5分钟内生成了可执行的测试工件。生成的工件质量高：93.3%的Gherkin场景在生成时语法正确，78.8%的页面对象无需手动编辑即可运行，100%的生成的UI测试成功执行。

Conclusion: AToMIC被证实为工业移动项目中简化验收测试创建和维护的可扩展、实用解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile acceptance testing remains a bottleneck in modern software
development, particularly for cross-platform mobile development using
frameworks like Flutter. While developers increasingly rely on automated
testing tools, creating and maintaining acceptance test artifacts still demands
significant manual effort. To help tackle this issue, we introduce AToMIC, an
automated framework leveraging specialized Large Language Models to generate
Gherkin scenarios, Page Objects, and executable UI test scripts directly from
requirements (JIRA tickets) and recent code changes. Applied to BMW's MyBMW
app, covering 13 real-world issues in a 170+ screen codebase, AToMIC produced
executable test artifacts in under five minutes per feature on standard
hardware. The generated artifacts were of high quality: 93.3% of Gherkin
scenarios were syntactically correct upon generation, 78.8% of PageObjects ran
without manual edits, and 100% of generated UI tests executed successfully. In
a survey, all practitioners reported time savings (often a full developer-day
per feature) and strong confidence in adopting the approach. These results
confirm AToMIC as a scalable, practical solution for streamlining acceptance
test creation and maintenance in industrial mobile projects.

Conclusion: EffiReasonTrans通过两阶段训练策略（监督微调和强化学习）有效提升了代码翻译的准确性，同时平衡了推理延迟，适用于需要人工检查的实际开发工作流。

Abstract: Code translation is a crucial task in software development and maintenance.
While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved
automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of
increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that
involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose
EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy
while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality
reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model,
DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each
(source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and
functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a
two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented
samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and
balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation
pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation
accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while
reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference
latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the
complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally,
EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into
agent-based frameworks. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/EffiReasonTrans.
