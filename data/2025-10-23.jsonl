It is also crucial for visualization, as many methods\nrequire vertices to be arranged in a well-defined order to reveal non-trivial\npatterns. The goal of vertex ordering methods is to preserve neighborhood\nrelations, but the structural complexity of real-world graphs often introduces\ndistortions. Comparing different ordering methods is therefore essential to\nidentify the most suitable one for each application. Existing metrics for\nassessing spatial vertex ordering typically focus on global quality, which\nhinders the identification of localized distortions. Visual evaluation is\nparticularly valuable, as it allows analysts to compare methods within a single\nvisualization, assess distortions, identify anomalous regions, and, in urban\ncontexts, explain spatial inconsistencies. This work presents a\nvisualization-assisted tool for assessing vertex ordering techniques, with a\nfocus on urban analytics. We evaluate geometric and topological ordering\napproaches using urban street graphs. The visual tool integrates existing and\nnewly proposed metrics, validated through experiments on data from multiple\ncities. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively supports\nusers in selecting suitable vertex ordering techniques, tuning hyperparameters,\nand identifying regions with high ordering distortions."}

DML's predictable traffic pattern\nprovides a great oppotunity for applying optical network technology. Existing\noptical interconnects-based CC schemes adopt ``one-shot network\nreconfiguration'', which provisions static high-capacity topologies for an\nentire collective operation -- sometimes for a full training iteration.\nHowever, this approach faces significant scalability limitations when\nsupporting more complex and efficient CC algorithms required for modern\nworkloads: the ``one-shot'' strategies either demand excessive resource\noverprovisioning or suffer performance degradation due to rigid resource\nallocation.\n  To address these challenges, we propose SWOT, a demand-aware optical network\nframework. SWOT employs ``intra-collective reconfiguration'' and can\ndynamically align network resources with CC traffic patterns. SWOT incorporates\na novel scheduling technique that overlaps optical switch reconfigurations with\nongoing transmissions, and improves communication efficiency.

Although prior works have focused on\nindividual stages, comprehensive comparisons of full ETL workflows across\nprogramming languages using Apache Iceberg remain limited. The analysis was\nperformed by executing several operations, including downloading data from CSV\nfiles, transforming and loading it into an Apache Iceberg analytical table. It\nwas found that the performance of the Spark algorithm varies significantly\ndepending on the amount of data and the programming language used. When\nprocessing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71\nseconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of\n9.62 seconds. For processing a large CSV file of 1.6 gigabytes, all programming\nlanguages demonstrated similar results: the fastest performance was showed in\nPython: 46.34 seconds, while Scala and Java showed results of 47.72 and 50.56\nseconds, respectively. When performing a more complex operation that involved\ncombining two CSV files into a single dataset for further loading into an\nApache Iceberg table, Scala demonstrated the highest performance, at 374.42\nseconds. Java processing was completed in 379.8 seconds, while Python was the\nleast efficient, with a runtime of 398.32 seconds. It follows that the\nprogramming language significantly affects the efficiency of data processing by\nthe Apache Spark algorithm, with Scala and Java being more productive for\nprocessing large amounts of data and complex operations, while Python\ndemonstrates an advantage in working with small amounts of data. The results\nobtained can be useful for optimizing data handling processes depending on\nspecific performance requirements and the amount of information being\nprocessed."}

In this work, we study the\nlocality of matching problems in the family of regular graphs, which is one of\nthe main benchmarks for establishing lower bounds on the locality of\nsymmetry-breaking problems, as well as for obtaining classification results.\nFor approximate matching, we develop randomized algorithms to show that $(1 +\n\\epsilon)$-approximate matching in regular graphs is truly local; i.e., the\nlocality depends only on $\\epsilon$ and is independent of all other graph\nparameters. Furthermore, as long as the degree $\\Delta$ is not very small\n(namely, as long as $\\Delta \\geq \\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$), this dependence is\nonly logarithmic in $1/\\epsilon$. This stands in sharp contrast to maximal\nmatching in regular graphs which requires some dependence on the number of\nnodes $n$ or the degree $\\Delta$.

Previous work established one-way reductions\nshowing how suffix array queries can be answered using, for example, rank\nqueries on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform.

However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single\nDC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under\nthis, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due\nto the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations\nattempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit\nin low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.\nTherefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical\nroadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.\n  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize\nEP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the\nspatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and\nfrequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is\nnon-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original\ncommunication pattern by mixing data and expert communication.

Guided\nby this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct\nthe mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU\nlevel, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by\nreducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining\nall these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better\nscalability.

Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a\ntransformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D\nbrain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,\nstandard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor\nregions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous\nboundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on\nhigh-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high\ncomputational resources and often faces challenges associated with class\nimbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into\nthe 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and\nprioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a\ntumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is\nutilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.\nThis study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,\nultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis.

In this work, we study the\nlocality of matching problems in the family of regular graphs, which is one of\nthe main benchmarks for establishing lower bounds on the locality of\nsymmetry-breaking problems, as well as for obtaining classification results.\nFor approximate matching, we develop randomized algorithms to show that $(1 +\n\\epsilon)$-approximate matching in regular graphs is truly local; i.e., the\nlocality depends only on $\\epsilon$ and is independent of all other graph\nparameters. Furthermore, as long as the degree $\\Delta$ is not very small\n(namely, as long as $\\Delta \\geq \\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$), this dependence is\nonly logarithmic in $1/\\epsilon$. This stands in sharp contrast to maximal\nmatching in regular graphs which requires some dependence on the number of\nnodes $n$ or the degree $\\Delta$.

While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to\npredict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of\nacquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we\nintroduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D\ninformation while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that\nby synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we\ncan regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve\nthis, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of\nreal hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.\nUnlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines\ngrasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping\ndatasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%\nover existing image-based methods.

In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we\npropose \\textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that\nleverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical\nvisual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations.

As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a\nreality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area.\nWhile early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related\nactivities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a range of\nsocio-technical concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to\nthe emerging community vision by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope\nbeyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations\nand evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary\nset of values and principles to guide efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on\ndesigning/using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE.

While our survey is not the first\nof its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive\nperspective of 4D representations\\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time\nwhile exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an\nexhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by\nfocusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and\nensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,\napplication, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to\nthe readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D\nrepresentations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D\nrepresentations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.\nOur discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of\ntoday, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),\nbut also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D\ncontext, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our\nsurvey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video\nfoundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our\ndiscussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We\nalso provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,\nas well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward.

In\ncontrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,\npartial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer\nbroader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation\nlearning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these\nchallenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement\nlearning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the\nperformance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline\nRL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under\nthe sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,\nsimple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,\nwithout significant additional assumptions.

Most black-box\nevaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying\nmechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search\nparadigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether\nMLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are\ndetected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments\ntargeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs\nexhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single\nfeature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)\nsearch. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate\nnatural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations.
