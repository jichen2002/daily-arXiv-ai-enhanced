Method: 综述了降维技术，特别是特征提取方法，以解决高维数据带来的挑战。

Result: 降维技术在地球观测数据价值链中具有广泛的应用潜力，包括数据压缩、清洗、融合、可视化、异常检测和预测等任务。

Conclusion: 本文综述了降维技术在地球观测数据价值链中的应用，并指出了未来研究中尚未充分探索的降维算法及其应用机会。

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种通过神经网络生成的隐蔽基准标记，适用于增强现实、机器人等领域，能在多种环境中自然隐藏并提供可靠的位置跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美观性和隐蔽性上的不足，促使其开发一种能自然融入环境的神经生成标记。

Method: 通过端到端的深度学习流程，包括编码器网络和检测模块，生成和检测Ninja Codes。

Result: 实验证明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能可靠跟踪位置，并成功隐藏在多样环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes 提供了一种隐蔽且可靠的6自由度位置跟踪方法，适用于多种应用场景，尤其是在传统标记不美观或不适用的情况下。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段视觉语言问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文接地显著提升了预训练模型在高级驾驶问答中的表现，实验结果显示其优于基线模型并在视觉损坏下保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自动驾驶中高级感知、预测和规划问题的问答需求，开发一个基于视觉语言模型的可靠系统。

Method: 论文提出了一种两阶段的视觉语言问答系统。第一阶段使用大型多模态LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-32B）处理六摄像头输入、短时间历史窗口和带有少样本示例的思维链提示。第二阶段通过添加nuScenes场景元数据和类别特定问题指令（感知、预测、规划任务的单独提示）来增强提示。

Result: 在驾驶问答基准测试中，该方法显著优于基线Qwen2.5模型。例如，第一阶段使用5个历史帧和10样本提示的总体准确率为65.1%（零样本为62.61%）；应用自一致性后提升至66.85%。第二阶段达到67.37%的总体准确率。系统在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和上下文接地可以显著提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答中的表现。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D是一种高效的状态空间架构，用于处理不规则时间间隔的纵向医学图像，显著提升了乳腺癌风险预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前方法在建模高分辨率图像序列和不规则时间间隔时的不足，充分利用数据中的空间和时间线索。

Method: 模型的核心创新是一个连续时间选择性扫描机制，明确将检查之间的真实时间差整合到状态转换中，并辅以多尺度3D邻域融合模块，以捕捉时空关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，模型表现优于现有的循环、变换器和状态空间模型，验证c-index提高了2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分更高。

Conclusion: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D 提出了一种新的状态空间架构，能够有效处理纵向医学成像中的不规则时间间隔和高分辨率图像序列，同时在计算上保持高效，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出运动中心对齐框架，提升视频扩散模型的物理合理性，同时保持文本忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型在生成时间连贯和物理合理的运动方面存在不足，主要原因是模型对自然视频中复杂运动的理解不足。

Method: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，从预训练的视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，并将其与文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征对齐。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等数据集上的实证评估及用户研究中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过运动中心对齐框架，文本到视频扩散模型能够生成更具物理合理性的视频，同时保持对文本提示的忠实度。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个基于场景图的详细图像描述评估指标，通过DOCENT数据集验证其在艺术领域的有效性，优于现有指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标准指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本中的属性和关系错误，需要更敏感的评估方法。

Method: 使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，引导LLMs-as-a-Judge生成基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上比现有指标（包括GPT4o-as-a-Judge）更接近人类评分，且在不同图像类型上表现稳健。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT的引入为评估详细图像描述提供了新的工具和基准，尤其是在艺术领域，展示了PoSh在人类评分相关性、鲁棒性和作为奖励函数方面的优势。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

Conclusion: UniHPR 提出了一种统一的人类姿态表示学习管道，通过创新性的基于奇异值的对比学习损失，显著提升了多模态对齐的效果，并在2D和3D人体姿态估计任务中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在分割不规则形状和模糊边界的肿瘤区域时存在挑战，且高分辨率MRI数据训练需要大量计算资源并面临类别不平衡问题。

Method: 研究将注意力机制整合到3D U-Net模型中，并利用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种集成注意力机制的3D U-Net模型，显著提高了脑肿瘤分割的准确性，为临床诊断提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性死亡的主要原因，早期检测和准确诊断至关重要。然而，敏感的医疗数据使得开发准确且私密的人工智能模型具有挑战性。

Method: 应用联邦近端（FedProx）方法于非IID超声乳腺癌成像数据集，并结合带有注意力机制的改进U-Net模型。

Result: 全局模型达到了96%的准确率，证明了该方法在提高肿瘤分割准确性和保护患者隐私方面的有效性。

Conclusion: FedProx方法显示出在非IID本地医学数据集上训练精确机器学习模型的潜力，同时保持了患者隐私。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于跨第一人称视角的多智能体战术学习，效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多依赖第三人称视角，忽视了同步的第一人称多智能体学习。

Method: 提出了Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL)，通过对齐队友的第一人称视觉流来培养团队战术意识。

Result: 在队友和对手位置预测任务中，CECL表现出色，提升了单个第一人称视角下的推理能力。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为跨第一人称视角的多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，并在游戏理解中为多智能体建模和战术学习提供了测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

TL;DR: 论文通过六种深度卷积网络自动检测疟疾，其中Residual Attention Network和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率超过97%，为减少人工误诊提供了高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显微镜观察血液涂片图像的疟疾诊断方法因专业知识和技能的不足以及人工干预可能导致误诊，因此需要计算机辅助的自动诊断方法。

Method: 应用了六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、Residual Attention Network、DenseNet-121和Custom-CNN）从血液细胞图像中提取深层特征并进行分类。

Result: Residual Attention Network和XceptionNet在公开的疟疾细胞图像数据集上表现最佳，准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，超越了其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的自动诊断方法，特别是Residual Attention Network和XceptionNet，在疟疾检测中表现出色，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%，为减少人工干预提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决MLLM幻觉问题的方法通常引入额外计算成本，而PruneHal通过优化注意力分配来避免这一问题。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存修剪增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注。

Result: 在多个主流MLLM上评估，PruneHal在幻觉缓解任务中表现出色且稳健。

Conclusion: PruneHal是一种无需额外训练、计算成本低且模型无关的方法，通过自适应KV缓存修剪有效减少了MLLM中的幻觉现象。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 传统奖励函数主要关注提升整个生成视频序列的质量（如美学吸引力和整体一致性），但在图像到视频（I2V）生成任务中，时间一致性往往受到影响，因此需要一种新指标来专门增强时间一致性。

Method: 定义视频一致性距离（VCD）于视频帧特征的频率空间中，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并利用奖励微调框架对模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验结果表明，使用VCD微调视频生成模型显著提升了时间一致性，且未降低其他性能。

Conclusion: 通过提出视频一致性距离（VCD）作为新指标，并结合奖励微调框架，显著提升了视频生成模型的时间一致性，同时不影响其他性能表现。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive 是一个创新的3D感知视频编辑框架，用于生成多视角逼真视频以提升自动驾驶感知任务，尤其是在极端情况下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注生成质量和可控性，但忽略了自动驾驶下游感知任务的评估，而这对性能至关重要。合成数据的使用通常需要额外的训练周期，但直接增加基线训练的周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive 首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，随后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，并通过微调驾驶世界模型生成多视角、逼真的编辑视频。

Result: Dream4Drive 能够大规模生成多视角极端情况，显著提升自动驾驶中的极端情况感知能力。实验证明，该方法在不同训练周期下均能有效提升下游感知模型的性能。

Conclusion: Dream4Drive 通过创新的3D感知视频编辑框架，显著提升了自动驾驶下游感知任务的性能，尤其是在处理极端情况（corner cases）方面。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在多样场景中表现不一致，缺乏统一的有效解决方案，因此提出MoE-GS以整合多种专家模型，解决动态挑战。

Method: 提出MoE-GS框架，通过Volume-aware Pixel Router动态混合多个专家模型的输出，并采用可微分权重splatting技术实现时空一致性。进一步通过单次多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略优化效率。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的实验表明，MoE-GS在渲染质量和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS通过整合多种专家模型和创新的Volume-aware Pixel Router，在动态场景重建中取得了优于现有方法的性能，尽管模型容量增加和FPS降低是其固有缺点，但通过单次多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略，有效提升了效率和轻量部署能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

Motivation: 4D成像雷达虽具有低成本、长距离检测和准确速度测量等优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示和多模态融合。

Method: 引入SFGFusion网络，通过估计图像和雷达数据的二次曲面参数，增强空间表示和跨模态交互。预测的深度用于图像分支和表面伪点分支，分别提升空间映射精度和缓解雷达点稀疏性。最后使用标准2D主干和检测头预测物体标签和边界框。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合模型有效融合相机和4D雷达数据，显著提升了3D物体检测性能，并在TJ4DRadSet和VoD基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在SpotGEO数据集上取得了90.14%的F1分数，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

Conclusion: FadeLead通过将背景上下文封装到紧凑的前景特征中，有效解决了带宽限制下的协作感知问题，实验证明其在各种带宽设置下均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 提出的SR框架通过结合ControlNet机制和混合损失函数，有效提升了单步扩散模型的结构完整性和真实感，同时在推理速度上保持高效。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Conclusion: MobiAct框架在保持高识别准确率的同时，显著降低了计算成本和能耗，实现了资源受限MAV平台上的高效动作识别。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Conclusion: 提出的D2D框架通过将非可微的检测模型转化为可微的批评器，显著提升了文本到图像扩散模型在对象计数方面的准确性，同时保持了图像质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Conclusion: RIL通过结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，成功缩小了轻量级VLM与顶尖闭源VLM的性能差距，并在某些情况下超越它们。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管驾驶世界模型取得了显著进展，但其在自主系统中的潜力尚未充分开发：世界模型主要用于世界模拟，与轨迹规划脱节。论文旨在探索世界建模与规划的协同促进机制。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过联合建模水深和海床分类，显著提升了浅水区测绘的精度和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将水深或海床分类任务孤立处理，放弃了它们的交互带来的共同利益，并阻碍了深度学习方法的广泛应用。

Method: Seabed-Net采用双分支编码器分别进行水深估计和像素级海床分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并通过动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质性沿海区域的广泛评估中，Seabed-Net在传统经验模型和机器学习回归方法上表现优异，RMSE降低高达75%，相比单任务和多任务基线，水深RMSE降低10-30%，海床分类精度提升高达8%。

Conclusion: Seabed-Net通过联合建模深度、底质和海床生境，实现了协同增益，为浅水区集成测绘提供了稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP通过多层融合方法，无需VAE路径，显著减少参数并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑的功能层次结构不符，需要参数密集的VAE路径。

Method: 引入参数高效的多层融合方法，结合Cross-Reconstruction策略和多粒度损失函数，将fMRI信号与CLIP的中间和最终层对齐。

Result: BrainMCLIP在高层语义指标上表现优异，参数减少71.7%，无需VAE路径即可捕捉常被忽略的视觉细节。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP通过参数高效的多层融合方法，无需额外的VAE路径，即可在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得平衡，显著减少参数数量。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种无需训练的开放词汇图像分割和对象识别框架，以解决现有方法在无需训练数据时的局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：首先通过EfficientNetB0进行无监督图像分割，然后利用CLIP进行开放词汇对象识别。第一阶段使用奇异值分解和层次聚类分割图像，第二阶段通过CLIP的视觉-语言对齐进行识别。

Result: 在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，包括匈牙利mIoU、精确度、召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 该框架在COCO、ADE20K和PASCAL VOC等标准基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性、灵活性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Method: 提出DaMo（数据混合优化器），利用可训练网络预测任何给定数据集比例的下游任务性能，从而确定最佳数据混合配置。

Result: DaMo在PhoneAgentBench上实现了3.38%的性能提升，在其他基准测试中平均得分优于其他方法2.57%，在BFCL-v3任务中指标提升12.47%。

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 深度学习方法在医学图像配准中虽表现优异，但常忽略正则化在确保鲁棒性和解剖学合理性中的关键作用。

Method: 提出DARE（可变形自适应正则化估计器）框架，动态调整基于变形场梯度范数的弹性正则化，集成应变和剪切能量项，并引入折叠预防机制。

Result: DARE框架有效减少了非物理伪影（如折叠），避免了过度平滑，提升了配准精度和解剖学合理性。

Conclusion: DARE框架通过动态调整弹性正则化，结合应变和剪切能量项以及折叠预防机制，显著提高了医学图像配准的准确性和解剖学合理性。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

Motivation: 保护 NeRF 模型的知识产权，防止未经授权的应用，同时避免渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出 AegisRF 框架，包括扰动场（注入对抗性扰动）和敏感性场（自适应约束几何扰动）。

Result: 实验证明 AegisRF 在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用性，且保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF 通过引入可学习的敏感性和扰动场，有效保护了 NeRF 模型的 IP，同时保持了渲染质量。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

Motivation: 现有的 VLM 评估主要集中于单视角场景，而多视角输入在机器人推理中的有效性尚未得到充分探索。多摄像头设置在机器人平台中日益普及，但 VLM 能否有效利用多视角输入仍是一个未解问题。

Method: 通过构建 MV-RoboBench（包含 1.7k 个手动整理的 QA 项目，涵盖 8 个子任务），评估了包括开源和闭源模型在内的多种 VLM，并测试了结合 CoT 技术的增强版本。

Result: 评估结果显示，当前最先进的模型性能远低于人类水平，且空间智能与机器人任务执行在多视角场景中呈正相关。此外，现有通用单视角空间理解基准的强表现并不能可靠地转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench 的引入揭示了当前最先进的视觉语言模型在多视角机器人感知任务中的局限性，并强调了空间智能与机器人任务执行之间的正相关关系。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: ReCAME-Net 在 IC-Defect-14 数据集上表现优于现有最先进模型，同时在通用公共数据集上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）框架能够生成具有精确控制属性的代表性孔隙尺度图像，显著解决了孔隙尺度图像的代表性和数据稀缺问题，为地下表征提供了革命性工具。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Conclusion: 该研究通过生成模型预测目标对比图像，为MRI加速引入了一种新的预测成像范式，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

Motivation: 当前基于视频的方法在处理序列时孤立处理，未能利用跨序列中普遍存在的结构规律和重复运动模式。

Method: PRGCN采用图记忆库学习并存储一组紧凑的姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索这些原型作为结构化先验，并与硬编码的解剖学约束自适应融合。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中，PRGCN分别达到了37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，展示了卓越的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: PRGCN通过跨序列模式复用机制，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的性能，并在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉令牌占总令牌的97-99%，即使低分辨率图像已足够时，仍带来高计算和延迟。

Method: CARES使用紧凑的视觉语言模型（350M）提取特征，并预测目标预训练VLM的响应何时收敛至其峰值能力。尽管训练时是基于一组可选分辨率的离散分类器，但在推理时能插值连续分辨率以实现精细控制。

Result: 在涵盖文档和自然图像的五个多模态基准测试中，CARES在保持任务性能的同时，计算开销降低了高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES作为一种轻量级预处理模块，能够有效预测图像-查询对的最小输入分辨率，从而在保持任务性能的同时显著降低计算开销。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

*Julia Wąsala,Joannes D. Maasakkers,Ilse Aben,Rochelle Schneider,Holger Hoos,Mitra Baratchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in methane plume detection from satellite images by using imputation and resampling, improving detection in low-coverage images without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the representation bias in automated feature extraction models caused by systematically missing pixels (MNAR) in satellite images, which can lead to under-detection of methane plumes in low-coverage images.

Method: The paper evaluates multiple imputation approaches and proposes a weighted resampling scheme during training to enforce class balance in each coverage bin, thereby removing the association between label and coverage.

Result: The results indicate that both resampling and imputation techniques significantly reduce representation bias, with debiased models performing better in detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that both resampling and imputation techniques can effectively reduce representation bias in methane plume detection models without compromising balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. The debiased models show improved performance in detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

Conclusion: Cauvis方法通过视觉提示和跨注意力模块有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的虚假相关性问题，显著提升了模型在未见目标域中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的多模态协同学习框架在单模态推理场景中表现出色，验证了其在多样化地球观测应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Motivation: 现有方法在图像对重叠较小或无重叠时表现不佳，生成的中间帧模糊且选择策略效率低。

Method: 提出了Hybrid Video Generation (HVG)方法，结合视频插值模型和姿态条件的新视图合成模型，以及基于特征匹配的Feature Matching Selector (FMS)来选择适合姿态估计的中间帧。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过结合视频插值和姿态条件的新视图合成模型，显著提升了稀疏重叠图像对的姿态估计性能，尤其是在重叠较小或无重叠的情况下。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在医学图像中的定位能力（即文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度），这对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 通过交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域的对齐情况。

Result: 研究表明：（1）所有VLM变体对于大而明确的病理表现出合理的定位能力，但对于小或弥散性病变性能显著下降；（2）在胸部X射线特定数据集上预训练的模型相比通用领域数据训练的模型表现出更好的对齐；（3）模型的整体识别能力与定位能力高度相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像理解中表现出强大的识别能力，但在临床可靠的定位能力上仍有不足，强调了在医学实践中部署前需要有针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

Motivation: 尽管VLMs在多项下游任务中表现优异，但在视觉推理（如空间关系、时间序列和对象计数）方面仍存在局限，需深入探究其失败原因并提升推理能力。

Method: 研究了七种最先进的VLMs在计数任务中的推理能力，进行了分层分析，并针对输出层进行了微调。

Result: VLMs对对象数量、类型、空间排列及干扰物高度敏感，错误主要源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射不正确。

Conclusion: 通过针对输出层的微调，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在计数任务中的准确性可提升高达21%，且在真实数据集上表现一致。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Method: 通过合成实验和理论推导，研究提示复杂性对合成数据效用的影响，并引入新的评估框架。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

Result: HAD在实验中一致优于现有最先进方法，消融研究验证了各设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD框架通过层次化对齐策略有效解决了RGB相机与事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，显著提升了多模态集成的效果，并在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个通过RGBA视频alpha通道的无盒对抗攻击方法{\alpha}-Cloak，成功在多种模型上实现了100%的攻击成功率，揭示了视频感知系统的新漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物体检测模型在自动驾驶汽车和监控平台等系统中的广泛应用，确保其安全性对抗对抗性威胁变得至关重要。目前针对视频域的无盒对抗攻击研究较少，尤其是通过alpha通道的攻击。

Method: 通过利用RGBA视频的alpha通道，将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计了一种视觉隐形且兼容的融合算法。

Result: 在五种最先进的物体检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型上测试，攻击成功率达到100%。

Conclusion: 该论文揭示了视频感知系统中alpha通道的潜在安全漏洞，并强调了在对抗性环境中考虑alpha通道防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Motivation: 环绕视图自动驾驶场景重建面临确保泛化能力的同时提升新视图质量的核心挑战，现有方法难以保证几何一致性和重建质量。

Method: VGD框架通过轻量级VGGT变体提取几何先验，设计高斯头融合多尺度几何令牌预测高斯参数，并整合多尺度特征联合监督语义细化模型，实现特征一致性学习。

Conclusion: VGD框架在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，其在客观指标和主观质量上均显著优于现有方法，验证了其高保真环绕视图重建的可扩展性和优越性。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接利用MLLMs的注意力图进行视频定位时，发现原始注意力图噪声多且与对象区域对齐差，需改进。

Method: 提出Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF)，通过对比性对象-背景融合和互补视频帧融合机制，优化注意力图，并引入注意力引导的SAM2提示。

Result: DecAF在参考和推理VOS基准测试中优于无训练方法，性能接近有训练方法。

Conclusion: DecAF方法通过对比性对象-背景融合和互补视频帧融合，显著提升了注意力图的质量，无需额外训练即可生成粗分割掩码，并结合SAM2提示获得细粒度掩码，性能优于无训练方法，接近有训练方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的单一确定性定位图缺乏精确性和可靠性，无法满足高要求应用（如法医分析和安全监控）的需求。

Method: CBDiff引入了条件伯努利扩散模型，结合伯努利噪声和时间步交叉注意力机制（TSCAttention），以生成多样化的伪造定位图。

Result: 在八个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CBDiff展示了在图像伪造定位任务中的显著优势，尤其在处理不确定性和变异性方面表现突出，具备实际应用的强大潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器在框架中不足以适应复杂信号的规律性，尤其是对于边缘为分段$\bf C^\alpha$曲线的卡通图像。深度卷积神经网络虽取得较好结果，但需要更简化的模型。

Method: 引入了一种去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同子集的散射系数的$\ell^1$范数。散射系数是通过对小波系数的模进行第二次小波变换计算得到的。

Result: 数值实验表明，该去噪估计器在所有Lipschitz指数$\alpha \leq 2$下达到了极小极大渐近界，并提出了一个数学猜想。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同子集的$\ell^1$范数，能够捕捉图像的不同几何规律性。数值实验表明，该方法在所有Lipschitz指数$\alpha \leq 2$下达到了极小极大渐近界，并提出了一个数学猜想。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Method: 提出了一种新颖的生成通信机制（GenComm），包括可变形消息提取器、空间感知特征生成器和通道增强器。

Result: 在OPV2V-H、DAIR-V2X和V2X-Real数据集上，GenComm优于现有方法，新智能体集成成本降低81%。

Conclusion: GenComm通过特征生成和轻量级空间信息对齐，实现了异构多智能体系统间的无缝感知，显著降低了计算成本和参数数量。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法面临数据稀缺、边界模糊和语义区分不足三大瓶颈，导致模型陷入局部最优。AMR旨在通过增强数据注释和提升边界/语义区分能力来解决这些问题。

Method: AMR采用零外部依赖的增强时刻检索框架，包括冷启动和蒸馏适应两阶段训练。冷启动阶段通过课程学习增强数据，建立基础边界/语义意识；蒸馏阶段引入原始查询和主动查询双重查询集，结合跨阶段蒸馏损失确保知识一致性。

Result: 实验表明，AMR在多个基准测试中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: AMR框架通过两阶段训练和双重查询集设计，显著提升了现有时刻检索方法的性能，特别是在边界模糊和语义区分方面的表现。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中优于最近的通用和医学VLMs。

Conclusion: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了泛化能力。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

Motivation: 3D-GS在复杂场景中因梯度稀释和原始冻结现象导致过重建问题，表现为局部模糊和针状扭曲。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包括重要性感知的密度化标准和自适应参数扰动机制，以重新激活停滞的原始增长和冻结的原始。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS不仅解决了3D-GS的局限性，其重新激活机制还展示了在其他3D-GS变体中的广泛适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Motivation: 现有的无配对图像翻译方法在医学成像中常常扭曲细小的曲线结构，如微血管，影响诊断可靠性和定量分析。CST 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CST 通过增加一个曲线提取模块来提供拓扑监督，可以无缝集成到现有方法中，如 CycleGAN 和 UNSB。

Result: 在三种成像模态（光学相干断层扫描血管造影、彩色眼底和 X 射线冠状动脉造影）上的综合评估表明，CST 提高了翻译的保真度并达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CST 通过在训练中整合结构一致性，为医学成像中的曲线结构感知跨域翻译建立了一个原则性途径，显著提升了翻译的保真度和性能。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术为基于深度学习的面部PAD系统提供了视觉解释，增强了系统的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT通过两阶段框架（时空注意力编码+稳定性优化）从视频中提取鲁棒且可解释的动态变量，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取系统的真实动态变量面临诸多视觉干扰（如背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化），因此需要一种鲁棒且稳定的潜在表示学习方法。

Method: LyTimeT采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用基于TimeSformer的自动编码器，通过全局注意力抑制干扰变化；第二阶段通过线性相关分析和Lyapunov稳定性正则化，优化潜在空间的物理意义和稳定性。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，且对背景扰动保持不变性，预测误差最低。

Conclusion: LyTimeT结合时空注意力和稳定性约束，不仅提高了预测准确性，还增强了模型的物理可解释性。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: ADQ是一种自适应混合精度量化框架，通过动态码本适应和敏感性指导的混合精度分配，显著提升量化模型性能，尤其在资源受限设备上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法面临激活分布高度非均匀和权重量化静态码本不匹配的挑战，ADQ旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ADQ采用了一种混合精度量化框架，包括基于分位数的初始化方法、基于指数移动平均的在线码本适应机制以及敏感性指导的混合精度分配策略。对于激活函数，还集成了硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射方案。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18在平均位宽仅为2.81比特的情况下达到71.512%的Top-1准确率，优于同类方法。CIFAR-10上的消融研究也验证了各创新组件的贡献。

Conclusion: ADQ通过其创新的自适应权重量化方案和混合精度分配策略，显著提升了量化模型的性能，尤其在资源受限设备上表现出色。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Motivation: 为了解决多模态人体运动生成中的一致性和控制问题，并提升生成内容的真实性和多样性。

Method: 提出了一个基于自回归扩散变换器的统一序列到序列框架，并引入参考运动作为新的条件信号。此外，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突。

Result: OmniMotion-X 在多种任务中表现出色，支持交互式生成逼真且可控的运动。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X 在多种多模态任务中显著优于现有方法，展示了最先进的性能，并能够交互式生成逼真、连贯且可控的长时间运动。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法在长尾分布和语义相似类混淆问题上表现不佳，需要一种轻量级框架来提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了CPL-NC框架，包括类感知原型缓存模块和负对比学习机制，通过动态调整原型缓存和优化文本原型来提升模型性能。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC框架通过动态调整原型缓存和负对比学习机制，显著提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，并在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在文本引导图像编辑方面取得了显著进展，但缺乏大规模、高质量、开放的真实图像数据集限制了研究进展。

Method: 通过利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages集合中生成多样化的编辑对，并采用细粒度的图像编辑分类法、MLLM质量评分和精心策划来确保质量和多样性。

Result: 构建了包含400K图像的Pico-Banana-400K数据集，包含三个专用子集，支持复杂编辑场景的研究。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K数据集为训练和评估下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了大规模、高质量且任务丰富的资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Motivation: 单目深度估计是一个快速发展的任务，但如何评估其准确性仍是一个未解决的问题，现有文献缺乏标准化，且多种评估指标的权衡和行为未被充分理解。

Method: 论文通过定量分析现有度量标准对地面真实值不同类型扰动的敏感性，特别是与人类判断的比较，揭示了现有度量标准对曲率扰动（如使平坦表面波浪化）的严重不敏感性。

Result: 分析显示现有度量标准对曲率扰动严重不敏感，为解决这一问题，论文提出了一个新的度量标准。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个新的基于相对表面法线的度量标准，以解决现有度量标准对曲率扰动不敏感的问题，并提供了新的深度可视化工具和创建复合度量标准的方法，以更好地与人类判断对齐。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

Motivation: 当前基准测试缺乏真实世界场景中的运动复杂性、遮挡模式和对象多样性，ITTO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过多阶段流程收集高质量人工标注的视频，这些视频来自现有数据集和以自我为中心的真实世界记录。

Result: 现有跟踪方法在ITTO上表现不佳，特别是在遮挡后重新识别点时，揭示了关键的失败模式。

Conclusion: ITTO被设计为一个基础测试平台，旨在推动点跟踪技术的发展，并指导开发更鲁棒的跟踪算法。

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking

Motivation: 受人类和动物学习中因错误而快速修正的启发，旨在通过情感信号提升大型语言模型（LLM）的代码生成能力。

Method: 使用轻量级多层感知机（MLP）标记代码生成轨迹的情感效价和惊喜度，通过优先级重放和修剪机制优化学习过程。

Result: 在 HumanEval 和 BigCodeBench 等基准测试中，幻觉代码减少 48%，自我修正速度提升 45%。

Conclusion: CosmoCore 通过整合情感信号显著减少了代码生成中的幻觉错误，并加速了自我修正，为情感感知的代码助手提供了新的框架。

Abstract: We introduce CosmoCore, a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning (RL)
architecture that integrates affective signals to enhance code generation in
large language models (LLMs). Motivated by human and animal learning where
embarrassment from mistakes drives rapid correction, as observed in training a
puppy to avoid repeating errors after a single scolding CosmoCore tags code
generation trajectories with valence and surprise using a lightweight
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). High-negative valence (cringe) episodes, such as
buggy code outputs, are prioritized in a Dream Queue for five-fold replay
during off-policy updates, while low-surprise successes are pruned to prevent
overconfidence and buffer bloat. Evaluated on code generation benchmarks like
HumanEval and BigCodeBench, alongside simulations with a custom data pipeline
environment, CosmoCore reduces hallucinated code (e.g., syntax errors or
logical bugs) by 48\% and accelerates self-correction by 45\%. Local
experiments using Hugging Face models in a PySpark environment validate these
gains, with code snippets provided for replication. Ablations confirm valence
tagging boosts curiosity in exploration, and pruning mitigates inefficiency.
This framework extends RL from human feedback (RLHF) for more emotionally aware
code assistants, with applications in IDEs and data pipelines. Code and the
custom mini-world simulation are released.

Method: 通过一项大规模研究，比较了基础编译器反馈、标准单元测试反馈和先进的LLM生成反馈在学生感知质量和学习表现上的差异。

Result: 学生认为单元测试反馈最有帮助，但AI生成的反馈显著提升了学习表现。

Conclusion: 结合单元测试和AI驱动的反馈机制可以优化自动化反馈系统，提升编程教育的学习效果。

Abstract: With the recent rapid increase in digitization across all major industries,
acquiring programming skills has increased the demand for introductory
programming courses. This has further resulted in universities integrating
programming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only
technical studies but also business and management fields of study.
  Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and
tutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of
this, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing
scalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and
instant feedback. Commonly, APASs heavily rely on predefined unit tests for
generating feedback, often limiting the scope and level of detail of feedback
that can be provided to students. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
in recent years, new opportunities have emerged as these technologies can
enhance feedback quality and personalization.
  To investigate how different feedback mechanisms in APASs are perceived by
students, and how effective they are in supporting problem-solving, we have
conducted a large-scale study with over 200 students from two different
universities. Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard
Unit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality
and impact on student performance.
  Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most
helpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances.
These findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize
automated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming
education.

TL;DR: 该论文将RCPSP与MBSE和异质功能图论（HFGT）结合，构建了一个翻译流程，并证明了RCPSP可作为更广泛模型的特殊情况。通过实例验证，该方法在保持经典优势的同时，提供了更丰富的监控和控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限项目调度问题（RCPSP）虽然是项目管理的核心，但与基于模型的系统工程（MBSE）文献脱节，限制了其在复杂系统设计和管理中的整合。

Method: 构建了一个从活动节点网络到SysML活动图，再到操作数网络的具体翻译流程，并将异质功能网络最小成本流（HFNMCF）公式专门应用于RCPSP上下文。

Result: 在具有可再生和不可再生操作数的实例中，专门的HFNMCF产生了类似的时间表，同时提供了项目状态的明确解释，实现了更丰富的监控和控制。

Conclusion: 该论文的框架在保留经典RCPSP优势的同时，能够适应现实世界中的约束和大型复杂项目中遇到的决策过程。

Abstract: Within the project management context, project scheduling serves as an
indispensable component, functioning as a fundamental tool for planning,
monitoring, controlling, and managing projects more broadly. Although the
resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of
project management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader
literature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its
integration into the design and management of complex systems. The original
contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the
RCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems
engineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation
pipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then
to an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the
hetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP
context as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that
the RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an
illustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the
specialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit
explanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.
Overall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while
accommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes
encountered in large, complex megaprojects.

Motivation: 现有自动化解决方案在CPS需求关注提取中的有效性评估缺乏公平和全面的基准。

Method: 提出ReqEBench基准，包含2,721条来自12个真实世界CPS的需求，并进行严格的注释过程。

Result: 研究发现GPT-4在实体关注提取中的最高F1分数仅为0.24，并分析了基于LLM的解决方案的失败案例及其改进方向。

Conclusion: ReqEBench是一个新的CPS需求关注提取基准，旨在促进自动需求关注提取解决方案的评估和发展。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are characterized by a deep integration of the
information space and the physical world, which makes the extraction of
requirements concerns more challenging. Some automated solutions for
requirements concern extraction have been proposed to alleviate the burden on
requirements engineers. However, evaluating the effectiveness of these
solutions, which relies on fair and comprehensive benchmarks, remains an open
question. To address this gap, we propose ReqEBench, a new CPSs requirements
concern extraction benchmark, which contains 2,721 requirements from 12
real-world CPSs. ReqEBench offers four advantages. It aligns with real-world
CPSs requirements in multiple dimensions, e.g., scale and complexity. It covers
comprehensive concerns related to CPSs requirements. It undergoes a rigorous
annotation process. It covers multiple application domains of CPSs, e.g.,
aerospace and healthcare. We conducted a comparative study on three types of
automated requirements concern extraction solutions and revealed their
performance in real-world CPSs using our ReqEBench. We found that the highest
F1 score of GPT-4 is only 0.24 in entity concern extraction. We further analyze
failure cases of popular LLM-based solutions, summarize their shortcomings, and
provide ideas for improving their capabilities. We believe ReqEBench will
facilitate the evaluation and development of automated requirements concern
extraction.

Yocto repositories, a custom layer (meta-custom), and a coordinating manifest
layer to ensure version synchronization, scalability, and reproducibility.
Three sample projects, including libhelloworld, helloworld, and the kernel
module hello mod, were developed and integrated into the build process.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines were implemented
with GitLab CI and combined with an isolated Docker environment to automate and
streamline the build and testing workflows. Using a local cache server
containing hashserv, downloads and sstate cache significantly reduced the build
time. The functionality and stability of the system were verified through six
boot test scenarios in the QEMU simulator. The results show that the proposed
design not only ensures reproducibility but also can be extended to advanced
applications such as continuous deployment of real-time Linux versions. Future
recommendations include expanding automated tests, implementing system
monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, using distributed builds, optimizing
with Docker multi-stage builds, and enabling continuous deployment of real-time
Linux changes to provide a stable and scalable model for industrial and
research projects in embedded systems with a rapid and reliable development
cycle.

### [82] [Trace: Securing Smart Contract Repository Against Access Control Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19254)
*Chong Chen,Jiachi Chen,Lingfeng Bao,David Lo,Yanlin Wang,Zhenyu Shan,Ting Chen,Guangqiang Yin,Jianxing Yu,Zibin Zheng*

TL;DR: TRACE 通过补全非可编译合约并分析其调用图，显著提升了对智能合约访问控制漏洞的检测能力，性能远超现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约中的访问控制漏洞已导致数十亿美元损失，现有工具因需合约可编译而无法有效分析复杂仓库中的漏洞。

Method: TRACE 利用 LLMs 定位涉及关键操作的敏感函数，将这些函数片段补全为可编译合约，构建函数调用图，并通过控制流图分析节点信息来检测访问控制漏洞。

Result: TRACE 在开源 CVE 数据集中检测到 15 个 CVE 中的 14 个，对 5,000 个最新链上合约的精确率达 89.2%，在 83 个真实仓库中精确率为 87.0%。

Conclusion: TRACE 是一种有效检测非可编译智能合约仓库中访问控制漏洞的工具，其性能显著优于现有最先进工具。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities, particularly improper Access Control that
allows unauthorized execution of restricted functions, have caused billions of
dollars in losses. GitHub hosts numerous smart contract repositories containing
source code, documentation, and configuration files-these serve as intermediate
development artifacts that must be compiled and packaged before deployment.
Third-party developers often reference, reuse, or fork code from these
repositories during custom development. However, if the referenced code
contains vulnerabilities, it can introduce significant security risks. Existing
tools for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities are limited in their ability
to handle complex repositories, as they typically require the target contract
to be compilable to generate an abstract representation for further analysis.
This paper presents TRACE, a tool designed to secure non-compilable smart
contract repositories against access control vulnerabilities. TRACE employs
LLMs to locate sensitive functions involving critical operations (e.g.,
transfer) within the contract and subsequently completes function snippets into
a fully compilable contract. TRACE constructs a function call graph from the
abstract syntax tree (AST) of the completed contract. It uses the control flow
graph (CFG) of each function as node information. The nodes of the sensitive
functions are then analyzed to detect Access Control vulnerabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE outperforms state-of-the-art tools
on an open-sourced CVE dataset, detecting 14 out of 15 CVEs. In addition, it
achieves 89.2% precision on 5,000 recent on-chain contracts, far exceeding the
best existing tool at 76.9%. On 83 real-world repositories, TRACE achieves
87.0% precision, significantly surpassing DeepSeek-R1's 14.3%.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的代理系统，自动化生成和优化RESTful微服务的API和代码，验证了其在保持规范简洁时的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动RESTful Web服务的API优先开发自动化，并测试基于LLM的多代理系统在支持API优先开发方法中的能力。

Method: 利用基于LLM的代理系统自动生成OpenAPI规范，从中生成服务器代码，并通过分析执行日志和错误消息的反馈循环来优化代码。

Result: 使用PRAB基准测试表明，系统能够生成符合规范的功能代码。

Conclusion: 如果保持OpenAPI规范简洁且专注，LLM能够生成与规范一致的完整功能代码。

Abstract: This paper presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs)-based
agents to automate the API-first development of RESTful microservices. This
system helps to create an OpenAPI specification, generate server code from it,
and refine the code through a feedback loop that analyzes execution logs and
error messages. The integration of log analysis enables the LLM to detect and
address issues efficiently, reducing the number of iterations required to
produce functional and robust services. This study's main goal is to advance
API-first development automation for RESTful web services and test the
capability of LLM-based multi-agent systems in supporting the API-first
development approach. To test the proposed system's potential, we utilized the
PRAB benchmark. The results indicate that if we keep the OpenAPI specification
small and focused, LLMs are capable of generating complete functional code with
business logic that aligns to the specification. The code for the system is
publicly available at https://github.com/sirbh/code-gen

TL;DR: 该研究通过实验发现位运算符的可理解性存在差异，某些运算符不够直观，可能需要进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在调查编程中位运算符的可读性和可理解性，主要假设是暴露于各种位运算符相关问题的参与者和未暴露的参与者之间在性能指标（响应时间和错误率）上存在差异。

Method: 本研究采用‘被试内实验设计’来评估具有不同编程背景的人如何理解和使用位运算符。参与者完成JavaScript程序中的任务，记录任务完成时间和准确性以供分析。

Result: 结果表明，运算符可以是预测响应时间的因素之一，具有小而显著的效果（R-squared 0.032，F(1,494) = 16.5，p < .001）。此外，某些运算符如OR、NOT和左移在任务完成时间上与其他运算符相比显示出统计显著性。

Conclusion: 尽管位运算符的复杂性通常不会导致更长的任务完成时间，但某些运算符被发现不够直观，这表明需要进一步调查和潜在的重新设计以提高可理解性。

Abstract: Objectives: This study aims to investigate the readability and
understandability of bitwise operators in programming, with the main hypothesis
that there will be a difference in the performance metrics (response time and
error rate) between participants exposed to various bitwise operators related
questions and those who are not.
  Participants: Participants in this human research study include people
without programming background, novice programmers, and university students
with varying programming experience (from freshmen to PhD level). There were 23
participants for this study.
  Study Methods: This study uses an Within-Subjects Experimental Design to
assess how people with diverse programming backgrounds understand and use
bitwise operators. Participants complete tasks in JavaScript program, and their
task completion time and accuracy of the tasks are recorded for analysis.
  Findings: The results indicate that operators can be one of the factors
predicting response time, with a small but significant effect, with R-squared
0.032, (1, 494) = 16.5, p < .001. Additionally, some operators like OR, NOT,
and Left Shift showed statistical significance in task completion times
compared to other operators.
  Conclusions: While the complexity of bitwise operators did not generally
result in longer task completion times, certain operators were found to be less
intuitive, suggesting the need for further investigation and potential redesign
for improved understandability.

TL;DR: Jaralyzer是一种字节码中心Java依赖扫描工具，能有效检测修改和未修改依赖中的漏洞，优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件代码库中71%的代码来自开源软件（OSS）依赖，这种高度依赖带来了安全风险，现有依赖扫描工具在检测修改后的依赖时存在不足。

Method: Jaralyzer直接分析依赖的字节码，不依赖元数据或源代码。

Result: Jaralyzer在56个流行的OSS组件上评估，能检测所有类型的依赖修改中的漏洞，且在未修改依赖时检测到更多真实漏洞并减少误报。

Conclusion: Jaralyzer是一种针对Java的字节码中心依赖扫描工具，能够有效检测修改后的依赖中的漏洞，且在未修改依赖的情况下也优于现有工具。

Abstract: On average, 71% of the code in typical Java projects comes from open-source
software (OSS) dependencies, making OSS dependencies the dominant component of
modern software code bases. This high degree of OSS reliance comes with a
considerable security risk of adding known security vulnerabilities to a code
base. To remedy this risk, researchers and companies have developed various
dependency scanners, which try to identify inclusions of known-to-be-vulnerable
OSS dependencies. However, there are still challenges that modern dependency
scanners do not overcome, especially when it comes to dependency modifications,
such as re-compilations, re-bundlings or re-packagings, which are common in the
Java ecosystem. To overcome these challenges, we present Jaralyzer, a
bytecode-centric dependency scanner for Java. Jaralyzer does not rely on the
metadata or the source code of the included OSS dependencies being available
but directly analyzes a dependency's bytecode. Our evaluation across 56 popular
OSS components demonstrates that Jaralyzer outperforms other popular dependency
scanners in detecting vulnerabilities within modified dependencies. It is the
only scanner capable of identifying vulnerabilities across all the above
mentioned types of modifications. But even when applied to unmodified
dependencies, Jaralyzer outperforms the current state-of-the-art code-centric
scanner Eclipse Steady by detecting 28 more true vulnerabilities and yielding
29 fewer false warnings.

TL;DR: AutoMT利用LLM自动化提取变形关系并生成测试用例，显著提升测试多样性和违规检测率，优于传统手动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的变形测试方法在自动驾驶系统中依赖大量手动工作且缺乏自动化，AutoMT旨在解决这一问题，通过自动化提取变形关系和生成测试用例来提高测试效率和效果。

Method: AutoMT是一个基于大型语言模型的多代理变形测试框架，利用预定义本体从本地交通规则中提取变形关系，并通过视觉语言代理分析场景，搜索代理从RAG数据库中检索合适的变形关系以生成后续测试用例。

Result: 实验表明，AutoMT在后续测试用例生成中实现了高达5倍的测试多样性提升，并检测到20.55%更多的行为违规，优于手动专家定义的变形关系。

Conclusion: AutoMT通过自动化提取多样化的变形关系，显著提升了测试多样性和行为违规检测率，其模块化架构支持工业流程集成，有望系统性地覆盖未被充分代表或安全关键场景。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) are safety-critical, where failures can be
severe. While Metamorphic Testing (MT) is effective for fault detection in ADS,
existing methods rely heavily on manual effort and lack automation. We present
AutoMT, a multi-agent MT framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that
automates the extraction of Metamorphic Relations (MRs) from local traffic
rules and the generation of valid follow-up test cases. AutoMT leverages LLMs
to extract MRs from traffic rules in Gherkin syntax using a predefined
ontology. A vision-language agent analyzes scenarios, and a search agent
retrieves suitable MRs from a RAG-based database to generate follow-up cases
via computer vision. Experiments show that AutoMT achieves up to 5 x higher
test diversity in follow-up case generation compared to the best baseline
(manual expert-defined MRs) in terms of validation rate, and detects up to
20.55% more behavioral violations. While manual MT relies on a fixed set of
predefined rules, AutoMT automatically extracts diverse metamorphic relations
that augment real-world datasets and help uncover corner cases often missed
during in-field testing and data collection. Its modular architecture
separating MR extraction, filtering, and test generation supports integration
into industrial pipelines and potentially enables simulation-based testing to
systematically cover underrepresented or safety-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究通过分析欧洲30个互操作性测试设施，提出了未来测试环境开发的蓝图，为建立协调的欧洲互操作性测试生态系统做出了贡献。

Abstract: The ongoing transformation of the European energy landscape, driven by the
integration of renewable energy sources, digital technologies, and
decentralized systems, requires a high degree of interoperability across
diverse components and systems. Ensuring that these elements can exchange
information and operate together reliably is essential for achieving a secure,
flexible, and efficient energy supply infrastructure. While several initiatives
have contributed to the development of smart grid testing infrastructures, they
do not provide a dedicated or comprehensive focus on interoperability testing.
A structured and harmonized overview of interoperability testing capabilities
across Europe is therefore still missing. This work therefore presents a novel
contribution by analyzing the European interoperability testing facility
landscape through a structured survey of 30 facilities. It provides a
categorized inventory of testing infrastructures, applied methodologies, and
reference test cases, and introduces a blueprint for the development of future
testing environments. The findings contribute to the establishment of a
coordinated European ecosystem for interoperability testing, supporting
collaboration, innovation, and alignment with the goals of the energy
transition.

Motivation: 现有的RCA调查通常按输入数据类型分类，忽视了目标差异，导致研究进展和差距被掩盖。本文旨在填补这一空白，为读者提供更清晰的领域概览。

Method: 提出了一个目标驱动的框架，对2014年至2025年间135篇关于云事件管理中RCA的论文进行了分类和整合。

Result: 成功构建了一个目标驱动的分类框架，涵盖135篇论文，并识别了RCA研究的终极目标和未来挑战。

Conclusion: 本文通过目标驱动的框架对云事件管理中的根因分析（RCA）研究进行了系统分类，并讨论了不同RCA表述的终极目标，同时提出了该领域的开放挑战和未来方向。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a crucial aspect of incident management in
large-scale cloud services. While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been
widely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because
the term "RCA" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For
instance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is
fundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a
definitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these
goal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types
(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of
works with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps
in the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen
who want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who
want to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA
survey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high
demand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that
effectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of
cloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period
from 2014 to 2025. In addition to the goal-driven categorization, it discusses
the ultimate goal of all RCA papers as an umbrella covering different RCA
formulations. Moreover, the paper discusses open challenges and future
directions in RCA.

Conclusion: AutoPage成功地将论文转化为高质量、视觉吸引力的网页，且在15分钟内以低于0.1美元的成本完成，展示了其高效性和经济性。

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as
the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual,
repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers
accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the
dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge.
To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not
in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce
$\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy.
AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline
from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive
rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each
step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the
final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the
system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously
validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first
benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates
high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency
in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at
$\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

Motivation: 现有方法在提升反编译代码的准确性和可读性方面存在不足，尤其是在处理复杂闭源二进制文件时，缺乏有效的检测和纠正机制。

Method: FidelityGPT结合了检索增强生成（RAG）和动态语义强度算法，通过定制的失真感知提示模板和变量依赖算法，系统性地检测和纠正语义失真。

Result: 在620个函数对的评估中，FidelityGPT的平均检测准确率为89%，精确率为83%，显著优于现有方法DeGPT（Fix Rate 83%，Corrected Fix Rate 37%）。

Conclusion: FidelityGPT在提升反编译代码的准确性和可读性方面表现出色，特别是在处理复杂闭源二进制文件时，其检测和纠正语义失真的能力显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Decompilation converts machine code into human-readable form, enabling
analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often
degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing
methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide
partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for
complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that
enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting
and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware
prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity
algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from
a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context
limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies
into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary
similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89%
and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%,
Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating
significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its
potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.

Abstract: Agentic AI is poised to usher in a seismic paradigm shift in Software
Engineering (SE). As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a
reality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area.
While early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related
activities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a range of
socio-technical concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to
the emerging community vision by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope
beyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations
and evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary
set of values and principles to guide efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on
designing/using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE. It is hoped that these
ideas will encourage community collaborations and steer the SE community
towards laying strong foundations of agentic SE so its not only inevitable but
also deliberate and desirable in the long run.

Motivation: 调查大型语言模型（LLMs）如何通过零代码开发平台改变软件创建，使非程序员能够构建应用程序。

Method: 采用广泛的调查方法，根据关键维度（如界面风格、后端集成、输出类型和可扩展性）对平台进行分类，并分析专用LLM应用构建器和集成LLM功能的通用无代码平台。

Result: 提出了一种分类法，按界面、支持的LLM后端、输出类型和扩展性对这些平台进行分类，并详细比较了各平台的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 尽管基于零代码的大型语言模型平台显著降低了创建AI驱动应用的门槛，但在灵活性和可靠性方面仍面临挑战。总体而言，这一领域正在迅速发展，为非程序员提供了创建复杂软件的激动人心的机会。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software creation by enabling
zero code development platforms. Our survey reviews recent platforms that let
users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains
of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing
platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration,
output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app
builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and
general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM
capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their
interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type
(chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core
features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration,
and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed
comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs
(customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with
traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future
directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved
orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate
that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI
powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and
reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting
opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.

TL;DR: BOSQTGEN 是一种黑盒 API 测试生成工具，通过分解 API 规范并利用 LLMs 和组合测试，显著提高了测试覆盖率，接近手工测试套件的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件越来越多地通过组合 API 构建，但不足的 API 契约会导致期望不匹配和故障，因此迫切需要稳健的一致性测试。当前测试生成技术面临多语言系统、源代码不可访问性、成本-可靠性权衡以及生成结构化输入的困难等挑战。

Method: BOSQTGEN 采用了一种新颖的方法，将 API 规范分解为原语，利用 LLMs 建议一致的层次结构，并通过组合测试对这些值进行高效采样。

Result: BOSQTGEN 系统在 RESTful 基准测试中平均实现了 82% 的代码覆盖率，通常比现有最先进系统提高了 20% 或更多，接近手工编写的测试套件。

Conclusion: BOSQTGEN 提供了一种完全基于 API 的测试生成方法，使开发者能够自动创建高质量的测试用例，用于验证或测试驱动开发。

Abstract: Modern software is increasingly built by composing APIs, elevating the API
contract to a critical role. Inadequate contracts, however, lead to mismatched
expectations and failures, creating a pressing need for robust conformance
testing. Current test generation techniques are hindered by key challenges:
polyglot systems, source code inaccessibility, a cost-reliability trade-off,
and, most critically, the difficulty of generating structured inputs.
  We introduce BOSQTGEN, a novel black-box methodology and tool for API test
generation. BOSQTGEN utilizes a novel approach for decomposing API
specifications into primitives, using LLMs to suggest coherent strata for them,
and employing combinatorial testing to efficiently sample over these values.
This approach ensures coverage of critical interactions while avoiding the
redundancy of random sampling.
  The resulting BOSQTGEN system achieves an average of 82% code coverage on
RESTful benchmarks, often a 20% or more increase over prior state-of-the-art
systems and nearing parity with hand-written test suites. Providing a fully
API-driven approach to test generation, enables developers to automatically
create high-quality test cases for validation or test-driven development.

Motivation: 解决多智能体LLM系统因高成本协调而无法实现并行加速的问题。

Method: 使用Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)实现观察驱动的协调模式，避免显式消息传递。

Result: 在600次试验中（6个任务，每种模式50次运行），某些任务速度提升高达21.1%，其他任务速度下降高达39.4%，但100%收敛且零合并失败。

Conclusion: CodeCRDT通过观察驱动的协调模式，实现了无锁、无冲突的并发代码生成，具有强最终一致性。虽然在不同任务上表现出速度提升或下降，但100%的收敛性和零合并失败证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems fail to realize parallel speedups due to costly
coordination. We present CodeCRDT, an observation-driven coordination pattern
where agents coordinate by monitoring a shared state with observable updates
and deterministic convergence, rather than explicit message passing. Using
Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), CodeCRDT enables lock-free,
conflict-free concurrent code generation with strong eventual consistency.
Evaluation across 600 trials (6 tasks, 50 runs per mode) shows both benefits
and trade-offs: up to 21.1% speedup on some tasks, up to 39.4% slowdown on
others, and 100% convergence with zero merge failures. The study formalizes
observation-driven coordination for stochastic LLM agents, revealing semantic
conflict rates (5-10%) and quality-performance tradeoffs, and provides
empirical characterization of when parallel coordination succeeds versus fails
based on task structure.

Motivation: 探索AI驱动的分布式系统策略设计，以提升设计空间的搜索效率并保持可解释性。

Method: 结合大型语言模型（LLMs）的随机代码生成与特定领域模拟器中的确定性验证，通过迭代生成-验证循环设计调度策略。

Result: 初步结果显示在多模型上实现了吞吐量提升，并讨论了当前设置的局限性。

Conclusion: 本文认为AI在扩展该方法论方面至关重要，特别是在帮助引导新模拟器的开发上。

Abstract: We explore AI-driven distributed-systems policy design by combining
stochastic code generation from large language models (LLMs) with deterministic
verification in a domain-specific simulator. Using a Function-as-a-Service
runtime (Bauplan) and its open-source simulator (Eudoxia) as a case study, we
frame scheduler design as an iterative generate-and-verify loop: an LLM
proposes a Python policy, the simulator evaluates it on standardized traces,
and structured feedback steers subsequent generations. This setup preserves
interpretability while enabling targeted search over a large design space. We
detail the system architecture and report preliminary results on throughput
improvements across multiple models. Beyond early gains, we discuss the limits
of the current setup and outline next steps; in particular, we conjecture that
AI will be crucial for scaling this methodology by helping to bootstrap new
simulators.

TL;DR: RailS是一种分布式负载均衡框架，通过局部调度和多路径传输优化MoE训练中的通信效率，显著提升带宽利用率和减少完成时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负载均衡方法无法充分利用Rail架构的确定性拓扑结构，导致多NIC带宽利用率不足，影响MoE训练效率。

Method: RailS采用基于Rail拓扑对称性的局部调度策略，利用Longest Processing Time First (LPT)喷洒调度器和多路径传输技术。

Result: RailS在合成和实际MoE工作负载中，总线带宽提升20%--78%，完成时间减少17%--78%，Mixtral工作负载的迭代时间缩短18%--40%。

Conclusion: RailS通过利用Rail拓扑的对称性和局部调度策略，显著提高了MoE训练中的通信效率和负载均衡，实现了近乎最优的性能。

Abstract: Training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models introduces sparse and highly
imbalanced all-to-all communication that dominates iteration time. Conventional
load-balancing methods fail to exploit the deterministic topology of Rail
architectures, leaving multi-NIC bandwidth underutilized. We present RailS, a
distributed load-balancing framework that minimizes all-to-all completion time
in MoE training. RailS leverages the Rail topology's symmetry to prove that
uniform sending ensures uniform receiving, transforming global coordination
into local scheduling. Each node independently executes a Longest Processing
Time First (LPT) spraying scheduler to proactively balance traffic using local
information. RailS activates N parallel rails for fine-grained, topology-aware
multipath transmission. Across synthetic and real-world MoE workloads, RailS
improves bus bandwidth by 20%--78% and reduces completion time by 17%--78%. For
Mixtral workloads, it shortens iteration time by 18%--40% and achieves
near-optimal load balance, fully exploiting architectural parallelism in
distributed training.

TL;DR: 比较Java、Python和Scala在Apache Spark上处理数据的效率，发现Python适合小数据，Scala和Java适合大数据和复杂操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究关注单个阶段，但使用Apache Iceberg对完整ETL工作流在编程语言间的全面比较仍有限。

Method: 通过执行包括从CSV文件下载数据、转换并加载到Apache Iceberg分析表中的多项操作，比较了Java、Python和Scala在Apache Spark平台上的表现。

Result: 处理5MB CSV文件时，Python最快（6.71秒），Scala和Java分别为9.13秒和9.62秒；处理1.6GB文件时，Python仍最快（46.34秒），Scala和Java分别为47.72秒和50.56秒；在复杂操作（合并两个CSV文件）中，Scala最快（374.42秒），Java为379.8秒，Python最慢（398.32秒）。

Conclusion: 编程语言显著影响Apache Spark算法的数据处理效率，Scala和Java在处理大数据量和复杂操作时表现更优，而Python在小数据量处理中具有优势。这些结果可根据具体性能需求和数据量优化数据处理流程。

Abstract: During the study, the results of a comparative analysis of the process of
handling large datasets using the Apache Spark platform in Java, Python, and
Scala programming languages were obtained. Although prior works have focused on
individual stages, comprehensive comparisons of full ETL workflows across
programming languages using Apache Iceberg remain limited. The analysis was
performed by executing several operations, including downloading data from CSV
files, transforming and loading it into an Apache Iceberg analytical table. It
was found that the performance of the Spark algorithm varies significantly
depending on the amount of data and the programming language used. When
processing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71
seconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of
9.62 seconds. For processing a large CSV file of 1.6 gigabytes, all programming
languages demonstrated similar results: the fastest performance was showed in
Python: 46.34 seconds, while Scala and Java showed results of 47.72 and 50.56
seconds, respectively. When performing a more complex operation that involved
combining two CSV files into a single dataset for further loading into an
Apache Iceberg table, Scala demonstrated the highest performance, at 374.42
seconds. Java processing was completed in 379.8 seconds, while Python was the
least efficient, with a runtime of 398.32 seconds. It follows that the
programming language significantly affects the efficiency of data processing by
the Apache Spark algorithm, with Scala and Java being more productive for
processing large amounts of data and complex operations, while Python
demonstrates an advantage in working with small amounts of data. The results
obtained can be useful for optimizing data handling processes depending on
specific performance requirements and the amount of information being
processed.

*Jingfan Meng,Tianji Yang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的集合交集协议（SetX），通过压缩感知和多轮通信显著降低通信成本，比传统SetR协议节省8至10倍开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案通常复用集合对账协议（SetR），但由于SetX与SetR的成本差异被低估，缺乏专用SetX协议。本研究旨在开发一种更高效的SetX协议。

Method: 采用多轮通信协议和压缩感知（CS）技术，Alice和Bob通过交换压缩后的集合信息逐步识别并更新各自的唯一元素，最终达成集合交集。

Result: 实验表明，该SetX协议在真实数据集上将通信成本降低了8至10倍，优于基于IBLT的SetR协议。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种高效的集合交集协议（SetX），通过压缩感知技术和多轮通信显著降低了通信成本，相比传统的集合对账协议（SetR）节省了8至10倍的通信开销。

Abstract: In the set reconciliation (\textsf{SetR}) problem, two parties Alice and Bob,
holding sets $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$, communicate to learn the symmetric
difference $\mathsf{A} \Delta \mathsf{B}$. In this work, we study a related but
under-explored problem: set intersection (\textsf{SetX})~\cite{Ozisik2019},
where both parties learn $\mathsf{A} \cap \mathsf{B}$ instead. However,
existing solutions typically reuse \textsf{SetR} protocols due to the absence
of dedicated \textsf{SetX} protocols and the misconception that \textsf{SetR}
and \textsf{SetX} have comparable costs. Observing that \textsf{SetX} is
fundamentally cheaper than \textsf{SetR}, we developed a multi-round
\textsf{SetX} protocol that outperforms the information-theoretic lower bound
of \textsf{SetR} problem. In our \textsf{SetX} protocol, Alice sends Bob a
compressed sensing (CS) sketch of $\mathsf{A}$ to help Bob identify his unique
elements (those in $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$). This solves the \textsf{SetX}
problem, if $\mathsf{A} \subseteq \mathsf{B}$. Otherwise, Bob sends a CS sketch
of the residue (a set of elements he cannot decode) back to Alice for her to
decode her unique elements (those in $\mathsf{A \setminus B}$). As such, Alice
and Bob communicate back and forth %with a set membership filter (SMF) of
estimated $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$. Alice updates $\mathsf{A}$ and
communication repeats until both parties agrees on $\mathsf{A} \cap
\mathsf{B}$. On real world datasets, experiments show that our $\mathsf{SetX}$
protocol reduces the communication cost by 8 to 10 times compared to the
IBLT-based $\mathsf{SetR}$ protocol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布式对称打破问题中的局部性，特别是在正则图中的匹配问题，以建立对称打破问题的下界和分类结果。

Method: 本文采用了随机化算法，并基于Luby算法的改进，结合新颖的基于鞅的分析方法。

Result: 对于近似匹配，局部性仅依赖于ε；对于最大匹配，节点平均复杂度为O(1)，与最坏情况复杂度形成强烈对比。

Conclusion: 本文通过研究正则图中的匹配问题，展示了近似匹配问题的局部性仅依赖于ε，而与图的其他参数无关。此外，对于最大匹配，本文揭示了节点平均复杂度与最坏情况复杂度之间的显著差异。

Abstract: The main goal in distributed symmetry-breaking is to understand the locality
of problems; i.e., the radius of the neighborhood that a node needs to explore
in order to arrive at its part of a global solution. In this work, we study the
locality of matching problems in the family of regular graphs, which is one of
the main benchmarks for establishing lower bounds on the locality of
symmetry-breaking problems, as well as for obtaining classification results.
For approximate matching, we develop randomized algorithms to show that $(1 +
\epsilon)$-approximate matching in regular graphs is truly local; i.e., the
locality depends only on $\epsilon$ and is independent of all other graph
parameters. Furthermore, as long as the degree $\Delta$ is not very small
(namely, as long as $\Delta \geq \text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$), this dependence is
only logarithmic in $1/\epsilon$. This stands in sharp contrast to maximal
matching in regular graphs which requires some dependence on the number of
nodes $n$ or the degree $\Delta$. We show matching lower bounds for both
results. For maximal matching, our techniques further allow us to establish a
strong separation between the node-averaged complexity and worst-case
complexity of maximal matching in regular graphs, by showing that the former is
only $O(1)$. Central to our main technical contribution is a novel
martingale-based analysis for the $\approx 40$-year-old algorithm by Luby. In
particular, our analysis shows that applying one round of Luby's algorithm on
the line graph of a $\Delta$-regular graph results in an almost
$\Delta/2$-regular graph.

TL;DR: RLBoost是一种利用可抢占GPU资源提升RL训练效率和成本的混合架构解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL框架在资源利用上存在不足，无法充分利用可抢占GPU资源，RLBoost旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RLBoost采用混合架构，结合三种关键技术：自适应rollout卸载、基于pull的权重传输和令牌级响应收集与迁移。

Result: 实验表明，RLBoost将训练吞吐量提高了1.51倍至1.97倍，成本效率提升了28%至49%。

Conclusion: RLBoost通过有效利用可抢占GPU资源，显著提升了RL训练的成本效率和吞吐量，实验证明其比仅使用按需GPU资源更高效。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become essential for unlocking advanced
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). RL workflows involve
interleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource
requirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales
efficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training
requires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL
frameworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated
architectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing
both stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without
modifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource
under-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances
on public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant
cost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently
harvested for rollout.
  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient
RL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that
rollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with
preemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these
resources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost
adopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout
offload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster,
(2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available
instances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient
preemption handling and continuous load balancing. Extensive experiments show
RLBoost increases training throughput by 1.51x-1.97x while improving cost
efficiency by 28%-49% compared to using only on-demand GPU resources.

TL;DR: FLASH Viterbi是一种快速、轻量、自适应且硬件友好的Viterbi解码算子，通过分治、剪枝和并行化提升效率，适合边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工作负载向资源受限的边缘平台迁移，传统Viterbi解码因内存密集和计算不灵活而面临挑战。现有方法在时间与空间效率上存在权衡且缺乏适应性。

Method: FLASH Viterbi采用非递归分治策略、剪枝和并行化技术；FLASH-BS Viterbi则基于动态束搜索和内存高效数据结构。两种算法均支持动态参数调整以适应不同场景。

Result: 实验表明，FLASH Viterbi和FLASH-BS Viterbi在解码时间和内存效率上均优于现有基线，同时保持适应性和硬件友好特性。

Conclusion: FLASH Viterbi及其变体FLASH-BS Viterbi通过结合非递归分治策略、剪枝和并行化技术，显著提升了时间和内存效率，适合资源受限的数据系统。此外，FPGA硬件加速器进一步确保了高效部署。

Abstract: The Viterbi algorithm is a key operator for structured sequence inference in
modern data systems, with applications in trajectory analysis, online
recommendation, and speech recognition. As these workloads increasingly migrate
to resource-constrained edge platforms, standard Viterbi decoding remains
memory-intensive and computationally inflexible. Existing methods typically
trade decoding time for space efficiency, but often incur significant runtime
overhead and lack adaptability to various system constraints. This paper
presents FLASH Viterbi, a Fast, Lightweight, Adaptive, and Hardware-Friendly
Viterbi decoding operator that enhances adaptability and resource efficiency.
FLASH Viterbi combines a non-recursive divide-and-conquer strategy with pruning
and parallelization techniques to enhance both time and memory efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained data systems.To further decouple
space complexity from the hidden state space size, we present FLASH-BS Viterbi,
a dynamic beam search variant built on a memory-efficient data structure. Both
proposed algorithms exhibit strong adaptivity to diverse deployment scenarios
by dynamically tuning internal parameters.To ensure practical deployment on
edge devices, we also develop FPGA-based hardware accelerators for both
algorithms, demonstrating high throughput and low resource usage. Extensive
experiments show that our algorithms consistently outperform existing baselines
in both decoding time and memory efficiency, while preserving adaptability and
hardware-friendly characteristics essential for modern data systems. All codes

TL;DR: HybridEP 通过动态调整专家布局和优化通信拓扑，显著提升了跨数据中心 MoE 模型的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着 MoE 模型的规模不断扩大，跨数据中心的专家并行（EP）面临带宽限制的挑战，现有优化方法在低带宽场景下效果有限。

Method: HybridEP 结合了流式模型来确定最佳传输比例，并采用了基于域的分区和参数高效迁移技术，以优化通信拓扑结构。

Result: 实验结果表明，HybridEP 在受限带宽下比现有 MoE 训练系统快 5.6 倍，在 1k 数据中心的模拟中实现了 1.45 倍的加速。

Conclusion: HybridEP 提出了一种在有限带宽下优化专家并行（EP）的框架，通过动态调整专家的空间布局来减少数据通信量和频率，显著提升了 MoE 模型在跨数据中心训练中的扩展性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a popular architecture for scaling large
models. However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single
DC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under
this, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due
to the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations
attempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit
in low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.
Therefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical
roadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.
  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize
EP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the
spatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and
frequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is
non-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original
communication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore
build a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided
by this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct
the mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU
level, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by
reducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining
all these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better
scalability. Experimental results show that HybridEP outperforms existing
state-of-the-art MoE training systems by up to 5.6x under constrained
bandwidth. We further compare HybridEP and EP on large-scale simulations.
HybridEP achieves up to 1.45x speedup with 1k DCs under different bandwidths.

Motivation: 随着协作式机器学习规模的扩大，现有特定用途的服务器-客户端系统在可扩展性和复用性上存在不足，亟需一种高效、可扩展且支持多租户的资源管理系统。

Method: Propius系统由控制平面和数据平面组成，控制平面实现多任务间的资源共享，数据平面提升模型共享和结果收集的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Propius系统在资源利用率、吞吐量和任务完成时间方面均优于现有资源管理技术，证明了其在协作式机器学习中的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Collaborative Machine Learning is a paradigm in the field of distributed
machine learning, designed to address the challenges of data privacy,
communication overhead, and model heterogeneity. There have been significant
advancements in optimization and communication algorithm design and ML hardware
that enables fair, efficient and secure collaborative ML training. However,
less emphasis is put on collaborative ML infrastructure development. Developers
and researchers often build server-client systems for a specific collaborative
ML use case, which is not scalable and reusable. As the scale of collaborative
ML grows, the need for a scalable, efficient, and ideally multi-tenant resource
management system becomes more pressing. We propose a novel system, Propius,
that can adapt to the heterogeneity of client machines, and efficiently manage
and control the computation flow between ML jobs and edge resources in a
scalable fashion. Propius is comprised of a control plane and a data plane. The
control plane enables efficient resource sharing among multiple collaborative
ML jobs and supports various resource sharing policies, while the data plane
improves the scalability of collaborative ML model sharing and result
collection. Evaluations show that Propius outperforms existing resource
management techniques and frameworks in terms of resource utilization (up to
$1.88\times$), throughput (up to $2.76$), and job completion time (up to
$1.26\times$).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业与政府组织越来越依赖数据驱动的分析，但分布式框架（如Spark和Flink）在中等规模、延迟敏感的推理中存在协调复杂性和审计开销问题。云提供商提供的无服务器GPU和TabNet等模型为受监管环境提供了新的部署方案。

Method: 研究提出了一种集成单节点无服务器GPU运行时与TabNet的BDaaS蓝图，利用GPU加速提高吞吐量，无服务器弹性降低成本，以及特征掩码可解释性实现合规性。

Result: 实验结果表明，GPU流水线相比Spark基线实现了高达4.5倍的吞吐量提升、98倍的延迟降低和90%的每千次推理成本降低，合规机制仅增加约5.7毫秒延迟。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一种面向生产的大数据即服务（BDaaS）蓝图，结合了单节点无服务器GPU运行时和TabNet，为受监管的企业和政府环境提供了安全、可解释且成本效益高的分析解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven
analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where
timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed
frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or
streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing
overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference.
Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet
enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for
regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big
Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless
GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput,
serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for
IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets,
comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that
GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90%
lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance
mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains
stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these
findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged
blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of
secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for
regulated enterprise and government settings.

addressed this timely gap by benchmarking Redis alternatives and systematically
evaluating Valkey, KeyDB, and Garnet under realistic workloads within

benchmarked data systems. Our study presents a comprehensive performance and
viability assessment of the emerging in-memory key-value stores. Metrics
include throughput, tail latency, CPU and memory efficiency, and migration

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据中心内存分层未充分发挥潜力，主要因热冷对象混杂（hotness fragmentation）导致页面级回收系统无法有效区分真正热页面与含冷对象的页面。

Method: HADES采用编译器-运行时系统（compiler-runtime system）跟踪和迁移基于访问模式的对象，最小化开发者干预。

Result: 在十种数据结构上的评估显示，内存使用减少高达70%，性能开销仅为3%。

Conclusion: 通过地址空间工程（address-space engineering）动态重组应用虚拟地址空间，HADES成功实现了内存效率的显著提升，减少了70%的内存使用，同时仅带来3%的性能开销。

Abstract: Memory tiering in datacenters does not achieve its full potential due to
hotness fragmentation -- the intermingling of hot and cold objects within
memory pages. This fragmentation prevents page-based reclamation systems from
distinguishing truly hot pages from pages containing mostly cold objects,
fundamentally limiting memory efficiency despite highly skewed accesses. We
introduce address-space engineering: dynamically reorganizing application
virtual address spaces to create uniformly hot and cold regions that any
page-level tiering backend can manage effectively. HADES demonstrates this
frontend/backend approach through a compiler-runtime system that tracks and
migrates objects based on access patterns, requiring minimal developer
intervention. Evaluations across ten data structures achieve up to 70% memory
reduction with 3% performance overhead, showing that address space engineering
enables existing reclamation systems to reclaim memory aggressively without
performance degradation.

Motivation: 月球极地永久阴影区（PSRs）的复杂地形对机器人探索提出挑战，需要一种能够量化地形与机器人物理交互的地图构建方法。

Method: 利用四足机器人的本体感知数据（如足部滑动、能量消耗和稳定性裕度），构建多层次的2.5D网格地图。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种适用于四足机器人的地形映射框架，能够在月球极端环境下有效工作，并通过模拟验证了其性能。

Abstract: Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles are of interest for
future exploration due to their potential to contain water ice and preserve
geological records. Their complex, uneven terrain favors the use of legged
robots, which can traverse challenging surfaces while collecting in-situ data,
and have proven effective in Earth analogs, including dark caves, when equipped
with onboard lighting. While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can
capture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify
its physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by
proprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped

Abstract: In the past decade, the adoption of compact 3D range sensors, such as LiDARs,
has driven the developments of robust state-estimation pipelines, making them a
standard sensor for aerial, ground, and space autonomy. Unfortunately, poor
propagation of electromagnetic waves underwater, has limited the
visibility-independent sensing options of underwater state-estimation to
acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best,
spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising
from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that
purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics
between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response
in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and
SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other
geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our
assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent
spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in
datasets expanding to hundreds of meters. At the same time it highlights
remaining challenges related to acoustic propagation, as found also in other
acoustic sensors. Datasets collected for our evaluations would be released and
shared with the community to enable further research advancements.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in 3D is a fundamental problem for autonomy. Despite
major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range
sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for
underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D
sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called
SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D
Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater
autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline
exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite
of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the
novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance,
SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from
non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to
application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with
real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and
local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed
approach in full are planned in the very near future.

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing
a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种针对4轮独立转向（4WIS）驱动系统的运动规划和控制方法，通过数学建模和运动规划器设计，有效处理了转向约束和速度空间不连续性，实现了平滑高效的机器人运动。

Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel
drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints
prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The
configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities
that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical
formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that
partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We
further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance
that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition
smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation
from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing
by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement
the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and
evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.

Conclusion: 该算法通过将非凸问题转化为凸半定规划，成功实现了航天器碰撞避免的最优机动设计，显著降低了碰撞风险。

Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance
remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated
forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of
satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for
efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an
algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term
conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a
convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate
empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of
globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation
produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of
collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability
of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty,
yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a
high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a
simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing collision risk.

Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by
the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control
strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which
impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this
study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model
Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist
integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is
formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending
deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from
deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online
adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean
square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s.
Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE
of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and
settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the
controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic
systems, thereby advancing the integration of adaptive intelligent control in
wearable assistive devices.

reasons about a set of hybrid control modes as an integer-based optimization
problem where we select what mode to apply, when to switch to another mode, and
the duration for which we are in a given control mode. A sample-based variation
is derived to efficiently search the integer domain for optimal solutions. We
find our formulation yields strong performance guarantees that can be applied
to a number of robotics-related tasks. In addition, our approach is able to
synthesize complex algorithms and policies to compound behaviors and achieve
challenging tasks. Last, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
real-world robotic examples that require reactive switching between long-term
planning and high-frequency control.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics and autonomous systems have broadened the use of
robots in laboratory settings, including automated synthesis, scalable reaction

paper presents a comprehensive development of a mobile manipulator designed to
assist human operators in such autonomous lab environments. Kinematic modeling
of the manipulator is carried out based on the Denavit Hartenberg (DH)

the manipulator ability to reliably grasp textured objects as a critical
component of autonomous handling tasks. Advanced vision-based algorithms are
implemented to perform real-time object detection and pose estimation, guiding
the manipulator in dynamic grasping and following tasks. In this work, we
integrate a vision method that combines feature-based detection with
homography-driven pose estimation, leveraging depth information to represent an
object pose as a $2$D planar projection within $3$D space. This adaptive
capability enables the system to accommodate variations in object orientation
and supports robust autonomous manipulation across diverse environments. By
enabling autonomous experimentation and human-robot collaboration, this work

Abstract: Legged robots can sense terrain through force interactions during locomotion,

as scouts for guiding wheeled rovers in challenging environments. However, even
legged scouts face challenges when traversing highly deformable or unstable

regression for traversability assessment, with a reactive controller for
real-time safe exploration and navigation. SAEGT demonstrated its ability to
safely explore and navigate toward a specified goal using only proprioceptively

Abstract: Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments
needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and
hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive
parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize
effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning
framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic
manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable
and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a
diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories
conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal
configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism
that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with
classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating
environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the
denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments
and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that
GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in
spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance
further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong
performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines.
Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3
(6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates
its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world
settings.

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

Conclusion: 本文提出的分层框架在长视距DLO路由任务中表现出色，总体成功率高达92.5%，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Long-horizon routing tasks of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as
cables and ropes, are common in industrial assembly lines and everyday life.
These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to
manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution.
Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear
dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans
composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning
during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical
framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or
explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages
vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize
feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via
reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further
introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into
insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving
object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands.
It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an
overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

Abstract: Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility,
and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human
intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a
structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to
bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their
initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe
protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute
them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation
skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we
introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a
domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations
needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations
and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according
to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as
a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable
primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and
supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These
contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous
laboratory automation. More information is available at

Abstract: The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the
development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the
problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have
proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of
these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion
models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step
shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To
balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step
consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss
into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference.
Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss
and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation
method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world
environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的概率框架显著提高了非结构化越野环境中机器人运动预测的不确定性估计和轨迹预测准确性。

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware robot motion prediction is crucial for downstream
traversability estimation and safe autonomous navigation in unstructured,
off-road environments, where terrain is heterogeneous and perceptual
uncertainty is high. Most existing methods assume deterministic or spatially
independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring the inherent local correlations of
3D spatial data and often producing unreliable predictions. In this work, we
introduce an efficient probabilistic framework that explicitly models spatially
correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters as a probabilistic
world model and propagates this uncertainty through a differentiable physics
engine for probabilistic trajectory forecasting. By leveraging structured
convolutional operators, our approach provides high-resolution multivariate
predictions at manageable computational cost. Experimental evaluation on a
publicly available dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation
and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种简单采样策略，解决机器人任务数据集动作序列不平衡问题，提升低资源任务泛化能力，不影响高资源任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人任务数据集中存在动作序列不平衡的问题，相似的物理动作序列（如“拿起苹果”和“拿起橙子”）导致数据集不平衡，影响了模型训练效果。

Method: 提出了一种简单的采样策略，只需少量代码即可集成到现有代码库中，用于策略训练。

Result: 在预训练小模型和微调大型基础模型的实验中，该方法在低资源任务上表现显著优于现有方法，且在高资源任务上未出现性能下降。真实世界实验（Franka Panda机械臂）也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的简单采样策略有效缓解了机器人任务数据集中动作序列不平衡的问题，提升了模型在低资源任务上的泛化能力，同时不影响高资源任务的性能。

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于海洋探索的需求增长，需要在狭小和苛刻环境中进行检查和干预。Eely的灵活形状和可变身体配置使其成为此类环境的理想选择，但操作中需应对不确定和非结构化环境、极端条件及受限导航能力。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法来评估风险，并通过敏感性分析展示影响最大的因素。

Result: 敏感性分析结果展示了导致失去Eely的最主要影响因素。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种贝叶斯方法来评估在两种任务场景中失去Eely的风险，旨在提高Eely的性能和任务成功的可能性。

Abstract: The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and
intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in
addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated
underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation
of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as
it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme
environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper
proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two
mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and
the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented
in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.

Conclusion: GigaBrain-0通过利用世界模型生成多样化数据，显著减少了对真实机器人数据的依赖，并提升了跨任务泛化能力。同时，RGBD输入建模和具身链式思维监督进一步增强了策略的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

Abstract: Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform
complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by
its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to
the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In
contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,
partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer
broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation
learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these
challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement
learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the
performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline
RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under
the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,
simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,
without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening
the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented
by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery
and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations
significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies
are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that
these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or
suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This
underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data
for robust policy learning in robotics.

Abstract: The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is
essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we
present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to
regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a
tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a
crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic
hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise
movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This
advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and
adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the
intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using
Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and
experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing
wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique
significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more
natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and

Motivation: 解决现有方法在零-shot视觉与语言导航中的关键权衡问题，即要么依赖环境特定的路径点预测器限制场景泛化能力，要么未能充分利用大模型的推理能力。

Method: LaViRA采用粗到细的层次结构分解动作：语言动作用于高级规划，视觉动作用于感知接地，机器人动作用于稳健导航。

Result: LaViRA在VLN-CE基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，展示了在未见环境中的卓越泛化能力。

Conclusion: LaViRA框架通过分解动作的层次结构，显著提升了在未见环境中的导航性能，同时保持了透明性和效率，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE)
requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language
instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical
trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit
scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large
models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot
framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a
coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision
Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This
modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different
scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a
system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.
LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the
VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen
environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world
deployment.

Abstract: A novel approach for the fast onboard detection of isolated markers for
visual relative localisation of multiple teammates in agile UAV swarms is
introduced in this paper. As the detection forms a key component of real-time
localisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an
optimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally
equivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions,
the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by
two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the
localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant
overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to
detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on
various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency,
as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.
Thus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming.

Result: 实验证明LITEN能够从过去经验中学习，生成高可用性指令以完成长时程任务。

Conclusion: LITEN通过结合高层次VLM和低层次VLA策略，能够从失败中学习并调整行为，有效解决了复杂控制任务中的动态调整问题。

Abstract: Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we
fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy
accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics,
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving
complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically
readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we
introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA
low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by
including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and
capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning
phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an
assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful
conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar
approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on
unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires
structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate
LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that
use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: SEA方法通过结合语义地图预测和基于强化学习的分层探索策略，显著提升了机器人在有限步骤内构建准确语义地图的能力，并在实验中表现出优于现有技术的探索效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration
through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical
exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on
one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term
environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We
propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts
the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference
between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to
guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that
leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration
strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited
steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior
coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.

Motivation: 解决动态图中近似最大权重匹配问题，尤其是在非二分图上的现有方法存在较大近似损失的问题。

Method: 采用了一种新的原始对偶框架，将一般图中的近似MWM计算转化为辅助二分图上的近似诱导匹配查询序列。

Result: 首次实现了将二分图上的动态近似最大基数匹配算法转化为一般图上的动态近似最大权重匹配算法，且更新时间仅增加多项式对数因子。

Conclusion: 该论文通过提出一种新的元算法，显著缩小了加权与非加权图之间的差距，并首次实现了在一般图上的低损失近似最大权重匹配（MWM）。

Abstract: We study the approximate maximum weight matching (MWM) problem in a fully
dynamic graph subject to edge insertions and deletions. We design
meta-algorithms that reduce the problem to the unweighted approximate maximum
cardinality matching (MCM) problem. Despite recent progress on bipartite graphs
-- Bernstein-Dudeja-Langley (STOC 2021) and
Bernstein-Chen-Dudeja-Langley-Sidford-Tu (SODA 2025) -- the only previous
meta-algorithm that applied to non-bipartite graphs suffered a $\frac{1}{2}$
approximation loss (Stubbs-Williams, ITCS 2017). We significantly close the
weighted-and-unweighted gap by showing the first low-loss reduction that
transforms any fully dynamic $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate MCM algorithm on
bipartite graphs into a fully dynamic $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate MWM
algorithm on general (not necessarily bipartite) graphs, with only a
$\mathrm{poly}(\log n/\varepsilon)$ overhead in the update time. Central to our
approach is a new primal-dual framework that reduces the computation of an
approximate MWM in general graphs to a sequence of approximate induced matching
queries on an auxiliary bipartite extension. In addition, we give the first
conditional lower bound on approximate partially dynamic matching with
worst-case update time.

Motivation: 解决动态有序字典在时间和空间上的优化问题，特别是如何在不牺牲时间效率的情况下减少冗余空间。

Method: 主要技术构建块是一种称为压缩制表加权树（compressed tabulation-weighted treap）的动态平衡二叉搜索树，它实现了时间/空间的惊人平衡。

Result: 提出的方法在时间复杂度和空间消耗上均达到了最优或接近最优的水平，特别是在空间冗余方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了一种动态有序字典的构建方法，实现了最优的时间复杂度和接近最优的空间消耗，解决了Pibiri和Venturini提出的开放性问题，并首次突破了树结构瓶颈。

Abstract: We show how to construct a dynamic ordered dictionary, supporting
insert/delete/rank/select on a set of $n$ elements from a universe of size $U$,
that achieves the optimal amortized expected time complexity of $O(1 + \log n /
\log \log U)$, while achieving a nearly optimal space consumption of $\log
\binom{U}{n} + n / 2^{(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}} + \text{polylog}\, U$ bits in the
regime where $U = \text{poly}(n)$. This resolves an open question by Pibiri and
Venturini as to whether a redundancy (a.k.a. space overhead) of $o(n)$ bits is
possible, and is the first dynamic solution to bypass the so-called
tree-structure bottleneck, in which the bits needed to encode some dynamic tree
structure are themselves enough to force a redundancy of
$\widetilde{\Omega}(n)$ bits. Our main technical building block is a dynamic
balanced binary search tree, which we call the compressed tabulation-weighted
treap, that itself achieves a surprising time/space tradeoff. The tree supports
$\text{polylog}\, n$-time operations and requires a static lookup table of size
$\text{poly}(n) + \text{polylog}\, U$ -- but, in exchange for these, the tree
is able to achieve a remarkable space guarantee. Its total space redundancy is
$O(\log U)$ bits. In fact, if the tree is given $n$ and $U$ for free, then the
redundancy further drops to $O(1)$ bits.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种在线两阶段子模最大化（O2SSM）问题的算法，针对加权阈值势函数这一重要子类，在一般拟阵约束和均匀拟阵约束下实现了亚线性遗憾。

Abstract: Given a collection of monotone submodular functions, the goal of Two-Stage
Submodular Maximization (2SSM) [Balkanski et al., 2016] is to restrict the
ground set so an objective selected u.a.r. from the collection attains a high
maximal value, on average, when optimized over the restricted ground set. We
introduce the Online Two-Stage Submodular Maximization (O2SSM) problem, in
which the submodular objectives are revealed in an online fashion. We study
this problem for weighted threshold potential functions, a large and important
subclass of monotone submodular functions that includes influence maximization,
data summarization, and facility location, to name a few. We design an
algorithm that achieves sublinear $(1 - 1/e)^2$-regret under general matroid
constraints and $(1 - 1/e)(1-e^{-k}k^k/k!)$-regret in the case of uniform
matroids of rank $k$; the latter also yields a state-of-the-art bound for the
(offline) 2SSM problem. We empirically validate the performance of our online
algorithm with experiments on real datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多数据集（如图像、地图和邻接矩阵）本质上是二维且高度可压缩的，但将1D技术简单应用于2D数据会导致次优结果，因为线性化过程中丢失了基本结构重复性。

Method: 设计了支持2D语法压缩字符串随机访问的数据结构，并基于正交向量猜想证明了条件性下界，分析了2D查询在1D困难性假设下的效率限制。

Result: 实现了对2D语法压缩字符串的$O(\log n/\log \log n)$查询时间和$O(|G|\log^{2+\epsilon}n)$空间复杂度，证明了2D模式匹配的条件性下界，并展示了2D查询在1D困难性假设下的效率限制。

Conclusion: 论文提出了三种主要贡献，包括设计首个支持2D语法压缩字符串最优时间随机访问的数据结构、证明2D语法压缩字符串模式匹配的条件性下界，以及展示几种基本2D查询在1D语法压缩字符串上的困难性假设下无法高效支持，将2D压缩索引的复杂性与1D长期未解决的问题联系起来。

Abstract: Compressed indexing is a powerful technique that enables efficient querying
over data stored in compressed form, significantly reducing memory usage and
often accelerating computation. While extensive progress has been made for
one-dimensional strings, many real-world datasets (such as images, maps, and
adjacency matrices) are inherently two-dimensional and highly compressible.
Unfortunately, naively applying 1D techniques to 2D data leads to suboptimal
results, as fundamental structural repetition is lost during linearization.
This motivates the development of native 2D compressed indexing schemes that
preserve both compression and query efficiency.
  We present three main contributions that advance the theory of compressed
indexing for 2D strings: (1) We design the first data structure that supports
optimal-time random access to a 2D string compressed by a 2D grammar.
Specifically, for a 2D string $T\in\Sigma^{r\times c}$ compressed by a 2D
grammar $G$ and any constant $\epsilon>0$, we achieve $O(\log n/\log \log n)$
query time and $O(|G|\log^{2+\epsilon}n)$ space, where $n=\max(r,c)$. (2) We
prove conditional lower bounds for pattern matching over 2D-grammar compressed
strings. Assuming the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture, no algorithm can solve
this problem in time $O(|G|^{2-\epsilon}\cdot |P|^{O(1)})$ for any
$\epsilon>0$, demonstrating a separation from the 1D case, where optimal
solutions exist. (3) We show that several fundamental 2D queries, such as the
2D longest common extension, rectangle sum, and equality, cannot be supported
efficiently under hardness assumptions for rank and symbol occurrence queries
on 1D grammar-compressed strings. This is the first evidence connecting the
complexity of 2D compressed indexing to long-standing open problems in the 1D
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非负加权有向图中并行计算单源最短路径（SSSP）的工作深度权衡问题，并为稠密图提供首个接近线性工作且次线性深度的算法。同时，改进强多项式并行算法在相关优化问题中的应用。

Result: 证明了有向SSSP可以在$\tilde{O}(m+n^{2-\epsilon})$工作和$\tilde{O}(n^{1-\epsilon})$深度下解决，其中$\epsilon>0$。此外，结果还改进了最小成本流和分配问题的强多项式并行算法，并首次提出了最小平均环的非平凡动态算法。

Conclusion: 本文展示了在非负加权有向图中并行计算单源最短路径（SSSP）的新强多项式工作深度权衡，并提供了首个在稠密图中具有接近线性工作且次线性深度的算法。此外，结果还改进了强多项式并行算法在最小成本流和分配问题中的应用，并首次提出了最小平均环的非平凡动态算法。

Abstract: In this paper, we show new strongly polynomial work-depth tradeoffs for
computing single-source shortest paths (SSSP) in non-negatively weighted
directed graphs in parallel. Most importantly, we prove that directed SSSP can
be solved within $\tilde{O}(m+n^{2-\epsilon})$ work and
$\tilde{O}(n^{1-\epsilon})$ depth for some positive $\epsilon>0$. In
particular, for dense graphs with non-negative real weights, we provide the
first nearly work-efficient strongly polynomial algorithm with sublinear depth.
  Our result immediately yields improved strongly polynomial parallel
algorithms for min-cost flow and the assignment problem. It also leads to the
first non-trivial strongly polynomial dynamic algorithm for minimum mean cycle.
Moreover, we develop efficient parallel algorithms in the Word RAM model for
several variants of SSSP in graphs with exponentially large edge weights.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的逻辑$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$，统一并扩展了在具有深度$k$的消除森林的图上可高效解决的NP难问题的结果，并提供了高效的模型检查算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的主要动机是统一和扩展已知在具有深度$k$的消除森林的图上可高效解决的NP难问题（如独立集和哈密顿环）的结果，并为更多问题提供高效的算法。

Method: 论文引入了一种称为$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$的逻辑，扩展了完全存在的$\mathsf{MSO}_2$，并增加了对顶点集邻域的广义查询、连通性和无环性验证以及团验证的谓词。论文还提供了这种逻辑的模型检查算法，其时间复杂度和空间复杂度分别为$2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$和$n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$。

Result: 论文的主要结果是提出了一种新的逻辑$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$，并证明了其模型检查算法的时间复杂度为$2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$，空间复杂度为$n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$。对于不含连通性和无环性约束的片段$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{k}$，空间复杂度进一步优化为$\mathcal{O}(k\log(n))$。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的逻辑$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$，能够统一并扩展已知在具有深度$k$的消除森林的图上可高效解决的NP难问题的结果。此外，对于不包含连通性和无环性约束的片段$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{k}$，还进一步优化了空间复杂度。

Abstract: For a graph $G$, the parameter treedepth measures the minimum depth among all
forests $F$, called elimination forests, such that $G$ is a subgraph of the
ancestor-descendant closure of $F$. We introduce a logic, called neighborhood
operator logic with acyclicity, connectivity and clique constraints
($\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ for short), that captures all
NP-hard problems$\unicode{x2013}$like Independent Set or Hamiltonian
Cycle$\unicode{x2013}$that are known to be tractable in time
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ and space $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ on
$n$-vertex graphs provided with elimination forests of depth $k$. We provide a
model checking algorithm for $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ with
such complexity that unifies and extends these results. For
$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{k}$, the fragment of the above logic
that does not use acyclicity and connectivity constraints, we get a
strengthening of this result, where the space complexity is reduced to
$\mathcal{O}(k\log(n))$.
  With a similar mechanism as the distance neighborhood logic introduced in
[Bergougnoux, Dreier and Jaffke, SODA 2023], the logic
$\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]+\mathsf{ACK}$ is an extension of the
fully-existential $\mathsf{MSO}_2$ with predicates for (1) querying
generalizations of the neighborhoods of vertex sets, (2) verifying the
connectivity and acyclicity of vertex and edge sets, and (3) verifying that a
vertex set induces a clique. Our results provide
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time and $n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ space
algorithms for problems for which the existence of such algorithms was
previously unknown. In particular, $\mathsf{NEO}_2[\mathsf{FRec}]$ captures
CNF-SAT via the incidence graphs associated to CNF formulas, and it also
captures several modulo counting problems like Odd Dominating Set.

Motivation: 研究如何在不显式存储后缀数组的情况下高效访问其条目，以解决字符串处理中的核心问题。

Method: 采用双向归约技术，将后缀数组查询与前缀选择查询在空间、查询时间和预处理时间上建立等价关系。

Result: 证明了后缀数组查询与前缀选择查询在参数上的等价性，并扩展至逆后缀数组查询、模式排名等问题，识别了六个核心问题对。

Conclusion: 本文通过首次提出的双向归约方法，证明了后缀数组查询与前缀选择查询在大多数参数上的等价性，为字符串处理问题提供了统一的分析框架。

Abstract: We study the fundamental question of how efficiently suffix array entries can
be accessed when the array cannot be stored explicitly. The suffix array
$SA_T[1..n]$ of a text $T$ of length $n$ encodes the lexicographic order of its
suffixes and underlies numerous applications in pattern matching, data
compression, and bioinformatics. Previous work established one-way reductions
showing how suffix array queries can be answered using, for example, rank
queries on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform. More recently, a new class of prefix
queries was introduced, together with reductions that, among others, transform
a simple tradeoff for prefix-select queries into a suffix array tradeoff
matching state-of-the-art space and query-time bounds, while achieving
sublinear construction time. For binary texts, the resulting data structure
achieves space $O(n)$ bits, preprocessing time $O(n / \sqrt{\log n})$,
preprocessing space of $O(n)$ bits, and query time $O(\log^{\epsilon} n)$ for
any constant $\epsilon > 0$. However, whether these bounds could be improved
using different techniques has remained open.
  We resolve this question by presenting the first bidirectional reduction
showing that suffix array queries are, up to an additive $O(\log\log n)$ term
in query time, equivalent to prefix-select queries in all parameters. This
result unifies prior approaches and shows that essentially all efficient suffix
array representations can be expressed via prefix-select structures. Moreover,
we prove analogous equivalences for inverse suffix array queries, pattern
ranking, lexicographic range, and SA-interval queries, identifying six core
problem pairs that connect string and prefix query models. Our framework thus
provides a unified foundation for analyzing and improving the efficiency of
fundamental string-processing problems through the lens of prefix queries.

*Dominik Kempa,Tomasz Kociumaka*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该研究填补了压缩数据结构中查询时间复杂度的理论空白，证明了多种基本查询的时间下界，为未来数据结构设计提供了明确目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究压缩数据结构的极限，即在压缩形式下支持各种查询的空间效率问题。目前，几乎所有基本查询都可以在$O(\delta(T)\log^{O(1)}n)$空间内高效支持，但只有随机访问的查询时间被完全表征。

Method: 通过开发严格的下界，研究了几乎所有其他基本查询的时间复杂度，包括后缀数组（SA）、逆后缀数组（SA$^{-1}$）、最长公共前缀（LCP）数组和最长公共扩展（LCE）查询。

Result: 证明了SA、SA$^{-1}$、LCP和LCE查询在$O(\delta(T)\log^{O(1)}n)$空间内需要$\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$时间，而其他常见查询（如BWT、PLCP、LF等）需要$\Omega(\log\log n)$时间。

Conclusion: 这项研究为压缩索引奠定了理论基础，填补了上界与下界之间的关键空白，并为未来数据结构提供了明确目标：在最小空间中寻求最优时间或在最优空间中寻求最快时间。

Abstract: In this work, we study the limits of compressed data structures, i.e.,
structures that support various queries on an input text $T\in\Sigma^n$ using
space proportional to the size of $T$ in compressed form. Nearly all
fundamental queries can currently be efficiently supported in
$O(\delta(T)\log^{O(1)}n)$ space, where $\delta(T)$ is the substring
complexity, a strong compressibility measure that lower-bounds the optimal
space to represent the text [Kociumaka, Navarro, Prezza, IEEE Trans. Inf.
Theory 2023]. However, optimal query time has been characterized only for
random access.
  We address this gap by developing tight lower bounds for nearly all other
fundamental queries: (1) We prove that suffix array (SA), inverse suffix array
(SA$^{-1}$), longest common prefix (LCP) array, and longest common extension
(LCE) queries all require $\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$ time within
$O(\delta(T)\log^{O(1)}n)$ space, matching known upper bounds. (2) We further
show that other common queries, currently supported in $O(\log\log n)$ time and
$O(\delta(T)\log^{O(1)}n)$ space, including the Burrows-Wheeler Transform
(BWT), permuted longest common prefix (PLCP) array, Last-to-First (LF), inverse
LF, lexicographic predecessor ($\Phi$), and inverse $\Phi$ queries, all require
$\Omega(\log\log n)$ time, yielding another set of tight bounds.
  Our lower bounds hold even for texts over a binary alphabet. This work
establishes a clean dichotomy: the optimal time complexity to support central
string queries in compressed space is either $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ or
$\Theta(\log\log n)$. This completes the theoretical foundation of compressed
indexing, closing a crucial gap between upper and lower bounds and providing a
clear target for future data structures: seeking either the optimal time in the
smallest space or the fastest time in the optimal space, both of which are now
known for central string queries.

Abstract: Graph vertex ordering is widely employed in spatial data analysis, especially
in urban analytics, where street graphs serve as spatial discretization for
modeling and simulation. It is also crucial for visualization, as many methods
require vertices to be arranged in a well-defined order to reveal non-trivial
patterns. The goal of vertex ordering methods is to preserve neighborhood
relations, but the structural complexity of real-world graphs often introduces
distortions. Comparing different ordering methods is therefore essential to
identify the most suitable one for each application. Existing metrics for
assessing spatial vertex ordering typically focus on global quality, which
hinders the identification of localized distortions. Visual evaluation is
particularly valuable, as it allows analysts to compare methods within a single
visualization, assess distortions, identify anomalous regions, and, in urban
contexts, explain spatial inconsistencies. This work presents a
visualization-assisted tool for assessing vertex ordering techniques, with a
focus on urban analytics. We evaluate geometric and topological ordering
approaches using urban street graphs. The visual tool integrates existing and
newly proposed metrics, validated through experiments on data from multiple
cities. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively supports
users in selecting suitable vertex ordering techniques, tuning hyperparameters,
and identifying regions with high ordering distortions.

Motivation: 尽管测试时间缩放与验证在提升大语言模型性能方面显示出潜力，但验证器的作用及其缺陷尚未得到充分探索。论文旨在填补这一空白，提供一个统一的框架来量化这些因素的交互。

Method: 论文提出了一个统一的框架，将可验证的测试时间缩放视为传输问题，量化了覆盖率、ROC和次优性的几何交互，并分析了顺序和批量采样算法的计算复杂性。

Result: 研究发现次优性-覆盖率曲线呈现三种状态：传输状态、策略改进状态和饱和状态。顺序和批量采样算法的计算复杂性对这些权衡产生了影响。实证结果支持了理论发现。

Conclusion: 论文通过将可验证的测试时间缩放框架化为传输问题，揭示了覆盖率、ROC和次优性之间的相互作用，并提出了三类采样算法，实证结果支持了理论发现。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 当前机器学习在临床诊断中的应用多为静态数据集，无法反映临床医生实际的序列化和资源感知推理过程，亟需能够支持及时、经济高效决策的框架。

Method: ACTMED结合了贝叶斯实验设计（BED）和大语言模型（LLMs），逐步选择能最大程度减少诊断不确定性的测试。LLMs作为灵活的模拟器，生成患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需结构化任务数据。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估表明，ACTMED能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源利用效率。

Conclusion: ACTMED框架通过整合贝叶斯实验设计和大语言模型，提供了一种透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统，能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源利用效率。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

Motivation: 现有的基于人类偏好的奖励模型容易因过度优化而出现奖励黑客行为，依赖与训练数据中人类偏好标签相关的虚假特征，而非真正反映目标意图。

Conclusion: PRISM方法通过引入群不变核学习，有效减少了奖励模型对捷径行为的依赖，提升了在分布外任务上的准确性，为基于偏好的对齐提供了稳健框架。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in

Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a

representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including

Conclusion: 现有的方法在信息有限的情况下不足以有效解决模式选择问题，凸显了该任务的持续挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

Conclusion: WebGraphEval 通过将网络代理的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，提出了一种通用的多路径、跨代理和效率感知的评估方法，弥补了当前评估方法的不足。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了DSA框架，为不一致先例的广义原因模型提供了论证性解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统一致原因模型下的论证性解释方法无法适用于不一致先例的推理，因此需要开发新的解释框架。

Method: 本文采用推导状态论证框架（DSA-framework）的扩展方法，以适应广义原因模型的解释需求。

Result: 成功扩展了DSA框架，使其能够解释基于广义原因模型的推理过程。

Conclusion: 本文通过扩展DSA框架，为广义原因模型提供了一种论证性解释方法，填补了不一致先例推理中的空白。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多代理LLM模拟框架，探讨LLM代理是否能复制人类在线社交动态，实验显示其能形成类似现实社区的稳定互动和网络结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLM）代理是否能复制人类在线行为的复杂社交动态，以及哪些记忆和学习机制能使这些动态出现。

Method: 提出了一个多代理LLM模拟框架，其中代理通过上下文学习和教练信号加速的行为适应来反复互动和评估彼此。

Result: 实验显示，经过训练的LLM代理形成稳定的互动模式和新兴社交关系，产生与现实在线社区相似网络结构。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合行为奖励和上下文适应，为研究LLM群体中的集体动态提供了一个原则性测试平台，并揭示了人工代理如何近似或偏离人类社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

Motivation: 现实环境通常是非平稳的，现有持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出了持续知识适应策略（维护任务特定知识向量池并动态利用历史知识）和自适应知识合并机制（合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求）。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL 在整体性能上提升了 4.20%，在前向迁移上提升了 8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL 通过持续知识适应策略和自适应知识合并机制，有效解决了持续强化学习中的灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个多跳、端到端工具编排的大规模基准，通过‘同等功能集’减少评估偏差，揭示代理在复杂编排中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准通常孤立评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估过于乐观。

Method: 通过构建‘同等功能集’作为基准，使用F1分数等客观指标，减少对LLM-as-a-judge评估的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，僵化的层次结构可能阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架，揭示了现有LLM代理在工具编排中的局限性，并指导开发更高效的工具使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at
https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成式AI在生成某些形式的规范方面显示出潜力，但现有工作主要针对小型代码而非完整系统。需要评估AI是否能处理现实系统工件，将复杂行为属性抽象为形式模型。

Method: 使用TLA+作为规范语言，通过自动化指标（如语法和运行时正确性、系统代码一致性及不变量正确性）评估AI生成的模型。

Result: SysMoBench包含九种多样化的系统工件（如Etcd的Raft实现、Redis、Asterinas OS的Spinlock和Mutex等），并持续扩展，为研究提供了丰富资源。

Conclusion: SysMoBench为评估AI在大型复杂系统建模中的能力提供了基准，揭示了当前LLMs和代理的潜力与局限，为该领域的研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

Motivation: 解决在动态环境中采用语言模型进行体现任务时，由于延迟、连接性和资源限制而无法在线访问大规模推理引擎或符号规划器的挑战。

Method: NeSyPr框架首先生成任务特定计划，然后将其转化为可组合的程序表示，以编码计划的隐式生产规则，使程序能够无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等体现基准测试中，NeSyPr展示了其高效推理能力，优于大规模推理模型和符号规划器，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: NeSyPr通过神经符号程序化编译知识，为基于语言模型的智能体提供了结构化、自适应和及时推理能力，适用于延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言理解和遵循人类指令是智能代理的关键能力，但语言指令的灵活性导致任务间存在大量模糊性，严重影响了算法性能。

Method: 提出了名为DAIL（Distributional Aligned Learning）的新方法，包含两个关键组件：分布策略和语义对齐模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，DAIL在结构化和视觉观察基准测试中有效解决了指令模糊性问题，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL方法通过分布策略和语义对齐有效解决了语言指令的模糊性问题，在结构化和视觉观察基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

TL;DR: HSCodeComp 是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用中性能的基准，结果显示代理在复杂规则应用上表现远逊于人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准忽视了复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册和关税规则）的应用能力，而这些规则在实际中至关重要。

Method: 引入 HSCodeComp 基准，构建了 632 个产品条目，由人类专家标注 HSCode，并测试了多种先进 LLM 和代理的性能。

Result: 最佳代理的 10 位 HSCode 准确率仅为 46.8%，远低于人类专家的 95.0%。

Conclusion: HSCodeComp 是第一个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用中的基准，揭示了当前代理在复杂规则应用中的巨大性能差距。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Method: 引入AgentSense，一个混合的、无需训练的框架，通过多智能体进化系统将大型语言模型（LLMs）集成到参与式城市感知中。初始使用经典规划器生成基线解决方案，然后迭代优化以适应动态城市条件和异构工人偏好。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰上的广泛实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，同时在性能和鲁棒性上也优于单智能体LLM基线。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了在部署适应性强且可解释的基于网络的参与式城市感知系统方面的重要进展。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Result: 开发了一个基于图的引擎，能够生成和弦音独奏建议，并通过用户友好系统实现输入输出。

Conclusion: 本文介绍了一种基于图的引擎，用于为吉他学生提供和弦音独奏建议，通过构建加权图并计算最短路径来生成和弦音独奏线，最终设计了一个用户友好的系统便于学生练习。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

TL;DR: RLIE 是一个结合LLMs与概率建模的统一框架，通过四阶段流程学习加权规则集，实验表明直接应用规则优于LLM提示注入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM基于方法中规则间交互的忽视，以及将LLMs与概率规则学习结合以实现稳健推理的未充分探索机会。

Method: RLIE 包含四个阶段：规则生成、逻辑回归学习概率权重、迭代精炼规则集以及评估。

Result: 直接应用带有学习权重的规则表现更优，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出注入LLM提示反而降低准确性。

Conclusion: RLIE 框架阐明了LLMs在归纳推理中的潜力与限制，并通过结合经典概率规则组合方法，实现了更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖固定大小的记忆或全上下文transformer，无法有效处理视觉输入对transformer上下文限制的挑战。Memo旨在通过记忆压缩和抽象来解决这一问题。

Method: Memo通过训练期间在模型输入中插入周期性摘要标记来创建和检索记忆，结合了transformer的优势和记忆管理机制。

Result: Memo在网格世界元RL基准和逼真室内多目标导航任务中表现优异，优于传统长上下文transformer基线，且计算和存储效率更高。

Conclusion: Memo是一种基于transformer的架构和训练方法，用于内存密集型、长期任务。它在性能和效率上优于传统长上下文transformer基线，并在推理时表现出更好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基准测试局限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和较长时长的推理能力，因此需要一个新的评估框架。

Method: PROBE（Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks）将主动性分解为三个核心能力的管道：（1）搜索未指定的问题，（2）识别具体的瓶颈，（3）执行适当的解决方案。

Result: 最佳端到端性能为40%，由GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1实现。论文还展示了各模型的相对能力并分析了共同的失败模式。

Conclusion: 论文强调了自主行动在智能体系统中的当前局限性，并揭示了未来有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results

TL;DR: WorldTest是一种评估模型学习代理的新协议，通过AutumnBench实例化，发现人类优于模型且计算扩展效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的世界模型学习和评估方法偏离了支持多种下游任务的目标，WorldTest旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了WorldTest协议，包括无奖励交互阶段和在不同但相关环境中的评分测试阶段，并实例化为AutumnBench，包含43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务。

Result: 人类表现优于前沿模型，计算资源的扩展仅在某些环境中提高性能。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了一个新颖的模板来评估代理对环境动态的学习情况，而AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习中的显著提升空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

TL;DR: SWOT提出了一种动态光网络框架，通过“集体内重配置”和重叠调度技术，优化了分布式机器学习中的集体通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光互连方案在支持复杂集体通信算法时面临可扩展性限制，需要更灵活的资源配置方法。

Method: SWOT采用“集体内重配置”策略，动态调整网络资源以匹配通信模式，并结合了重叠光开关重配置与传输的调度技术。

Result: 模拟结果显示SWOT在性能上有显著提升。

Conclusion: SWOT通过动态网络资源分配和创新的调度技术，显著提升了分布式机器学习训练中的集体通信效率。

Abstract: Collective communication (CC) is widely adopted for large-scale distributed
machine learning (DML) training workloads. DML's predictable traffic pattern
provides a great oppotunity for applying optical network technology. Existing
optical interconnects-based CC schemes adopt ``one-shot network
reconfiguration'', which provisions static high-capacity topologies for an
entire collective operation -- sometimes for a full training iteration.
However, this approach faces significant scalability limitations when
supporting more complex and efficient CC algorithms required for modern
workloads: the ``one-shot'' strategies either demand excessive resource
overprovisioning or suffer performance degradation due to rigid resource
allocation.
  To address these challenges, we propose SWOT, a demand-aware optical network
framework. SWOT employs ``intra-collective reconfiguration'' and can
dynamically align network resources with CC traffic patterns. SWOT incorporates
a novel scheduling technique that overlaps optical switch reconfigurations with
ongoing transmissions, and improves communication efficiency. SWOT introduce a
lightweight collective communication shim that enables coordinated optical
network configuration and transmission scheduling while supporting seamless
integration with existing CC libraries. Our simulation results demonstrate
SWOT's significant performance improvements.

Abstract: The increase in computation and storage has led to a significant growth in
the scale of systems powering applications and services, raising concerns about
sustainability and operational costs. In this paper, we explore power-saving
techniques in high-performance computing (HPC) and datacenter networks, and
their relation with performance degradation. From this premise, we propose
leveraging Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE), with the flexibility to extend to
conventional Ethernet or upcoming Ethernet-derived interconnect versions of BXI
and Omnipath.
  We analyze the PerfBound proposal, identifying possible improvements and
modeling it into a simulation framework. Through different experiments, we
examine its impact on performance and determine the most appropriate
interconnect. We also study traffic patterns generated by selected HPC and
machine learning applications to evaluate the behavior of power-saving
techniques.
  From these experiments, we provide an analysis of how applications affect
system and network energy consumption. Based on this, we disclose the weakness
of dynamic power-down mechanisms and propose an approach that improves energy
reduction with minimal or no performance penalty. To our knowledge, this is the
first power management proposal tailored to future Ethernet-based HPC
architectures, with promising results.
