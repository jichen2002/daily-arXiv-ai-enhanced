Inspired by query-based tracking\nframeworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and\ntracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without\nthe need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates\nidentities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for\nrobust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to\ntracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a\nmoving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial\nconsistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that\nquery-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal\nsensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA\nof 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D\nMOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive\naccuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving\ntransformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods\neven with limited data and without pretraining."}

One of the most widely used\nmethods is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is used in many of the\nconsumer-grade polymer 3D printers available today. While consumer grade\nmachines are cheap and plentiful, they lack many of the features desired in a\nmachine used for research purposes and are often closed-source platforms.\nCommercial-grade models are more expensive and are also usually closed-source\nplatforms that do not offer flexibility for modifications often needed for\nresearch. The authors designed and fabricated a machine to be used as a test\nbed for research in the field of polymer FDM processes. The goal was to create\na platform that tightly controls and/or monitors the FDM build parameters so\nthat experiments can be repeated with a known accuracy. The platform offers\nclosed loop position feedback, control of the hot end and bed temperature, and\nmonitoring of environment temperature and humidity. Additionally, the platform\nis equipped with cameras and a mechanism for in-situ photogrammetry, creating a\ngeometric record of the printing throughout the printing process. Through\nphotogrammetry, backtracking and linking process parameters to observable\ngeometric defects can be achieved. This paper focuses on the design of a novel\nmechanism for spinning the heated bed to allow for photogrammetric\nreconstruction of the printed part using a minimal number of cameras, as\nimplemented on this platform."}

To support efficient set operations (e.g.,\nunion, intersection, difference) using trees, the join-based framework is\nwidely studied. This framework has received particular attention in the\nparallel setting, and has been shown to be effective in enabling simple and\ntheoretically efficient set operations on trees. Despite the widespread\nadoption of parallel join-based trees, a major drawback of previous work on\nsuch data structures is the inefficiency of their input/output (I/O) access\npatterns. Some recent work (e.g., C-trees and PaC-trees) focused on more\nI/O-friendly implementations of these algorithms. Surprisingly, however, there\nhave been no results on bounding the I/O-costs for these algorithms. It remains\nopen whether these algorithms can provide tight, provable guarantees in\nI/O-costs on trees.\n  This paper studies efficient parallel algorithms for set operations based on\nsearch tree algorithms using a join-based framework, with a special focus on\nachieving I/O efficiency in these algorithms. To better capture the\nI/O-efficiency in these algorithms in parallel, we introduce a new\ncomputational model, Fork-Join I/O Model, to measure the I/O costs in fork-join\nparallelism. This model measures the total block transfers (I/O work) and their\ncritical path (I/O span). Under this model, we propose our new solution based\non B-trees.

However, its\nquadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.\nGiven that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing\nefforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a\npersistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations\nhave not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this\npaper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what\nprinciples give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental\ninsights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research\n(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \\textit{Adaptive routing}:\nSA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic\ncontent, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.\n(2) \\textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token\nweighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,\nwhereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable\nredundancy. Based on this, we propose \\textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),\na principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically\ninjects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\\times3$ kernels, ATConv\nconsistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.\nBuilding on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain\n\\textbf{84.4\\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters.

It\nhas made accessible to everyone including visually impaired individuals. With\nthe use of smartphone cameras, image capturing and processing have become more\nconvenient. With the use of smartphones and machine learning, the life of\nvisually impaired can be made a little easier. Daily tasks such as handling\nmoney without relying on someone can be troublesome for them. For that purpose\nthis paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist\nvisually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset\ncontaining 30 classes of notes and coins, representing 3 types of currency: US\ndollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Bangladeshi taka (BDT). Our approach uses a\nYOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional\nlayers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to enhance feature extraction and\ndetection accuracy. Our model has achieved a higher accuracy of 97.73%, recall\nof 95.23%, f1-score of 95.85% and a mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5\n(mAP50(B)) of 97.21\\%.

Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive\nFine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and\nimplicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights\nfor each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal\nbit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry\ncompression.
