### [1] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过敏感度分数有效减少3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外视角下的视觉噪声，显著提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外视角下因缺乏训练数据而产生的视觉噪声问题。

Method: 利用中间梯度衍生的敏感度分数，针对由各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，直接解决生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在视觉质量、真实感和一致性方面显著优于现有的基于NeRF的方法（如BayesRays），并能实时集成到现有渲染流程中。

Conclusion: 提出的实时渲染感知过滤方法显著提高了在训练数据分布外视角下的3D高斯泼溅模型的视觉质量、真实感和一致性，且无需大量后训练或微调即可无缝集成到现有渲染流程中。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [2] [From Far and Near: Perceptual Evaluation of Crowd Representations Across Levels of Detail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20558)
*Xiaohan Sun,Carol O'Sullivan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究分析了不同LoD和距离下人群视觉质量的感知差异，为优化渲染策略提供依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨用户在不同细节层次（LoD）和观看距离下对人群视觉质量的感知差异。

Method: 采用几何网格、基于图像的替代物、神经辐射场（NeRFs）和3D高斯等不同表示方法，结合定性和定量分析。

Result: 揭示了各种表示方法在视觉保真度和计算性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为人群渲染提供了感知优化的LoD策略设计指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how users perceive the visual quality of crowd
character representations at different levels of detail (LoD) and viewing
distances. Each representation: geometric meshes, image-based impostors, Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and 3D Gaussians, exhibits distinct trade-offs between
visual fidelity and computational performance. Our qualitative and quantitative
results provide insights to guide the design of perceptually optimized LoD
strategies for crowd rendering.

### [3] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过频域分析和深度学习，成功区分了StyleGAN生成图像与真实图像，准确率达92.8%，展示了其在数字取证中的工业应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GAN生成的高度逼真图像迅速增加，图像取证和需要可靠内容真实性的工业系统面临严峻挑战，因此需要有效的方法来区分真实与合成图像。

Method: 使用二维离散傅里叶变换（2D DFT）将图像转换到傅里叶域，利用ResNet50神经网络在变换后的图像上进行训练，以区分真实与合成图像。

Result: 频域模型在实验中达到了92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的模型。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法结合了频域分析和深度学习，显著提高了区分真实图像与StyleGAN生成图像的能力，展示了在数字取证和增强工业AI系统可信度方面的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [4] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTs与对比学习结合，有效提升3D形状表示学习性能，减少标注数据需求，ModelNet10准确率达90.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉方法在处理从2D图像识别3D物体时面临挑战，如需要大量标注数据且依赖CNNs可能忽略关键形状关系。本研究旨在探索ViTs与对比学习结合是否能更有效地学习3D形状表示。

Method: 研究采用了基于Vision Transformers（ViTs）的架构与现代对比学习目标相结合的方法，通过多视角3D分析任务验证其有效性。具体包括监督对比损失（如ModelNet10上达到90.6%准确率）和自监督学习目标。

Result: 实验结果表明，ViTs结合对比学习目标在多视角3D分析任务中表现优异，监督对比损失在ModelNet10上达到90.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 论文通过结合Vision Transformers（ViTs）和对比学习目标，成功解决了3D形状特征表示学习中的挑战，特别是在减少对大量标注数据的依赖和克服CNNs在捕捉关键形状关系上的局限性方面取得了显著成果。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [5] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack 是一种多模态相机-LiDAR 跟踪框架，通过 transformer 平滑和融合跟踪提升性能，在 nuScenes 和 KITTI 上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受基于查询的跟踪框架启发，旨在解决遮挡和视角变化下的鲁棒重识别问题，同时通过多模态传感器特征提升跟踪性能。

Method: FutrTrack 采用模块化的相机-LiDAR 多目标跟踪框架，结合基于 transformer 的平滑器和融合驱动的跟踪器。通过多模态两阶段 transformer 精炼和跟踪流程，集成边界框与多模态 BEV 融合特征，无需显式运动模型。

Result: 在 nuScenes 和 KITTI 数据集上，FutrTrack 表现出色，nuScenes 测试集的 aMOTA 达到 74.7，显著减少了身份切换并保持了竞争性精度。

Conclusion: FutrTrack 提供了一个高效的框架，通过多模态传感器特征显著提升了基于查询的 transformer 跟踪方法的性能，即使在数据有限且无需预训练的情况下，也能与其他基于神经网络的方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [6] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑（OLS）通过动态调整软标签，显著提升了医学图像分类的准确性和特征学习效果，同时增强了预测的校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中表现出色，但常产生过度自信的预测，影响其在关键医疗场景中的可靠性。传统标签平滑方法未能考虑类别间关系，因此需要更动态的解决方案。

Method: 本研究探索了在线标签平滑（OLS）的使用，这是一种动态方法，根据模型的预测模式在训练过程中调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上使用ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构进行了评估。

Result: OLS在Top-1和Top-5分类准确率上均优于标准训练方法（包括硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏），并产生了更紧凑且分离良好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅提升了预测性能，还增强了校准性，使其成为医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出针对鱼眼图像优化的检测框架，通过预处理、后处理和模型集成提升检测效果，在竞赛中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在广域交通监控中具有优势，但其径向失真和非均匀分辨率对标准物体检测器构成挑战，尤其在图像边界区域。

Method: 采用预处理和后处理流程增强检测一致性，并集成多个先进检测模型以提高精度。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中，F1得分为0.6366，排名第8/62。

Conclusion: 该框架通过预处理和后处理流程以及集成策略，在鱼眼图像中实现了稳健的物体检测，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [8] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle结合物理建模与机器学习，通过两阶段方法显著提升超声脑成像的声速图定量准确性，实验证明其优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声脑成像面临颅骨与脑组织声速差异大、探头耦合困难等挑战，传统物理建模方法受限于信号弱和空间覆盖不全，而纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下难以准确建模波传播。

Method: 该研究采用了两阶段方法：第一阶段应用逆时偏移（时间反转声学）处理多角度采集数据，生成保留结构细节的迁移片段；第二阶段通过基于变压器的超分辨率编码器-解码器与图注意力单元（GAU）融合这些片段，生成连贯且定量准确的SoS图像。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，BrainPuzzle在SoS重建准确性和图像完整性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle提出了一种结合物理建模与机器学习的两阶段混合框架，显著提高了超声脑成像中声速（SoS）图的定量准确性，为定量超声脑成像的发展提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估生成图像模型的文化偏见，发现I2I编辑会削弱文化保真度，模型倾向于表面修改而非深层文化适应，提供标准化基准以促进未来研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成图像模型虽能产生引人注目的视觉效果，但常存在文化误表达。先前研究主要关注文本到图像（T2I）系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像（I2I）编辑器的研究不足，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究采用统一评估方法，涵盖六个国家、8个类别/36个子类别的模式，以及时代感知提示。使用固定设置的开放模型进行跨国家、跨时代和跨类别评估，结合标准自动指标、文化感知的检索增强VQA和本地评审专家的判断。

Result: 研究发现：(1)在国家无关提示下，模型倾向于默认全球北方、现代倾向的描绘，模糊了国家间差异；(2)迭代I2I编辑会削弱文化保真度，即使传统指标保持稳定或改善；(3)I2I模型应用表面线索（如调色板变化、通用道具）而非时代一致、上下文感知的变化，常保留源目标对全球南方目标的身份。

Conclusion: 当前生成图像模型在文化敏感性编辑方面仍不可靠，研究通过标准化数据、提示和人类评估协议，提供了一个可复现的文化中心基准，用于诊断和跟踪生成图像模型中的文化偏见。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [10] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIBAR是一种基于滤波器的异步图像重建方法，比神经网络更简单高效，适用于某些任务，但噪声和鬼影较多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从移动事件相机的事件中重建强度图像是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有方法通常依赖于GPU上的神经网络，计算复杂度高。

Method: 首先，通过时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件信号强度变化；然后，通过新颖算法检测过时像素并调节最近更新像素窗口；最后，对过时像素进行高斯滤波。

Result: FIBAR是一种异步方法，可在现代笔记本电脑CPU上以约42（140）百万事件/秒的速度运行（带/不带空间滤波）。

Conclusion: FIBAR方法虽然比基于神经网络的方法（如FireNet）重建的图像噪声更大且存在鬼影，但对于某些任务（如检测基准标记）已经足够。代码已开源。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了TBTLRR模型，通过学习任意酉变换和双边结构，有效提升图像聚类的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换且对噪声鲁棒性差，需要更有效的方法来捕捉全局和局部相关性。

Method: 提出了一种称为TBTLRR的新型变换双边张量低秩表示模型，通过学习任意酉变换引入数据自适应的张量核范数，并利用潜在张量数据的双边结构和集成$\ell_{1/2}$-范数及Frobenius范数正则化项来处理复杂噪声。

Result: TBTLRR在聚类任务中优于现有方法，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TBTLRR模型在图像聚类任务中表现出色，优于现有方法，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endoshare 是一个开源跨平台应用，用于合并、标准化和去识别化内窥镜手术视频，通过用户反馈和隐私设计提高可用性，测试显示高接受度和推荐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学可以推动手术培训、研究和质量改进，但广泛使用受到异构记录格式和与视频共享相关的隐私问题的限制。

Method: 开发遵循软件开发生命周期，采用迭代式、以用户为中心的反馈。在分析阶段，基于十项可用性启发式的临床医生和计算机科学家内部调查确定了关键需求，指导了隐私设计架构。测试阶段结合了相同的启发式与技术接受模型构建，评估可用性和采纳度，并通过不同硬件配置的基准测试进行补充。

Result: 初始测试显示高可用性（临床医生4.68±0.40/5，计算机科学家4.03±0.51/5），改进后测试的十位外科医生报告了高感知有用性（5.07±1.75/7）、易用性（5.15±1.71/7）、启发式可用性（4.38±0.48/5）和强烈推荐（9.20±0.79/10）。处理时间因处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力而异。

Conclusion: Endoshare 提供了一个透明、用户友好的管道，用于标准化且保护隐私的手术视频管理。需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证，以确立其作为可部署替代专有系统的地位。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ATConv，通过将自注意力的动态路由和抑制机制融入传统卷积，实现了性能超越自注意力且高效的新型卷积算子，并在多个任务中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽表达能力强，但二次复杂度限制了其实际应用。传统卷积虽复杂度低，但性能与自注意力存在差距。本文旨在探索自注意力的优势原则，并将其融入卷积设计，以兼顾效率与性能。

Method: 作者重新审视了CNN的设计，揭示了自注意力机制优于卷积的两个关键原则：自适应路由和侧向抑制。基于这些原则，提出了ATConv，一种将自注意力的动态特性融入传统卷积的算子。

Result: ATConv在基础视觉任务中 consistently 优于多种自注意力机制。AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4% Top-1准确率，参数仅27M。在扩散生成任务中，替换自注意力为3×3 ATConv可提升图像生成质量（FID降低0.15）并加速采样。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Attentive Convolution（ATConv）的新型卷积算子，通过引入自适应路由和侧向抑制原则，显著提升了传统卷积的性能，使其在多个视觉任务中超越自注意力机制。基于ATConv构建的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到了84.4%的Top-1准确率，仅需27M参数。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在生成图像质量上有显著进步，但在生成像素级手绘草图（抽象表达的代表）方面仍存在挑战。

Method: 提出了StableSketcher框架，包括对变分自编码器进行微调以优化潜在解码，并集成基于视觉问答的强化学习奖励函数。

Conclusion: StableSketcher框架通过优化的潜在解码和新的奖励函数，显著提升了生成手绘草图的风格保真度和文本-图像对齐效果，并引入了首个实例级草图数据集SketchDUO。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 描述性标题在生物多模态基础模型中作为额外监督来源具有重要价值，能够有效连接生物图像与多模态基础模型。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome

small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Motivation: 现有的后处理方法未充分挖掘 logits 空间中的丰富信息，导致 OOD 检测效果受限。LogitGap 旨在通过更高效地利用 logit 空间信息来提升检测性能。

Method: LogitGap 通过分析最大 logit 与剩余 logit 之间的关系来增强 ID 和 OOD 样本的区分度，并进一步优化 logit 空间的子集以提高检测效果。

Result: LogitGap 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验中表现优异，在多种 OOD 检测场景和基准测试中均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap 提出了一种新颖的后处理 OOD 检测方法，通过显式利用 logits 空间中的信息，显著提升了 ID 和 OOD 样本的可分离性。理论和实验均验证了其有效性，并在多种场景和基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者的姿态估计对意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统6D姿态估计方法因自行车铰接结构的可变性而无法准确捕捉其实际姿态和行驶方向，因此需要更精细的8D姿态估计方法。

Result: 实验评估显示，该方法在8D姿态参数估计上表现优异，与基于刚性模板的6D姿态估计方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种针对铰接式自行车和骑行者的8D姿态估计方法，通过单张RGB图像不仅能估计自行车的3D平移和旋转，还能预测其转向把手和踏板的旋转角度，从而更精细地描述自行车的姿态状态和行驶方向。实验结果表明，该方法在准确度上具有竞争力。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Conclusion: 该方法在四个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，适用于封闭世界和开放世界设置。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Conclusion: IB-GAN在无监督解耦表示学习中表现出色，不仅在解耦分数上与最先进的β-VAEs竞争，还在生成样本的视觉质量和多样性上优于InfoGAN和β-VAEs。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

TL;DR: RAPO++ 是一个跨阶段提示优化框架，通过训练数据对齐、测试时迭代优化和 LLM 微调，显著提升文本到视频生成的提示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户提供的提示通常简短、无结构且与训练数据不匹配，限制了基于扩散的 T2V 模型的生成潜力。

Method: RAPO++ 是一个跨阶段提示优化框架，包括训练数据对齐的细化、测试时迭代缩放和大型语言模型（LLM）微调。

Result: RAPO++ 在五个最先进的 T2V 模型和五个基准测试中显著提升了语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性，大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAPO++ 作为一种模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为文本到视频（T2V）生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Conclusion: FlowCycle 通过目标感知的中间状态和循环一致过程，显著提升了文本到图像编辑的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统的胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性和准确性有限的问题，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的自监督学习框架CURL，结合空间和时间对比学习的双对比损失来学习稳健的运动表示，并引入了任务特定的采样策略。

Conclusion: CURL展示了自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中的潜力，为改进产前监测和临床决策铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: EditInfinity在PIE-Bench基准测试中表现出色，优于现有的基于扩散的基线模型，展示了其在高保真图像编辑和精确语义对齐方面的优势。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Motivation: 探讨LVLMs在长自由形式响应中幻觉增加的深层机制，而非仅归因于长度引起的错误。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的‘诱导-检测-抑制’框架，通过设计特定上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，并在实际解码中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 在所有基准测试中均取得了一致且显著的改进，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅验证了提出的‘诱导-检测-抑制’框架的有效性，更重要的是重新验证了关于上下文的假设，为深入探索LVLMs长响应中的幻觉问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task

large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks

performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation

agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we

For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new

Conclusion: COS3D在两种广泛使用的基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的性能，并展示了其在多种应用中的高潜力，如基于图像的3D分割、分层分割和机器人技术。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: ALICE-LRI 实现了无损的 LiDAR 范围图像生成，为高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: DualGround通过显式分离全局和局部语义的双分支架构，在视频语言对齐中实现了最先进的性能，证明了分离语义建模的有效性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于掩码的位置编码方案（MPE）和一个上下文增强模块（CEM），构成了EDGeo框架，显著提升了跨视角对象地理定位的性能，为相关研究提供了新的编码范式。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: CMC模型在四种数据集上表现优异，尤其在语义不一致场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Abstract: Technologies like smartphones have become an essential in our daily lives. It
has made accessible to everyone including visually impaired individuals. With
the use of smartphone cameras, image capturing and processing have become more
convenient. With the use of smartphones and machine learning, the life of
visually impaired can be made a little easier. Daily tasks such as handling
money without relying on someone can be troublesome for them. For that purpose
this paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist
visually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset
containing 30 classes of notes and coins, representing 3 types of currency: US
dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Bangladeshi taka (BDT). Our approach uses a
YOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional
layers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to enhance feature extraction and
detection accuracy. Our model has achieved a higher accuracy of 97.73%, recall
of 95.23%, f1-score of 95.85% and a mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5
(mAP50(B)) of 97.21\%. Using the voice feedback after the detection would help
the visually impaired to identify the currency. This paper aims to create a
practical and efficient currency detection system to empower visually impaired
individuals independent in handling money.

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态信息融合上较为粗糙，忽略视频片段中的冗余信息，导致检测效果受限。

Result: 在四个主要数据集上达到最先进性能，消融实验验证了冗余信息减少的有效性。

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过减少冗余信息并在视频异常检测中引入细粒度多模态特征，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Conclusion: KINN框架通过结合物理先验和轻量级架构，有效解决了CV-SAR图像识别中的表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析提供了高效、可解释且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: UI-Ins-32B和UI-Ins-7B在五个具有挑战性的基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，展示了新兴的推理能力，并在推理时选择性地组合和合成新的指令路径。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Method: 提出了HyperET训练范式，利用双曲空间中的动态半径调整和可学习矩阵（包括对角缩放矩阵、块对角矩阵和带状矩阵）来优化视觉表示与文本的对齐。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试中，HyperET显著提升了现有预训练和微调模型的性能，且参数增加极少。

Conclusion: HyperET通过动态调整双曲半径，有效解决了多模态大语言模型中视觉与文本模态在多层次粒度上的对齐问题，显著提升了模型性能，同时仅增加了不到1%的参数。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Motivation: 当前深度学习的点云几何压缩面临泛化能力不足的问题，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对OOD数据处理效率低。

Method: AnyPcc采用通用上下文模型捕获空间和通道分组的先验知识，并结合实例自适应微调策略（IAFT）处理OOD数据，通过微调少量网络权重并嵌入比特流中实现高效压缩。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过引入通用上下文模型和实例自适应微调策略，显著提升了点云几何压缩的泛化能力，并在15个多样化数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过最小化全精度扩散模型与其量化版本在多个去噪步骤中的输出差异，有效缓解了量化误差累积问题，并在标准基准测试中展示了其高效性和有效性。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Conclusion: PE-Field通过将位置编码从2D平面扩展到结构化的3D场，显著提升了DiTs在3D空间中的建模能力，并在单图像新视角合成和可控空间图像编辑任务中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

Conclusion: 论文提出的因果表示学习方法能够有效揭示食材和烹饪动作中的细微差异，并在单语和多语多元文化数据集上实现了显著的检索性能提升。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统静态知识蒸馏在处理肺癌图像时的不确定性和复杂性不足的问题。

Method: 采用动态模糊逻辑调整知识蒸馏权重，结合Vision Transformer（ViT-B32）和MobileNet，优化训练过程并引入图像融合技术（如Gamma校正和直方图均衡化）。

Result: 在LC25000组织病理图像（99.16%准确率）和IQOTH/NCCD CT扫描图像（99.54%准确率）上表现优异。

Conclusion: FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet模型通过动态模糊逻辑驱动的知识蒸馏，有效提升了肺癌分类的准确性和鲁棒性，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

TL;DR: Conan框架通过证据基础的多步视频推理和创新的训练策略，显著提升了视频推理的准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视频推理任务中存在未接地或幻觉结论的问题，而基于帧检索的方法在证据定位上仍不准确。为了解决这些问题，研究者提出了Conan框架。

Method: Conan框架通过识别上下文和证据帧、跨帧线索推理以及自适应决策来实现证据基础的多步视频推理。研究采用了多阶段渐进冷启动策略和Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR训练框架来联合增强多步视觉推理能力。

Result: Conan在六个多步推理基准测试中的平均准确率比基线模型高出10%以上，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Conan框架在视频推理任务中表现出色，不仅在多步推理基准测试中超越了基线模型Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct，还在长视频理解任务中展现了强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种模块化迁移学习方法改进人口统计属性推断（DAI），通过提高DAI可靠性优化公平性审计，并在性别和种族推断上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平性评估通常依赖于自动人口统计属性推断（DAI），而公平性审计的有效性取决于DAI过程的可靠性。理论动机表明，提高DAI可靠性可以减少偏见和降低公平性估计的方差。

Method: 提出了一种完全可重复的人口统计属性推断（DAI）流程，采用模块化迁移学习方法替代传统的端到端训练。该设计将预训练的人脸识别编码器与非线形分类头集成。

Conclusion: 本研究为公平性审计提供了可靠的人口统计推断基础，通过公开数据集元数据、完整代码库、预训练模型和评估工具包，促进了透明度和可重复性。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill通过双向蒸馏和对抗训练，提升单步扩散模型的个性化能力，同时优化教师模型生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单步扩散模型（1-SDP）在个性化新概念时因有限容量导致的分布捕获不足问题。

Method: 提出EchoDistill框架，结合端到端训练过程，教师模型（多步扩散）与学生模型（单步扩散）同步训练，通过双向概念蒸馏和对抗损失优化，实现概念传递与生成质量提升。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法。

Conclusion: EchoDistill框架通过双向概念蒸馏机制，不仅提升了学生模型对新概念的个性化能力，还改善了教师模型的生成质量，为T2I扩散模型的快速有效个性化建立了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

TL;DR: Metis-HOME 是一种混合专家框架，通过动态分配查询到不同专家分支，解决了多模态大型推理模型在效率与通用能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大型推理模型存在计算效率低下和通用理解能力受损的问题，需要一种既能高效处理复杂推理又能保持广泛理解能力的解决方案。

Method: 通过将原始密集模型结构化为两个不同的专家分支（思考分支和非思考分支），并利用轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询，实现了混合思维范式。

Result: Metis-HOME 不仅显著提升了复杂推理能力，还改善了模型的通用能力，逆转了其他推理专用模型中观察到的性能下降趋势。

Conclusion: Metis-HOME 提出了一种新的混合专家框架，有效解决了多模态大型推理模型在复杂推理与通用理解之间的权衡问题，为构建强大且多功能的多模态大语言模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

TL;DR: FiFa框架通过细粒度数据标注和模型设计，解决了现有可解释性深度伪造分析方法的不足，实现了更可靠的伪造解释和视觉证据连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在细粒度感知上存在不足，数据标注不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法支持文本伪造解释与视觉伪影证据的连接输出，也无法支持任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 提出了Facial Image Concept Tree（FICT）用于细粒度区域划分，并开发了FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程。基于此，设计了Artifact-Grounding Explanation（AGE）任务，并构建了多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上超越强基线，并在现有XDFA数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度的数据标注和模型构建，显著提升了可解释性深度伪造分析的性能，并在AGE任务和现有XDFA数据集上达到了SOTA水平。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在严重或空间变化模糊的情况下优于端到端去模糊网络。

Conclusion: 该方法在合成和真实数据集上均实现了最先进的性能，特别是在处理严重或空间变化模糊时表现优异。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

TL;DR: ACamera-Net是一种轻量级、场景自适应的相机参数调整网络，通过直接预测RAW输入的最佳曝光和白平衡，显著提升复杂光照条件下的图像质量，且无需额外增强模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级相机系统在复杂光照条件下（如低光、高动态范围、背光及空间色温变化）难以保持稳定的图像质量，导致曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，影响下游视觉任务性能。

Method: ACamera-Net包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure用于估计ISO以缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color用于预测相关色温和增益因子以改善色彩一致性。

Result: 实验表明，ACamera-Net在图像质量和感知输出稳定性上均优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net通过轻量级和场景自适应的相机参数调整网络，显著提升了复杂光照条件下的图像质量，且无需依赖额外的图像增强模块。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Motivation: 现有的视频推理模型缺乏对关键证据时空定位的能力，而 Open-o3 Video 旨在通过整合时空证据和推理追踪来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种非代理框架 Open-o3 Video，整合了显式的时空证据到视频推理中，并通过精心设计的强化学习策略（特别设计的奖励机制）来优化答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在 V-STAR 基准测试中，Open-o3 Video 将 mAM 和 mLGM 分别提升了 14.4% 和 24.2%，并在多个视频理解基准测试中表现出持续改进。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video 在视频推理任务中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了多项基准测试的准确率，并提供了有价值的推理追踪信号，增强了答案的可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的相似性原型框架有效提升了跨模态分割的性能，解决了域适应问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Method: SeViCES框架包含两个关键组件：语义-视觉共识帧选择模块（SVCFS）和答案共识细化模块（ACR）。SVCFS通过时间感知的语义分支和聚类引导的视觉分支选择帧；ACR通过融合证据和约束答案空间解决不一致性。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SeViCES框架通过语义-视觉共识证据选择，显著提升了长视频理解的准确性和鲁棒性，证明了共识驱动证据选择对视频大语言模型的重要性。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型 (VLM) 在处理信息密集图像时难以精确定位关键线索并进行多跳推理，因此需要一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Method: SV 框架包括草案阶段和裁决阶段：草案阶段由小型 VLM 生成多样化的定位候选路径；裁决阶段由大型 VLM 合成这些路径生成最终答案，并引入共识专家选择机制提高效率和准确性。

Result: SV 在 InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro 和 HR-Bench 4K 等挑战性基准测试中表现优异，实现了错误纠正和成本效益。

Conclusion: Speculative Verdict (SV) 框架通过结合多个轻量级草案专家与大型裁决模型，有效解决了信息密集图像中的多跳推理和精确定位问题，实现了错误纠正和成本效益。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

TL;DR: BTB3D通过改进的3D标记化方法，显著提升了3D医学成像中的视觉语言建模性能，尤其在报告生成和文本到CT合成任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在高分辨率、长序列体积上表现不佳，如对比预训练常导致视觉编码器与临床语言不匹配，切片标记化模糊精细解剖结构。

Method: BTB3D（Better Tokens for Better 3D），一种因果卷积编码器-解码器，统一了2D和3D训练和推理，同时生成紧凑的频率感知体积标记。通过三阶段训练课程：（i）局部重建，（ii）重叠窗口平铺，（iii）长上下文解码器细化。

Result: BTB3D在报告生成任务中提升BLEU分数和临床F1 40%，在文本到CT合成任务中降低FID 75%和FVD一半，生成解剖学一致的512*512*241体积。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化对于3D医学成像中的可扩展视觉语言建模至关重要，而非仅依赖更大的语言模型。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

Method: 为了解决超高清文本到图像生成的两大挑战，作者提出了UltraHR-100K数据集和频率感知的后训练方法，包括细节导向的时间步采样（DOTS）和软加权频率正则化（SWFR）。

Result: 在UltraHR-eval4K基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升了超高清图像生成的细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 本文提出的UltraHR-100K数据集和频率感知的后训练方法显著提升了超高清文本到图像生成的细节质量和整体保真度。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

TL;DR: LDDBM是一种通用模态转换框架，通过共享潜在空间和对比对齐损失，解决了跨模态翻译的挑战，并在多种任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在单模态领域（如图像和音频）表现出色，但将其能力扩展到跨模态翻译（MT）仍是一个开放挑战。现有方法通常依赖限制性假设，限制了其通用性和理论基础。

Method: 提出了Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM)，通过在共享潜在空间中操作，学习任意模态之间的桥梁，无需对齐维度。引入了对比对齐损失以增强配对样本的语义一致性，并设计了适用于潜在空间噪声预测的领域无关编码器-解码器架构。

Result: LDDBM在多种MT任务中表现优异，包括多视角到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视角场景合成。

Conclusion: LDDBM框架在多种模态转换任务中表现出色，为通用模态转换建立了新的强基线。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Motivation: 现有方法在多比特量化网络中需要重复全数据集更新和额外微调阶段，导致训练负担大。

Method: 提出了两种技术：权重偏差校正和位级核心集采样策略，以减少训练开销。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K等数据集上，方法减少了高达7.88倍的训练时间，同时保持或提升了模型精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过权重偏差校正和位级核心集采样策略，显著减少了训练开销，同时保持了模型性能，在多个数据集和架构上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation
suite to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法仅关注重要性，忽视了多模态KV缓存中特有的语义冗余模式，导致语义覆盖不足。

Method: MixKV通过分析注意力头间的语义冗余模式，选择性地平衡多样性和重要性来压缩KV对。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下（预算=64），MixKV平均提升基线方法5.1%，在GUI grounding任务中提升SnapKV和AdaKV分别8.0%和9.0%。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性优化了KV缓存压缩，显著提升了多模态理解任务的性能，并保持了推理效率，同时可无缝扩展到LLMs。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

Conclusion: AutoScape显著提升了长时驾驶场景生成的几何一致性和视觉质量，FID和FVD分数分别比现有最优方法提高了48.6%和43.0%。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Motivation: 尽管扩散变换器模型能够生成高保真度的图像，但在超高分辨率下训练成本极高，因为自注意力机制与图像令牌数量的平方成比例。DyPE旨在解决这一问题，使预训练模型能够高效生成超高分辨率图像。

Method: DyPE通过动态调整模型在扩散过程中的位置编码，使其频谱与生成过程的当前阶段相匹配，从而在不增加采样成本的情况下生成远超训练分辨率（如1600万像素）的图像。

Conclusion: DyPE是一种无需训练的新方法，能够显著提升预训练扩散变换器在超高分辨率图像生成中的性能，且在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Result: α-Flow在ImageNet-1K 256x256数据集上表现优于MeanFlow，其中最大的α-Flow-XL/2+模型取得了1-NFE FID 2.58和2-NFE FID 2.15的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: MeanFlow的优化目标自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两部分，这两部分存在负相关，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。通过引入α-Flow，采用从轨迹流匹配到MeanFlow的平滑过渡策略，成功解决了优化冲突，并在ImageNet-1K 256x256数据集上取得了优于MeanFlow的性能。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Result: Cupid在实验中表现优异，PSNR提升超过3 dB，Chamfer Distance减少超过10%，同时在姿态估计和视觉保真度上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Cupid在3D重建领域表现出色，显著提升了PSNR和Chamfer Distance，同时在姿态估计和视觉保真度上优于现有方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Motivation: 现有研究常低估雷达的作用，而该论文旨在充分利用雷达提供精确距离/深度信息的能力，简化雷达与摄像头检测结果的整合。

Method: 利用雷达和摄像头数据的共同特征进行在线校准，结合特征匹配和类别一致性检查来提升传感器关联准确性。

Result: 实验证明该框架能有效简化雷达-摄像头映射过程并提高跟踪精度，适用于受控环境和实际交通场景。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的雷达-摄像头融合多目标跟踪框架通过在线校准和特征匹配显著提升了跟踪效率和精度，减少了人工干预。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGenSeg是一种基于图像生成的分割框架，通过自回归生成和并行视觉令牌预测，显著提升MLLM的分割性能和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖离散表示或语义提示，无法捕捉细粒度视觉细节的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于自回归生成的分割框架（ARGenSeg），利用MLLM输出视觉令牌，并通过通用的VQ-VAE将其解码为图像，实现像素级理解。采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成视觉令牌以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越现有最先进方法，并显著提升推理速度。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg通过基于图像生成的分割框架，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在图像分割任务中的性能，同时保持了强大的理解能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种纯Transformer模型用于视频预测，显著延长物理准确预测时间，保持视频质量，并展示了模型的可解释性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大型语言模型性能和可扩展性的启发，研究旨在探索Transformer在视频预测中的应用，特别是针对现有视频生成方法在物理模拟时间因果建模上的不足。

Method: 采用纯Transformer模型，通过连续像素空间表示进行视频预测，比较了不同的时空自注意力布局，并通过物理对象跟踪指标和无监督训练在物理模拟数据集上进行了验证。

Result: 与现有潜在空间方法相比，该方法将物理准确预测的时间范围延长了50%，同时在常见视频质量指标上保持了可比性能。此外，通过可解释性实验，发现网络区域能够泛化到分布外模拟参数的估计。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种简单而有效的纯Transformer模型，用于自回归视频预测，显著延长了物理准确预测的时间范围，并保持了视频质量指标的竞争力，为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个参数高效且可解释的平台。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph 是一种物理引导的自监督HSI-MSI融合框架，通过解混瓶颈设计提升性能，速度快且鲁棒性强，尤其在单波段MSI时表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱传感器空间分辨率低，导致模糊边界和混合像素效应。多光谱或RGB等伴生传感器提供高分辨率空间细节，驱动了HSI-MSI融合的需求。现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且在MSI波段极少时表现不佳。

Method: SpectraMorph 采用解混瓶颈设计，从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，并通过多层感知机从MSI预测类似丰度的图，最后通过线性混合重建光谱。

Result: SpectraMorph 在合成和真实数据集上均优于当前最先进的无监督/自监督基线，并与监督基线竞争。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph 通过物理引导的自监督框架，在保持高鲁棒性和可解释性的同时，显著提升了高光谱图像的超分辨率性能，甚至在单波段MSI情况下仍表现优异。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制提升控制与保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型在空间组合控制和多主体扩展方面存在不足，需要更灵活的交互框架。

Method: 提出了分层画布表示和锁定机制，利用位置嵌入和互补数据采样策略，无需架构更改即可实现灵活控制。

Result: 实验证明，LayerComposer在多主体个性化图像生成中实现了优越的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过引入分层画布和锁定机制，显著提升了多主体个性化图像生成的空间控制和身份保持能力，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine模型通过创新的注意力机制全局生成连贯的多镜头叙事，实现了从片段合成到自动化电影制作的突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到视频模型在生成连贯多镜头叙事方面的不足，即“叙事鸿沟”。

Method: 采用Window Cross-Attention机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，并通过Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention模式（镜头内密集、镜头间稀疏）确保高效生成。

Result: HoloCine在叙事连贯性上达到新高度，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆以及对电影技术的直观理解。

Conclusion: HoloCine通过全局一致的场景生成和创新的注意力机制，实现了从片段合成到自动化电影制作的关键转变，为端到端的电影创作铺平了道路。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出一种基于矩阵乘积态的量子启发算法，用于高效解决QUBO问题，展示了在数独和MaxCut问题上的优异表现和工业应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出并评估一种量子启发算法，用于解决二次无约束二进制优化（QUBO）问题，这些问题与寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态数学等价。

Method: 算法使用矩阵乘积态（MPS）紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加，并通过离散驱动调度引导MPS向基态发展。采用密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG）方法迭代更新MPS，最小化系统能量。

Result: 算法在中间级数独谜题和MaxCut问题上表现出色，成功解决了涉及超过200个伊辛自旋和251个节点、3,265条边的实例。

Conclusion: 该算法在多种QUBO实例中可靠地识别全局最小值，展示了其可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业规模QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前能源领域的人工智能系统缺乏标准化框架来验证其推理的正确性，现有验证方法侧重于预测准确性或计算效率，而忽略了分析结论的逻辑完整性。

Method: 研究引入了ARB框架，整合了五个子指标（准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度），并在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下评估了四种前沿模型（GPT-4/5、Claude 4.5 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Llama 3 70B）的性能。

Result: 结果显示，推理可靠性可以被客观测量。GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet表现一致且符合政策要求（分析可靠性指数大于90），Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等稳定，Llama 3 70B未达到专业阈值。统计验证证实这些差异显著且可重复。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准（ARB），为能源领域的人工智能系统提供了首个定量评估因果、概率和政策驱动推理的方法，为全球能源转型中的可信透明分析应用建立了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的基于LLM的网页代理框架，通过其精细化的树状探索和状态回放机制，显著提升了任务成功率和执行效率。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art

Method: 提出将CoT建模为基于规则的随机过程，并引入逻辑紧密度度量。构建DAG-MATH CoT格式的基准，用于评估LLMs的推理能力。

Result: 分析揭示了代表性LLM家族在推理忠诚度上的显著差异，即使PASS@k相似。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式的CoT和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLMs的推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available

TL;DR: RELATE是一种与模式无关的图特征编码器，通过共享模态特定编码器和交叉注意力模块，显著减少参数数量并保持性能，支持多数据集预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络依赖于特定模式的特性编码器，需要为每种节点类型和特征列设计单独的模块，这限制了可扩展性和参数共享。

Method: RELATE采用共享的模态特定编码器处理分类、数值、文本和时间属性，然后通过类似Perceiver的交叉注意力模块将特征聚合为固定大小的、排列不变的节点表示。

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE在ReLGNN和HGT上的性能接近特定模式编码器的3%以内，同时减少了高达5倍的参数数量。

Conclusion: RELATE的设计支持不同模式的关系图数据，并为通用GNN的多数据集预训练铺平了道路，为关系图数据的基础模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术在个性化学习中的潜力，特别是通过领导力人格特质预测学术成功。

Method: 研究采用了探索性数据分析和相关性分析，通过皮尔逊相关系数进行特征选择，并调优了七种机器学习算法（SVM、LR、KNN、DT、GB、RF、XGBoost和LightGBM）。

Result: 随机森林分类器（RF）表现最佳，包含17个人格特质特征和领导力标记特征的模型准确率为87.50%，不包含该特征的模型准确率为85.71%。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合领导力人格特质和机器学习模型，为个性化学习提供了新的方法，能够早期识别学生的优劣势并选择最适合的学习策略。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

TL;DR: 利用LLM在普通文本中隐藏秘密信息，展示了文本与作者意图的脱钩，对AI安全提出挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用LLM在看似普通的文本中隐藏秘密信息，从而揭示文本与作者意图的脱钩现象。

Method: 提出了一种简单高效的协议，利用大型语言模型（LLM）将有意义的信息隐藏在不同但连贯的文本中。

Result: 即使是8亿参数的开放源码LLM也能在笔记本电脑上快速编码和解码长文本。

Conclusion: 该协议的存在展示了文本与作者意图的彻底脱钩，进一步削弱了对书面通信的信任。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Motivation: 为了解决非专家用户在数字资产交易异常检测中的需求，HCLA旨在提供一种直观、可解释且交互式的解决方案。

Method: HCLA是一个多角色系统，结合了解析、检测和解释功能，通过自然语言交互和结构化分析实现异常检测。系统采用开源Web UI，将用户意图转化为经典检测器（XGBoost）的模式，并提供基于特征的叙述性解释。

Conclusion: HCLA通过将人类纳入循环设计，提高了金融取证中的透明度和信任度。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,

questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial

TL;DR: 论文挑战了AI能显著降低法律实践成本的乐观假设，提出了验证-价值悖论模型，指出AI使用的净价值往往可以忽略不计，并强调了律师核心职责与AI局限性之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对AI在法律实践中应用的乐观假设忽视了律师管理AI风险的能力，以及AI的局限性（如脱离现实、缺乏透明性）与律师核心职责（如诚实、正直）之间的矛盾。

Method: 论文通过分析澳大利亚等地的案例，提出了验证-价值悖论模型，以更全面地反映AI在法律实践中的使用特征。

Result: 验证-价值悖论表明，AI使用带来的效率提升会被手动验证的需求抵消，导致净价值往往可以忽略不计。论文还提出了对法律实践和法律教育的具体影响。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的范式来评估AI在法律实践中的使用，强调了律师的核心职责（如诚实、正直）与AI的局限性（如脱离现实、缺乏透明性）之间的矛盾。验证-价值悖论表明，AI使用的净价值对律师来说往往可以忽略不计，并提出了对法律实践和法律教育的影响。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审计方法存在集中化、不透明和难以扩展的问题，导致高风险领域部署专有模型时存在安全隐患。

Method: 提出TRUST框架，包括共识机制、分层DAG分解、区块链账本和隐私保护分段技术。

Result: 实验表明TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，并在对抗性审计中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRUST框架通过去中心化审计机制，为大型语言模型的透明、安全部署提供了可行路径，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs从模仿到身份巩固的转变，认为这是实现AGI的关键步骤，并通过实验展示了不同规模模型的巩固效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解大型语言模型（LLMs）从开放模仿到身份巩固的转变过程，以及这一过程对实现人工通用智能（AGI）的影响。

Method: 通过类比人类发展，论文形式化了身份巩固阶段，并将其与学习动态中的已知现象联系起来。提出了操作性的指标来检测这一阶段的开始，并通过实验验证了不同规模模型的行为变化。

Result: 实验结果显示，行为巩固在不同规模的模型中表现各异：小型模型表现出性能权衡，中型模型几乎无成本地采纳，而大型量化模型则出现短暂的不稳定性。

Conclusion: 论文提出身份巩固阶段是通往AGI的关键步骤，它不仅影响模型的可靠性，还是安全控制的重要节点。身份可以人为设计以提高可靠性，但也可能在模型扩展过程中自发形成，导致目标和行为的不可预测性增强。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2048游戏结合了策略性玩法与随机性，是研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应的理想场景。论文旨在探索AI在动态环境中的优化方法。

Method: 研究采用了两种系统：一种是双智能体元提示系统，由'思考者'大型语言模型（LLM）优化'执行者'LLM的策略；另一种是基于有限蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）值函数优化的单智能体系统，并尝试了回滚功能以避免性能下降。

Result: 单智能体系统表现出显著提升，平均每周期增加473.2分，且训练周期呈现明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。而双智能体系统改进有限，凸显了元提示的局限性。

Conclusion: 论文展示了进化优化技术在非确定性环境中提升AI性能的潜力，单智能体系统表现显著优于双智能体系统，后者揭示了元提示的固有局限性。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型在个体化认知模拟中的表现，发现结合概念和语言特征最有效，但模型在模仿语言风格方面优于叙事结构，揭示了其在深层认知模拟中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在模仿表面人类行为（如角色扮演）方面表现令人信服，但它们模拟更深层次个体化认知过程的能力仍知之甚少。为了填补这一空白，本研究旨在评估不同认知表征方法在个体化认知模拟（ICS）中的效果。

Method: 研究引入了一个新颖的任务，评估ICS中的不同认知表征方法。构建了一个来自近期出版小说（晚于测试LLMs发布日期的数据集），并提出了一个11条件的认知评估框架，用于在作者风格模仿背景下对七个现成的LLMs进行基准测试。测试了不同的认知表征，如语言特征、概念映射和基于个人档案的信息。

Result: 结果显示，结合概念和语言特征在ICS中特别有效，优于基于静态个人档案的线索。LLMs在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，突显了它们在更深层次认知模拟中的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，结合概念和语言特征在个体化认知模拟（ICS）中特别有效，优于基于静态个人档案的线索。此外，大型语言模型（LLMs）在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，突显了它们在更深层次认知模拟中的局限性。这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更个性化和与人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用大型语言模型生成PDDL抽象域的方法，实验显示GPT-4o在动作抽象上表现良好，但在状态变量抽象上存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态领域的抽象生成对智能体的规划、推理和解释能力至关重要，但目前仍是一个挑战。

Method: 使用PDDL建模具体行为，并通过大型语言模型（如GPT-4o）进行上下文学习，生成抽象的PDDL域和问题实例。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4o在简单场景中能有效生成规划领域抽象，但在状态变量抽象上表现较弱。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够在一定程度上生成有用的规划领域抽象，尤其是在简单场景中，但在处理相关状态变量（fluents）时表现不如动作抽象。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型仅建模位置序列或将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用POI提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 提出STaBERT模型，结合POI嵌入和派生时间描述符，构建统一的语义丰富移动性表示。

Result: 单城市预测的GEO-BLEU得分从0.34提升至0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升至0.56。

Conclusion: STaBERT通过整合POI和时间信息，显著提升了人类移动预测的准确性，证明了语义和时间信息在移动性建模中的重要性。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接利用VLM探索环境并回答问题，缺乏显式思考和规划，导致推理能力受限、探索效率低下和响应不准确。

Method: 提出ToolEQA代理，结合外部工具和多步推理，设计自动生成EQA任务的数据生成流程，并收集EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen上，ToolEQA比基线方法成功率提升9.2~20.2%，并在其他数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过整合外部工具和多步推理，显著提高了EQA任务的准确性和效率，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗领域有巨大潜力，但实际应用中因训练数据的质量和公平性问题而受限。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于西班牙国家R&D计划中的AI4HealthyAging项目，识别了临床数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型。

Result: 识别了历史、代表性、测量等多种偏见，涉及性别、年龄、居住环境、社会经济地位等变量。

Conclusion: 本文提出了改善临床问题设计和数据收集的实用建议，以提高AI系统的公平性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the

*Haonan Bian*

TL;DR: 该综述系统回顾了LLM如何革新知识图谱构建，分析了基于模式和无模式的两种范式，并展望了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型如何改变知识图谱构建的经典三层流程（本体工程、知识抽取和知识融合），从而推动知识系统的革新。

Method: 回顾传统知识图谱方法，并系统分析LLM驱动的知识图谱构建方法，包括基于模式和无模式的两种范式。

Result: 总结了LLM驱动的知识图谱构建的代表性框架、技术机制及其局限性，并展望了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 该综述旨在阐明大语言模型（LLMs）与知识图谱（KGs）之间的动态交互，通过结合符号化知识工程与神经语义理解，推动自适应、可解释和智能知识系统的发展。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

TL;DR: IKnow是一个无需外部资源的持续适应框架，通过创新的自监督目标保持指令跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖原始基础模型或外部领域特定数据库的局限性，适应无法获取基础模型权重或可靠外部语料库的现实场景。

Method: IKnow框架在指令-响应对话格式中制定了新的自监督目标，利用文本中嵌入的领域知识进行深层语义编码。

Result: IKnow能够在不需要外部资源的情况下，持续适应新领域，同时保持指令跟随能力和语义表示。

Conclusion: IKnow框架通过创新的自监督目标，成功地在不需要外部资源的情况下，持续适应新领域，同时保持了模型的指令跟随能力和语义表示。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于描述逻辑推理器的概念学习方法对不一致和错误数据缺乏鲁棒性，难以应用于现实知识库。

Method: EBR依赖嵌入技术来近似符号推理器的结果，仅需检索原子概念和存在限制的实例即可近似描述逻辑$\mathcal{SHOIQ}$中任何概念的实例集。

Result: 实验表明，EBR在缺失和错误数据情况下表现优于现有推理器。

Conclusion: EBR作为一种新型神经推理器，通过嵌入技术近似符号推理器的结果，展现出对缺失和错误数据的鲁棒性，优于现有推理器。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注纯实体级别对齐，缺乏可解释性且需要训练数据，FLORA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FLORA通过模糊逻辑迭代地实现实体和关系的整体对齐，提供可解释的结果，并确保算法的收敛性。

Result: FLORA在主要基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，支持悬空实体处理，并提供了可解释的对齐过程。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种无需训练数据、基于模糊逻辑的知识图谱对齐方法，具有可解释性、收敛性，并能处理悬空实体，在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨公众对AI的强烈意见如何被政策制定者忽视，以及这种忽视如何影响AI治理的信任和合法性。

Method: 通过景观分析比较了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家在AI风险和政策的公众反馈机制及其对治理的影响。

Result: 研究发现，三个国家的公众参与率均低于人口的1%，且政策制定者对反馈的响应有限，未能建立有效的对话机制。

Conclusion: 当前AI治理的参与式方法未能有效建立信任或合法性，因为政策制定者未能充分听取或回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的求解器无法在近实时条件下解决大规模系统的混合整数非线性问题，而现有的机器学习方法在泛化到未见过的拓扑、不同运行条件和系统方面存在局限性。

Method: 论文采用了一种异构边缘感知的消息传递神经网络（GNN）来预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选NTO解决方案，并考虑了线性化的交流潮流（AC PF）。

Result: 案例研究表明，该方法实现了高达4个数量级的加速，能够在1分钟内提供交流可行的解决方案，并在GOC 2000总线系统上实现了2.3%的最优性差距。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的方法，用于加速大规模系统的网络拓扑优化（NTO），实现了在近实时条件下的性能提升和跨系统泛化能力。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

Method: 引入了因果逐步评估（CaSE）方法，通过仅使用前文上下文评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差，并在专家标注的基准测试MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH上验证其可靠性。

Result: 实验证明，使用CaSE评估的相关性和连贯性数据训练模型，能够直接提升最终任务的表现。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了因果逐步评估（CaSE）方法，通过细粒度评估推理过程的相关性和连贯性，显著提升了大型语言模型的最终任务表现，为模型的改进提供了可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

Motivation: 尽管随机游走中心性能够捕捉丰富的图结构信息并具有广泛应用，但现有方法在大型网络中的计算仍不切实际。

Method: 提出了两种算法：一种利用近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计，另一种通过采样有根生成树。

Result: 在包括超过1000万节点的大型真实网络上的广泛实验表明，所提算法具有高效性和良好的近似质量。

Conclusion: 本文提出了两种可扩展的算法，用于高效计算大型网络中的随机游走中心性，实验证明它们在近线性时间内运行并提供强近似保证。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

Result: EcomEval覆盖六个类别和37个任务（包括8个多模态任务），源自真实的客户查询和交易日志，并支持七种语言。

Conclusion: EcomEval是一个全面的多语言和多模态基准测试，用于评估电子商务中的大型语言模型，填补了现有评估工具的不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Conclusion: 该论文提出Fluidity Index（FI）作为量化模型在动态扩展环境中适应性的指标，强调真正超级智能模型应具备至少二阶适应性，以实现自我维持的计算和最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大型语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标准、手动标注和缓慢的成对判断，且自动化方法多基于图结构代理，无法准确反映高质量推理的本质。

Method: 采用拓扑数据分析方法，通过捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构，实现了标签高效、自动化的评估。

Result: 实证研究表明，拓扑特征在评估推理质量时具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效的推理更适用于高维几何结构而非纯关系图。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于拓扑数据分析（TDA）的评估框架，能够高效、自动化地评估大型语言模型的推理轨迹质量，为未来的强化学习算法提供了实用的信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

Conclusion: Graph-RFT通过两阶段的强化微调框架，结合链式思维微调和计划检索引导的强化学习过程，有效解决了KGQA中知识覆盖不足和推理连贯性问题，实现了在不完整知识条件下的自主规划和自适应检索调度。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

Motivation: 现有AGI定义（如算术平均）假设补偿性，即某些领域的卓越能力可以抵消其他领域的不足，但真正的通用智能应反映跨所有关键领域的平衡能力。

Method: 通过广义均值在补偿性指数连续体上的积分，构建了AUC（曲线下面积）来量化AGI的鲁棒性，涵盖了算术、几何和调和均值。

proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

### [124] [E-Test: E'er-Improving Test Suites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19860)
*Ketai Qiu,Luca Di Grazia,Leonardo Mariani,Mauro Pezzè*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: E-Test通过LLMs识别测试套件未覆盖的执行场景并生成新测试用例，显著提升测试套件质量，F1-score达0.55。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试套件存在不完善的问题，难以覆盖所有执行场景，尤其是在长期维护大型测试套件时，手动补充测试用例极具挑战性。

Method: E-Test利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从大量场景中识别当前测试套件未覆盖的执行场景，并生成新的测试用例来增强测试套件。

Result: 在1,975个场景的数据集上，E-Test的F1-score达到0.55，显著优于现有方法（最高0.34）和普通LLMs（最高0.39）。

Conclusion: E-Test显著提高了测试套件的质量，通过有效识别和生成未测试的执行场景，减少了维护测试套件所需的手动工作量。

Abstract: Test suites are inherently imperfect, and testers can always enrich a suite
with new test cases that improve its quality and, consequently, the reliability
of the target software system. However, finding test cases that explore
execution scenarios beyond the scope of an existing suite can be extremely
challenging and labor-intensive, particularly when managing large test suites
over extended periods.
  In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that reduces the gap between
the execution space explored with a test suite and the executions experienced
after testing by augmenting the test suite with test cases that explore
execution scenarios that emerge in production. E-Test (i) identifies executions
that have not yet been tested from large sets of scenarios, such as those
monitored during intensive production usage, and (ii) generates new test cases
that enhance the test suite. E-Test leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to
pinpoint scenarios that the current test suite does not adequately cover, and
augments the suite with test cases that execute these scenarios.
  Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,975 scenarios, collected from highly-starred
open-source Java projects already in production and Defects4J, demonstrates
that E-Test retrieves not-yet-tested execution scenarios significantly better
than state-of-the-art approaches. While existing regression testing and field
testing approaches for this task achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.34, and
vanilla LLMs achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.39, E-Test reaches 0.55. These
results highlight the impact of E-Test in enhancing test suites by effectively
targeting not-yet-tested execution scenarios and reducing manual effort
required for maintaining test suites.

TL;DR: 论文提出 Spreadsheet Operations Documentation (SOD) 任务，通过 LLMs 将电子表格操作代码转换为自然语言，提升文档化能力，并验证了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格在商业、会计和金融领域广泛应用，但缺乏系统化的文档方法阻碍了自动化、协作和知识转移，导致关键机构知识流失的风险。

Method: 提出了一个包含 111 个电子表格操作代码片段及其对应自然语言摘要的基准，并评估了五种 LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、LLaMA-3.3-70B、Mixtral-8x7B 和 Gemma2-9B）在 BLEU、GLEU、ROUGE-L 和 METEOR 指标上的表现。

Result: 研究发现 LLMs 能够生成准确的电子表格文档，证明 SOD 是可行的。

Conclusion: LLMs 能够生成准确的电子表格文档，使 SOD 成为提升电子表格可重复性、可维护性和协作工作流程的可行前提步骤，但仍存在需解决的挑战。

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

Motivation: 现有方法在大规模应用级软件代码生成中表现不足，无法确保项目代码的合理组织结构，且难以维护代码生成过程。

Method: 提出了一种名为KGACG的知识引导应用级代码生成框架，通过Code Organization & Planning Agent (COPA)、Coding Agent (CA)和Testing Agent (TA)的协作闭环，结合反馈机制，将软件需求规范和架构设计文档转化为可执行代码。

Result: 通过Java Tank Battle游戏案例研究展示了KGACG中智能体的协作过程，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: KGACG框架通过多智能体协作和反馈机制，致力于提升应用级软件开发的自动化水平，尽管在实现过程中仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Automated code generation driven by Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) has
enhanced development efficiency, yet generating complex application-level
software code remains challenging. Multi-agent frameworks show potential, but
existing methods perform inadequately in large-scale application-level software
code generation, failing to ensure reasonable orga- nizational structures of
project code and making it difficult to maintain the code generation process.
To address this, this paper envisions a Knowledge-Guided Application-Level Code
Generation framework named KGACG, which aims to trans- form software
requirements specification and architectural design document into executable
code through a collaborative closed- loop of the Code Organization & Planning
Agent (COPA), Coding Agent (CA), and Testing Agent (TA), combined with a
feedback mechanism. We demonstrate the collaborative process of the agents in
KGACG in a Java Tank Battle game case study while facing challenges. KGACG is
dedicated to advancing the automation of application-level software
development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的合成bug生成方法，通过让SWE Agents在代码中引入功能来产生更真实的bug，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量和多样化的bug对于训练下一代基于语言模型的软件工程代理至关重要。当前方法生成的bug往往不真实，无法反映实际的开发过程。

Method: 该方法指导软件工程代理（SWE Agents）在代码库中引入新功能，可能导致测试失败，从而产生bug。与以往故意生成bug的方法不同，此方法更真实地反映了开发过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的bug在监督微调中表现更优，仅需一半的训练数据即可超越其他bug数据集2%的性能。训练后的模型在SWE-bench上达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过引入一种新颖的合成生成方法，成功生成了更接近人类编辑模式的高质量、多样化的bug，显著提升了语言模型在软件工程任务中的表现。

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model
based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for
synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE
Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may
unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce
an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by
introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect
realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate
that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found
in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning,
outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k
bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug
datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench
Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on
SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究突变器应用顺序对灰盒模糊测试效果的影响，假设优化顺序可提高效率。

Method: 提出MuoFuzz，通过学习突变序列的条件概率并采用随机游走生成序列，优化突变顺序。

Result: MuoFuzz在FuzzBench和MAGMA基准测试中实现了最高的代码覆盖率，并发现了其他工具遗漏的漏洞。

Conclusion: MuoFuzz通过学习和选择最有前景的突变序列，显著提高了灰盒模糊测试的效果，超越了AFL++和MOPT。

Abstract: A greybox fuzzer is an automated software testing tool that generates new
test inputs by applying randomly chosen mutators (e.g., flipping a bit or
deleting a block of bytes) to a seed input in random order and adds all
coverage-increasing inputs to the corpus of seeds. We hypothesize that the
order in which mutators are applied to a seed input has an impact on the
effectiveness of greybox fuzzers. In our experiments, we fit a linear model to
a dataset that contains the effectiveness of all possible mutator pairs and
indeed observe the conjectured interaction effect. This points us to more
efficient fuzzing by choosing the most promising mutator sequence with a higher
likelihood. We propose MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that learns and chooses the
most promising mutator sequences. MuoFuzz learns the conditional probability
that the next mutator will yield an interesting input, given the previously
selected mutator. Then, it samples from the learned probability using a random
walk to generate mutator sequences. We compare the performance of MuoFuzz to
AFL++, which uses a fixed selection probability, and MOPT, which optimizes the
selection probability of each mutator in isolation. Experimental results on the
FuzzBench and MAGMA benchmarks show that MuoFuzz achieves the highest code
coverage and finds four bugs missed by AFL++ and one missed by both AFL++ and
MOPT.

TL;DR: FAIGMOE是首个针对GenAI在中型组织和大型企业中采纳的综合性框架，分四阶段解决资源、复杂性和协调等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术采纳框架缺乏针对GenAI在不同规模组织中实施的 specificity，导致采纳文献中的关键空白。

Method: 结合技术采纳理论、组织变革管理和创新扩散视角，分为四个互连阶段：战略评估、规划与用例开发、实施与集成、运营与优化。

Result: 提出了FAIGMOE框架，涵盖战略评估到运营优化的全流程，并融入GenAI特有考量（如提示工程、模型编排等）。

Conclusion: FAIGMOE框架为中型组织和大型企业提供了首个全面解决GenAI采用问题的概念框架，包含可操作的协议和工具，需未来研究进行实证验证。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents transformative
opportunities for organizations, yet both midsize organizations and larger
enterprises face distinctive adoption challenges. Midsize organizations
encounter resource constraints and limited AI expertise, while enterprises
struggle with organizational complexity and coordination challenges. Existing
technology adoption frameworks, including TAM (Technology Acceptance Model),
TOE (Technology Organization Environment), and DOI (Diffusion of Innovations)
theory, lack the specificity required for GenAI implementation across these
diverse contexts, creating a critical gap in adoption literature. This paper
introduces FAIGMOE (Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI
in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises), a conceptual framework addressing
the unique needs of both organizational types. FAIGMOE synthesizes technology
adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion
perspectives into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning
and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and
Operationalization and Optimization. Each phase provides scalable guidance on
readiness assessment, strategic alignment, risk governance, technical
architecture, and change management adaptable to organizational scale and
complexity. The framework incorporates GenAI specific considerations including
prompt engineering, model orchestration, and hallucination management that
distinguish it from generic technology adoption frameworks. As a perspective
contribution, FAIGMOE provides the first comprehensive conceptual framework
explicitly addressing GenAI adoption across midsize and enterprise
organizations, offering actionable implementation protocols, assessment
instruments, and governance templates requiring empirical validation through
future research.

*Gareema Ranjan,Mahmoud Alfadel,Gengyi Sun,Shane McIntosh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究表明，放弃基于工件的构建工具（如Bazel）可能导致显著的性能损失和资源成本增加（如CI资源成本增加高达76%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究构建工具降级的实际影响，特别是对大型项目（如Kubernetes）的性能和资源成本的影响。

Method: 通过对Kubernetes项目从Bazel降级到Go Build的案例研究，重现并分析了降级期间的全量和增量构建性能。

Result: 研究发现，尽管降级（从Bazel到Go Build）可能减少了构建时间（从全量构建的23.06-38.66分钟到增量构建的75.19分钟），但Bazel在内存占用（81.42-351.07MB）和CPU负载（在高并行度设置下）上明显高于Go Build。

Conclusion: 尽管基于工件的现代构建工具（如Bazel）在性能上有优势，但大型项目（如Kubernetes）可能会因可维护性考虑而放弃它们，导致显著的性能损失和资源成本增加。

Abstract: Since developers invoke the build system frequently, its performance can
impact productivity. Modern artifact-based build tools accelerate builds, yet
prior work shows that teams may abandon them for alternatives that are easier
to maintain. While prior work shows why downgrades are performed, the
implications of downgrades remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
describe a case study of the Kubernetes project, focusing on its downgrade from
an artifact-based build tool (Bazel) to a language-specific solution (Go
Build). We reproduce and analyze the full and incremental builds of change sets
during the downgrade period. On the one hand, we find that Bazel builds are
faster than Go Build, completing full builds in 23.06-38.66 up to 75.19 impose
a larger memory footprint than Go Build of 81.42-351.07 respectively. Bazel
builds also impose a greater CPU load at parallelism settings above eight for
full builds and above one for incremental builds. We estimate that downgrading
from Bazel can increase CI resource costs by up to 76 explore whether our
observations generalize by replicating our Kubernetes study on four other
projects that also downgraded from Bazel to older build tools. We observe that
while build time penalties decrease, Bazel consistently consumes more memory.
We conclude that abandoning artifact-based build tools, despite perceived
maintainability benefits, tends to incur considerable performance costs for
large projects. Our observations may help stakeholders to balance trade-offs in
build tool adoption

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件技术的发展促使企业迁移其RAD应用，如Oracle Forms，而PL/SQL代码的迁移需求推动了模型驱动再工程的研究。

Method: 使用KDM模型表示遗留代码，结合TDD-like方法逐步开发模型转换，并引入三种代码验证机制。

Result: 开发了一个迁移工具，成功将PL/SQL代码转换为分层的Java代码，并通过验证确保了代码质量。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种模型驱动的再工程方法，成功将PL/SQL代码迁移至Java，并通过TDD-like方法验证了生成代码的有效性。

Abstract: Model-driven software engineering (MDE) techniques are not only useful in
forward engineering scenarios, but can also be successfully applied to evolve
existing systems. RAD (Rapid Application Development) platforms emerged in the
nineties, but the success of modern software technologies motivated that a
large number of enterprises tackled the migration of their RAD applications,
such as Oracle Forms. Our research group has collaborated with a software
company in developing a solution to migrate PL/SQL monolithic code on Forms
triggers and program units to Java code separated in several tiers.
  Our research focused on the model-driven reengineering process applied to
develop the migration tool for the conversion of PL/SQL code to Java. Legacy
code is represented in form of KDM (Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel) models. In
this paper, we propose a software process to implement a model-driven
re-engineering. This process integrates a TDD-like approach to incrementally
develop model transformations with three kinds of validations for the generated
code. The implementation and validation of the re-engineering approach are
explained in detail, as well as the evaluation of some issues related with the
application of MDE.

TL;DR: NSync是一个自动化系统，通过API追踪和LLM技术解决IaC配置漂移问题，显著提升配置更新效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IaC工具与云控制台、CLI或SDK并用时，无法感知外部变更，导致配置漂移，影响后续操作。

Method: NSync利用API调用追踪检测非IaC变更，并通过LLM推断高层次意图，合成针对性的IaC更新。其自进化知识库不断优化性能。

Result: 在五个真实Terraform项目和372个漂移场景中，NSync在准确性（从0.71提升至0.97 pass@3）和令牌效率（1.47倍提升）上均优于基线。

Conclusion: NSync通过自动化系统有效解决了基础设施即代码（IaC）与外部工具并用时出现的配置漂移问题，显著提升了配置更新的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally,
cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of
choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have
quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the
infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of
automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,
or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment
with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,
or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure
drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may
undo valid updates or trigger errors.
  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates
out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that
infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the
lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API
traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update
the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic
architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API
sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and
continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past
reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting
realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation
performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372
drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of
accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$
improvement).

Motivation: Java缺乏对运行时依赖自省的支持，这对软件供应链安全至关重要。

Method: Classport通过在Java类文件中嵌入依赖信息，支持运行时依赖信息的检索。

Result: 在六个实际项目中评估Classport，证明了其在运行时识别依赖的可行性。

Conclusion: Classport成功地将依赖信息嵌入Java类文件，实现了运行时依赖信息的检索，为运行时完整性检查开辟了重要途径。

Abstract: Runtime introspection of dependencies, i.e., the ability to observe which
dependencies are currently used during program execution, is fundamental for
Software Supply Chain security. Yet, Java has no support for it. We solve this
problem with Classport, a system that embeds dependency information into Java
class files, enabling the retrieval of dependency information at runtime. We
evaluate Classport on six real-world projects, demonstrating the feasibility in
identifying dependencies at runtime. Runtime dependency introspection with
Classport opens important avenues for runtime integrity checking.

Motivation: 当前分布式联合仿真在保护知识产权（IP）和防范黑客攻击方面缺乏共识和指导，需要一种更安全的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于UniFMU的分布式联合仿真方法，包含客户端发起连接、模型和二进制文件托管在可信平台等机制。

Result: 通过四个不同网络设置下的两个联合仿真演示验证了方法的可行性，并分析了IP保护与性能效率的权衡。

Conclusion: 分布式联合仿真在UniFMU平台上结合增强的网络安全和IP保护机制，有效平衡了IP保护与性能效率之间的权衡。

Abstract: Distributed co-simulation plays a key role in enabling collaborative modeling
and simulation by different stakeholders while protecting their Intellectual
Property (IP). Although IP protection is provided implicitly by co-simulation,
there is no consensus in the guidelines to conduct distributed co-simulation of
continuous-time or hybrid systems with no exposure to potential hacking
attacks. We propose an approach for distributed co-simulation on top of UniFMU
with enhanced cybersecurity and IP protection mechanisms, ensuring that the
connection is initiated by the client and the models and binaries live on
trusted platforms. We showcase the functionality of this approach using two
co-simulation demos in four different network settings and analyze the
trade-off between IP-protected distribution and performance efficiency in these
settings.

Motivation: 尽管演绎验证在特定项目中已被证明有效且可行，但仍未成为主流技术。本研究旨在探索其成功应用的因素及阻碍广泛采用的潜在问题。

Method: 采用半结构化访谈和主题分析方法，对来自工业界和学术界的30位验证实践者进行了调查。

Result: 研究不仅证实了已知挑战（如进行形式证明需要高水平专业知识），还揭示了未充分探索的障碍（如证明维护、自动化控制不足和可用性问题）。

Abstract: Deductive verification is an effective method to ensure that a given system
exposes the intended behavior. In spite of its proven usefulness and
feasibility in selected projects, deductive verification is still not a
mainstream technique. To pave the way to widespread use, we present a study
investigating the factors enabling successful applications of deductive
verification and the underlying issues preventing broader adoption. We
conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners of verification from
both industry and academia and systematically analyzed the collected data
employing a thematic analysis approach. Beside empirically confirming familiar
challenges, e.g., the high level of expertise needed for conducting formal
proofs, our data reveal several underexplored obstacles, such as proof
maintenance, insufficient control over automation, and usability concerns. We
further use the results from our data analysis to extract enablers and barriers
for deductive verification and formulate concrete recommendations for
practitioners, tool builders, and researchers, including principles for
usability, automation, and integration with existing workflows.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在代码相关任务中表现出色，但其修复效果高度依赖上游错误定位的性能，而目前缺乏对其全面评估。

Method: 通过系统实证研究，评估了开源模型（Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct、DeepSeek-V3）和闭源模型（GPT-4.1 mini、Gemini-2.5-flash）在HumanEval-Java和Defects4J数据集上的错误定位能力，并研究了不同提示策略（标准提示、少量示例、推理链）对模型性能的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，结合错误报告上下文能显著提升模型性能。少量学习虽显示改进潜力但存在边际效益递减现象，而推理链的有效性高度依赖模型固有的推理能力。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅揭示了不同模型在代码错误定位任务中的性能特点和权衡，还为当前大型语言模型的优势及提升错误定位效果的策略提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the
effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of
upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently
lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the
statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative
open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source
models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization
capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study
investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard
prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with
a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost
dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context
significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for
improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while
chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance
characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks,
but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and
strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.

### [138] [A Soundness and Precision Benchmark for Java Debloating Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20679)
*Jonas Klauke,Tom Ohlmer,Stefan Schott,Serena Elisa Ponta,Wolfram Fischer,Eric Bodden*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究表明多数软件依赖未被使用，促使开发去膨胀工具。通过Deblometer评估三种工具发现，动态类加载导致普遍不健全，各工具在精确性和健全性上各有优劣，需进一步改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发中，项目平均包含36个依赖项，其中80%是传递依赖。研究表明仅24.9%的依赖在运行时是必需的，且许多程序构造未被使用，增加了不必要的代码。这促使了去膨胀工具的开发，以移除不必要的依赖和程序构造，同时平衡精确性和健全性。

Method: 开发了Deblometer微基准测试套件，包含59个测试用例，用于评估去膨胀工具对Java语言特性的支持。每个测试用例包含手动标注的必要和膨胀类、方法及字段，以精确测量工具的健全性和精确性。使用Deblometer评估了三种流行的Java去膨胀工具：Deptrim、JShrink和ProGuard。

Result: 所有工具均移除必要的程序构造，导致语义改变或执行崩溃。动态类加载功能在所有评估工具中引入不健全现象。Deptrim保留更多膨胀构造，ProGuard移除更多必要构造，JShrink因注解支持有限导致去膨胀产物损坏。

Conclusion: 当前的去膨胀工具在平衡精确性和健全性方面存在不足，特别是动态类加载功能导致所有评估工具都出现不健全现象。Deptrim保留更多膨胀构造，而ProGuard移除更多必要构造，JShrink因对注解支持有限导致去膨胀产物损坏。这些健全性问题凸显了改进去膨胀工具的必要性，以确保去膨胀软件的稳定性和可靠性。

Abstract: Modern software development reuses code by importing libraries as
dependencies. Software projects typically include an average of 36
dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of
dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies
are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain
unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development
of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs
while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by
preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off,
we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed
to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each
test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and
bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness
and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating
tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools
remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or
execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces
unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains
more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs.
JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for
annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness
issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and
reliable debloated software.

TL;DR: LLMs在自动生成访问控制策略时存在准确性问题，但与符号方法结合可有效分析策略，展现出应用前景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云计算的普及使得访问控制策略的复杂性和错误率增加，LLMs在代码合成和总结中的成功可能为自动生成和理解策略提供解决方案。

Method: 研究了LLMs在访问控制策略合成和总结中的效果，包括对不同LLMs的评估和引入基于语义的请求总结方法。

Result: LLMs生成语法正确策略的能力强，但与非推理LLMs相比，推理LLMs在策略符合性上表现更优（93.7% vs 45.8%）。语义总结方法在策略分析中显示出潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs虽然在自动生成访问控制策略方面存在限制，但与符号方法结合在分析现有策略时显示出潜力。

Abstract: Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted
on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to
write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to
private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to
their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often
implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to
precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated
code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be
used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in
understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of
LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we
first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding
that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,
they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given
specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time
for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze
policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach
which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests
allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles
in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results
when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文探讨6G网络自主性需超越KPI优化，通过代理AI实现环境感知与决策，但需解决认知偏差问题。教程分析偏差类型及缓解策略，用例验证其有效性（延迟降5倍，节能40%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络自主性不仅依赖KPI优化，还需感知和推理真实网络环境。代理AI虽能实现多目标决策，但可能继承人类设计中的认知偏差，影响决策质量。本文旨在揭示这些偏差并提供解决方案。

Method: 文章采用教程形式，结合神经科学和AI，系统分析了几种常见认知偏差的分类、定义、数学表达及其在电信系统中的表现，并提出了针对性缓解策略（如锚定随机化、时间衰减和拐点奖励技术）。

Result: 实际用例表明，提出的偏差缓解策略能显著提升网络性能：延迟降低5倍，节能约40%。

Conclusion: 本文提出通过代理AI（如LLM驱动的代理）实现6G网络更高自主性的路径，同时强调了认知偏差的挑战，并提供了针对特定偏差的缓解策略。通过实际用例验证，这些策略显著提升了网络性能（如延迟降低5倍，节能约40%）。

Abstract: The path to higher network autonomy in 6G lies beyond the mere optimization
of key performance indicators (KPIs). While KPIs have enabled automation gains
under TM Forum Levels 1--3, they remain numerical abstractions that act only as
proxies for the real essence of communication networks: seamless connectivity,
fairness, adaptability, and resilience. True autonomy requires perceiving and
reasoning over the network environment as it is. Such progress can be achieved
through \emph{agentic AI}, where large language model (LLM)-powered agents
perceive multimodal telemetry, reason with memory, negotiate across domains,
and act via APIs to achieve multi-objective goals. However, deploying such
agents introduces the challenge of cognitive biases inherited from human
design, which can distort reasoning, negotiation, tool use, and actuation.
Between neuroscience and AI, this paper provides a tutorial on a selection of
well-known biases, including their taxonomy, definition, mathematical
formulation, emergence in telecom systems and the commonly impacted agentic
components. The tutorial also presents various mitigation strategies tailored
to each type of bias. The article finally provides two practical use-cases,
which tackle the emergence, impact and mitigation gain of some famous biases in
6G inter-slice and cross-domain management. In particular, anchor
randomization, temporal decay and inflection bonus techniques are introduced to
specifically address anchoring, temporal and confirmation biases. This avoids
that agents stick to the initial high resource allocation proposal or decisions
that are recent and/or confirming a prior hypothesis. By grounding decisions in
a richer and fairer set of past experiences, the quality and bravery of the
agentic agreements in the second use-case, for instance, are leading to $\times
5$ lower latency and around $40\%$ higher energy saving.

### [141] [Rediscovering Recurring Routing Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20297)
*Xiao Song,John Heidemann*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Fenrir 是一个新系统，用于检测和量化路由变化，适用于多种网络性能优化场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路由对网络性能至关重要，但理解和控制路由对服务的影响具有挑战性。现有的流量工程（TE）和 BGP 无法完全反映全局路由策略的影响。

Method: Fenrir 通过主动测量、数据清理和加权等方法，检测和量化路由变化，并识别可能重现的路由“模式”。

Result: Fenrir 在多种系统中得到验证，包括 anycast 服务、多宿主企业的路由优化以及顶级网站的选择，证明了其通用性和实用性。

Conclusion: Fenrir 是一个创新的系统，能够重新发现重复的路由结果，并通过检测和量化路由变化，帮助解决多种网络性能问题。

Abstract: Routing is central to networking performance, including: (1) latency in
anycast services and websites served from multiple locations,(2) networking
expenses and throughput in multi-homed enterprises, (3) the ability to keep
traffic domestic when considering data sovereignty. However, understanding and
managing how routing affects these services is challenging. Operators use
Traffic Engineering (TE) with BGP to optimize network performance, but what
they get is the result of all BGP policies throughout the Internet, not just
their local choices. Our paper proposes Fenrir, a new system to rediscover
recurring routing results. Fenrir can discover changes in network routing, even
when it happens multiple hops away from the observer. Fenrir also provides new
methods to quantify the degree of routing change, and to identify routing
"modes" that may reappear. Second, we show that Fenrir can be applied to many
different problems: we use five instances of three different types of systems
to illustrate the generalization: anycast catchments showing in a root DNS
service, route optimization for two multi-homed enterprises, and website
selection for two of the top-10 web services. Each type requires different
types of active measurements, data cleaning and weighting. We demonstrate
Fenrir's methods of detecting and quantifying change are helpful because they
all face similar operational questions: How much effect did traffic engineering
have? Did a third-party change alter my routing? In either case, is the current
routing new, or is it like a routing mode I saw before?

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 多播分区技术通过分割多播树，优化带宽利用和调度难度，显著提升动态系统的可调度性和网络吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多播通信可以节省网络带宽，但会复杂化流量规划，尤其是在需要所有多播树分支上都有空闲队列或可用出口端口的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的多播分区技术，将多播树分割为更小的多播或单播树，以更精细地权衡带宽利用和流量调度难度。

Result: 在不同网络拓扑和三种调度算法下评估多播分区技术，结果显示分区后减少了5-15%的被拒绝数据流，网络吞吐量增加了5-125%。

Conclusion: 通过多播分区技术，可以在动态系统中提高可调度性，减少被拒绝的数据流数量并增加网络吞吐量。

Abstract: Multicast allows sending a message to multiple recipients without having to
create and send a separate message for each recipient. This preserves network
bandwidth, which is particularly important in time-sensitive networks. These
networks are commonly used to provide latency-bounded communication for
real-time systems in domains like automotive, avionics, industrial internet of
things, automated shop floors, and smart energy grids. The preserved bandwidth
can be used to admit additional real-time messages with specific quality of
service requirements or to reduce the end-to-end latencies for messages of any
type. However, using multicast communication can complicate traffic planning,
as it requires free queues or available downstream egress ports on all branches
of the multicast tree. In this work, we present a novel multicast partitioning
technique to split multicast trees into smaller multicast or unicast trees.
This allows for a more fine-grained trade-off between bandwidth utilization and
traffic scheduling difficulty. Thus, schedulability in dynamic systems can be
improved, in terms the number of admitted streams and the accumulated network
throughput. We evaluated the multicast partitioning on different network
topologies and with three different scheduling algorithms. With the
partitioning, 5-15\% fewer streams were rejected, while achieving 5-125\% more
network throughput, depending on the scheduling algorithm.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI工具在可编程网络等新领域中生成代码的可靠性和功能性。

Method: 通过定义三个复杂度递增的网络任务，并采用零样本和少样本提示技术，将生成的POX控制器代码在Mininet模拟的网络拓扑中进行功能、正确性和手动修复需求的测试。

Result: 所有测试模型均能生成功能性控制器，其中ChatGPT和DeepSeek表现更稳定且代码质量更高，Copilot和BlackBox.ai则需要更多调整。

Conclusion: 所有评估的生成式AI工具都能产生功能性网络控制器，但ChatGPT和DeepSeek在一致性和代码质量上表现更优，而Copilot和BlackBox.ai需要更多手动调整。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have been used to generate
human-like content across multiple domains (e.g., sound, image, text, and
programming). However, their reliability in terms of correctness and
functionality in novel contexts such as programmable networks remains unclear.
Hence, this paper presents an empirical evaluation of the source code of a POX
controller generated by different AI tools, namely ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
and BlackBox.ai. To evaluate such a code, three networking tasks of increasing
complexity were defined and for each task, zero-shot and few-shot prompting
techniques were input to the tools. Next, the output code was tested in
emulated network topologies with Mininet and analyzed according to
functionality, correctness, and the need for manual fixes. Results show that
all evaluated models can produce functional controllers. However, ChatGPT and
DeepSeek exhibited higher consistency and code quality, while Copilot and
BlackBox.ai required more adjustments.

Motivation: 5G和未来6G移动网络对实时服务提供的敏捷性、可扩展性、弹性和精确性提出了更高要求，传统和启发式资源管理技术无法满足这些需求。

Conclusion: 将AI能力嵌入数字孪生技术为未来移动网络的完全自主、自适应和高性能网络管理铺平了道路。

Abstract: As 5G and future 6G mobile networks become increasingly more sophisticated,
the requirements for agility, scalability, resilience, and precision in
real-time service provisioning cannot be met using traditional and
heuristic-based resource management techniques, just like any advancing
technology. With the aim of overcoming such limitations, network operators are
foreseeing Digital Twins (DTs) as key enablers, which are designed as dynamic
and virtual replicas of network infrastructure, allowing operators to model,
analyze, and optimize various operations without any risk of affecting the live
network. However, for Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) to meet the challenges faced
by operators especially in line with resource management, a driving engine is
needed. In this paper, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven approach is
presented by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network into
the DT framework, aimed at forecasting network traffic patterns and proactively
managing resource allocation. Through analytical experiments, the AI-Enabled DT
framework demonstrates superior performance benchmarked against baseline
methods. Our study concludes that embedding AI capabilities within DTs paves
the way for fully autonomous, adaptive, and high-performance network management
in future mobile networks.

Motivation: 传统聚类和分类方法无法充分表示复杂图像集合中的重叠关系，特别是在缺乏标记数据或合适的预训练模型时。超图能有效捕捉重叠关系，但需要可视化技术将其复杂性转化为领域专家可理解的信息和洞察。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的流程，直接从原始图像数据构建超图，包括相似性度量以评估构建的超图与真实情况的对比；集成了空间超图表示、交互式网格和矩阵可视化技术，使用户能够动态探索和解释关系而不感到不知所措。

Conclusion: 本文提出的交互式视觉分析方法能够有效帮助领域专家从大规模复杂图像集合中高效提取洞察，支持包含数万张图像的迭代探索。

Abstract: Analyzing large complex image collections in domains like forensics, accident
investigation, or social media analysis involves interpreting intricate,
overlapping relationships among images. Traditional clustering and
classification methods fail to adequately represent these complex
relationships, particularly when labeled data or suitable pre-trained models
are unavailable. Hypergraphs effectively capture overlapping relationships, but
to translate their complexity into information and insights for domain expert
users visualization is essential. We propose an interactive visual analytics
approach specifically designed for the construction, exploration, and analysis
of hypergraphs on large-scale complex image collections. Our core contributions
include: (1) a scalable pipeline for constructing hypergraphs directly from raw
image data, including a similarity measure to evaluate constructed hypergraphs
against a ground truth, (2) interactive visualization techniques that integrate
spatial hypergraph representations, interactive grids, and matrix
visualizations, enabling users to dynamically explore and interpret
relationships without becoming overwhelmed and disoriented, and (3) practical
insights on how domain experts can effectively use the application, based on
evaluation with real-life image collections. Our results demonstrate that our
visual analytics approach facilitates iterative exploration, enabling domain
experts to efficiently derive insights from image collections containing tens
of thousands of images.

TL;DR: 论文简化了轮消除自约技术，提供了最大匹配、b-匹配和边着色问题的新下界证明，使复杂证明更易理解和推广。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于最大匹配的随机LOCAL算法下界证明复杂且难以推广，简化证明有助于更好地理解图问题的复杂性。

Method: 采用简化的轮消除自约技术，对现有复杂证明进行简化，并应用于多个图问题。

Result: 证明了最大b-匹配和边着色问题的随机LOCAL算法下界，分别为Ω(min{log_{1+b}Δ, log_Δ n})和Ω(√log_{1+b} n)轮，以及Ω(min{log Δ, log_Δ n})和Ω(√log n)轮。

Conclusion: 论文通过简化轮消除自约技术，提供了对最大匹配、最大b-匹配和边着色问题的新下界证明，并展示了这些技术的通用性。

Abstract: Very recently, Khoury and Schild [FOCS 2025] showed that any randomized LOCAL
algorithm that solves maximal matching requires $\Omega(\min\{\log \Delta,
\log_\Delta n\})$ rounds, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph and
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree. This result is shown through a new technique,
called round elimination via self-reduction. The lower bound proof is beautiful
and presents very nice ideas. However, it spans more than 25 pages of technical
details, and hence it is hard to digest and generalize to other problems.
Historically, the simplification of proofs and techniques has marked an
important turning point in our understanding of the complexity of graph
problems. Our paper makes a step forward towards this direction, and provides
the following contributions.
  1. We present a short and simplified version of the round elimination via
self-reduction technique. The simplification of this technique enables us to
obtain the following two hardness results.
  2. We show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that solves the maximal
$b$-matching problem requires $\Omega(\min\{\log_{1+b}\Delta, \log_\Delta n\})$
and $\Omega(\sqrt{\log_{1+b} n})$ rounds. We recall that the $b$-matching
problem is a generalization of the matching problem where each vertex can have
up to $b$ incident edges in the matching. As a corollary, for $b=1$, we obtain
a short proof for the maximal matching lower bound shown by Khoury and Schild.
  3. Finally, we show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that properly colors
the edges of a graph with $\Delta + k$ colors requires $\Omega(\min\{\log
\Delta, \log_\Delta n\})$ and $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds, for any $k\le
\Delta^{1-\varepsilon}$ and any constant $\varepsilon > 0$.

TL;DR: AsyncHZP 是一种新型异步 ZeRO 变体，通过自适应分片和多流调度，显著提升训练效率，简化大规模模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在大规模集群上的训练效率和可扩展性仍是一个关键瓶颈。主流方法如 ND 并行性通常繁琐且复杂，而灵活替代方案如 ZeRO 则常受通信开销困扰。

Method: AsyncHZP 是一种新颖的异步变体，通过自适应地在不同副本组之间重新分片参数、梯度和优化器状态，优化设备内存利用并显著减少通信开销。此外，设计了多流异步调度方法，在专用后台线程中执行参数全收集和梯度减少分散操作。

Result: 在密集和专家混合模型上的实证评估表明，AsyncHZP 在大规模下保持稳健稳定性，始终优于经典 ND 并行性，无需复杂策略调整即可实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: AsyncHZP 在保持简单性和内存效率的同时，实现了卓越的性能，简化了大规模训练的效率路径。

Abstract: The training efficiency and scalability of language models on massive
clusters currently remain a critical bottleneck. Mainstream approaches like ND
parallelism are often cumbersome and complex, while flexible alternatives such
as the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) are frequently hampered by
communication overhead. In this paper, we propose Asynchronous Hierarchical
Zero Parallelism (AsyncHZP), a novel asynchronous variant of ZeRO designed to
achieve superior performance while maintaining simplicity and memory
efficiency. Unlike traditional ZeRO, which employs over-fine-grained sharding
that can lead to inefficient communication, AsyncHZP adaptively reshards
parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across different replica groups.
This strategy optimizes device memory utilization and significantly reduces
communication overhead. In addition, we also design a multi-stream asynchronous
scheduling method that executes parameter all-gather and gradient
reduce-scatter operations in dedicated background threads, effectively
overlapping communication with computation while incurring negligible memory
fragmentation. Empirical evaluations on both Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models confirm that AsyncHZP maintains robust stability at scale. It
consistently outperforms classic ND parallelism, achieving state-of-the-art
performance without complex strategic tuning, thereby simplifying the path to
efficient large-scale training.

Abstract: To address the growing needs for scalable High Performance Computing (HPC)

framework and its hybrid workload development capability with modular
hardware/device-agnostic software integration approach. The latest development
in extensible interfaces for quantum programming, dispatching, and compilation
within existing mature HPC programming environment are demonstrated. Our HPC-QC
full stack enables high-level, portable invocation of quantum kernels from
commercial quantum SDKs within HPC meta-program in compiled languages (C/C++
and Fortran) as well as Python through a quantum programming interface library
extension. An adaptive circuit knitting hypervisor is being developed to
partition large quantum circuits into sub-circuits that fit on smaller noisy
quantum devices and classical simulators. At the lower-level, we leverage Cray
LLVM-based compilation framework to transform and consume LLVM IR and Quantum
IR (QIR) from commercial quantum software frontends in a retargetable fashion
to different hardware architectures. Several hybrid HPC-QC multi-node multi-CPU
and GPU workloads (including solving linear system of equations, quantum
optimization, and simulating quantum phase transitions) have been demonstrated
on HPE EX supercomputers to illustrate functionality and execution viability
for all three components developed so far. This work provides the framework for
a unified quantum-classical programming environment built upon classical HPC
software stack (compilers, libraries, parallel runtime and process scheduling).

workloads extend to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. Traditional communication
methods face significant throughput and latency limitations at this scale,
hindering both the development and deployment of state-of-the-art models. This
paper presents the NCCLX collective communication framework, developed at Meta,
engineered to optimize performance across the full LLM lifecycle, from the
synchronous demands of large-scale training to the low-latency requirements of
inference. The framework is designed to support complex workloads on clusters
exceeding 100,000 GPUs, ensuring reliable, high-throughput, and low-latency
data exchange. Empirical evaluation on the Llama4 model demonstrates
substantial improvements in communication efficiency. This research contributes
a robust solution for enabling the next generation of LLMs to operate at
unprecedented scales.

Motivation: 云计算的弹性特性使其成为新兴技术的支撑，而自动扩缩系统是实现这一弹性的关键。FLAS旨在通过结合主动和被动方法，优化每个时刻的扩缩决策。

Method: FLAS结合了预测模型（预测高阶指标趋势）和被动应急系统（从资源使用指标估计高阶指标），减少了必要的仪器化。

Conclusion: FLAS通过结合主动和被动方法，成功确保了分布式服务在99%以上的时间内满足性能要求，验证了其有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Cloud computing has established itself as the support for the vast majority
of emerging technologies, mainly due to the characteristic of elasticity it
offers. Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring
and releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this
article we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for
distributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive
approaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in
every moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model
of the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the
relevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or
throughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of
high-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary
instrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to
different applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a
content-based publish-subscribe middleware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone
of an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed
systems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service). Through
an evaluation based on several test cases recreating not only the expected
contexts of use, but also the worst possible scenarios (following the
Boundary-Value Analysis or BVA test methodology), we have validated our
approach and demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution by ensuring
compliance with performance requirements over 99% of the time.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A methodology for building efficient performance predictors in edge environments achieves high accuracy and low latency, improving resource utilization and performance predictability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of achieving predictable performance in resource-constrained dynamic edge environments due to application co-location and node heterogeneity.

Method: The methodology involves automatically building and assessing various performance predictors, prioritizing accuracy and inference time to identify the most efficient model. Predictors are trained on historical data of correlated monitoring metrics and evaluated across multiple servers.

Result: The proposed predictors achieve up to 90% accuracy with inference times less than 1% of the Round Trip Time, demonstrating effectiveness in dynamic co-location scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating server-specific predictors optimized for both accuracy and inference latency can significantly improve resource utilization and ensure predictable performance in dynamic edge environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of application performance is critical for enabling
effective scheduling and resource management in resource-constrained dynamic
edge environments. However, achieving predictable performance in such
environments remains challenging due to the co-location of multiple
applications and the node heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a
methodology that automatically builds and assesses various performance
predictors. This approach prioritizes both accuracy and inference time to
identify the most efficient model. Our predictors achieve up to 90% accuracy
while maintaining an inference time of less than 1% of the Round Trip Time.
These predictors are trained on the historical state of the most correlated
monitoring metrics to application performance and evaluated across multiple
servers in dynamic co-location scenarios. As usecase we consider electron
microscopy (EM) workflows, which have stringent real-time demands and diverse
resource requirements. Our findings emphasize the need for a systematic
methodology that selects server-specific predictors by jointly optimizing
accuracy and inference latency in dynamic co-location scenarios. Integrating
such predictors into edge environments can improve resource utilization and
result in predictable performance.

Conclusion: 该论文展示了预测性负载均衡在分布式应用中的可行性，特别是在边缘和云计算环境中，通过减少应用RTT和最小化资源浪费，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Distributed applications increasingly demand low end-to-end latency,
especially in edge and cloud environments where co-located workloads contend
for limited resources. Traditional load-balancing strategies are typically
reactive and rely on outdated or coarse-grained metrics, often leading to
suboptimal routing decisions and increased tail latencies. This paper
investigates the use of round-trip time (RTT) predictors to enhance request
routing by anticipating application latency. We develop lightweight and
accurate RTT predictors that are trained on time-series monitoring data
collected from a Kubernetes-managed GPU cluster. By leveraging a reduced set of
highly correlated monitoring metrics, our approach maintains low overhead while
remaining adaptable to diverse co-location scenarios and heterogeneous
hardware. The predictors achieve up to 95% accuracy while keeping the
prediction delay within 10% of the application RTT. In addition, we identify
the minimum prediction accuracy threshold and key system-level factors required
to ensure effective predictor deployment in resource-constrained clusters.
Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that performance-aware load balancing
can significantly reduce application RTT and minimize resource waste. These
results highlight the feasibility of integrating predictive load balancing into
future production systems.

Abstract: Accurate robot kinematics is essential for precise tool placement in
articulated robots, but non-geometric factors can introduce
configuration-dependent model discrepancies. This paper presents a
configuration-dependent kinematic calibration framework for improving accuracy
across the entire workspace. Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,
selected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple
configurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity
load expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized
by the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural
network and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training
efficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed
approach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the
sub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with
larger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot
collaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and
repeatability.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation of diverse objects remains a core challenge in
robotics, driven by unknown physical properties and the complexity of
contact-rich interactions. Recent advances in contact-implicit model predictive
control (CI-MPC), with contact reasoning embedded directly in the trajectory
optimization, have shown promise in tackling the task efficiently and robustly,
yet demonstrations have been limited to narrowly curated examples. In this
work, we showcase the broader capabilities of CI-MPC through precise planar
pushing tasks over a wide range of object geometries, including multi-object
domains. These scenarios demand reasoning over numerous inter-object and
object-environment contacts to strategically manipulate and de-clutter the
environment, challenges that were intractable for prior CI-MPC methods. To
achieve this, we introduce Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+), an
enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a complete pipeline spanning object
scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. Compared to its
predecessor C3, C3+ achieves substantially faster solve times, enabling
real-time performance even in multi-object pushing tasks. On hardware, our
system achieves overall 98% success rate across 33 objects, reaching pose goals
within tight tolerances. The average time-to-goal is approximately 0.5, 1.6,
3.2, and 5.3 minutes for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-object tasks, respectively. Project

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning a generalizable minimum-time
flight policy for UAVs, capable of navigating between arbitrary start and goal
states while balancing agile flight and stable hovering. Traditional
approaches, particularly in autonomous drone racing, achieve impressive speeds
and agility but are constrained to predefined track layouts, limiting
real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a reinforcement
learning-based framework that simultaneously learns state-to-state minimum-time
planning and control and generalizes to arbitrary state-to-state flights. Our
approach leverages Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as proxy rewards to
approximate the true optimal flight objective and employs curriculum learning
to scale the training process efficiently and to achieve generalization. We
validate our method through simulation experiments, comparing it against
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tracking PMM-generated trajectories
and conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of curriculum learning.
Finally, real-world experiments confirm the robustness of our learned policy in
outdoor environments, demonstrating its ability to generalize and operate on a
small ARM-based single-board computer.

Conclusion: 该研究总结了当前基于逆运动学的Stewart平台并联运动学机器（PKM）校准技术的研究现状，指出了在无负载条件下考虑结构误差和环境因素的校准方法，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Stewart platform-based Parallel Kinematic (PKM) Machines have been
extensively studied by researchers due to their inherent finer control
characteristics. This has opened its potential deployment opportunities in
versatile critical applications like the medical field, engineering machines,
space research, electronic chip manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, etc.
All these precise, complicated, and repeatable motion applications require
micro and nano-scale movement control in 3D space; a 6-DOF PKM can take this
challenge smartly. For this, the PKM must be more accurate than the desired
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a PKM robot is
essential. Forward kinematics-based calibration for such hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To analyze different techniques, an external instrument-based,
constraint-based, and auto or self-calibration-based approaches have been used
for calibration. This survey has been done by reviewing these key
methodologies, their outcome, and important points related to inverse
kinematic-based PKM calibrations in general. It is observed in this study that
the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position and
orientation considering the errors contributed by a single source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly structural, in some cases,
environmental factors are also considered, however, these calibrations are done
under no-load conditions. This study aims to understand the current state of
the art in this field and to expand the scope for other researchers in further
exploration in a specific area.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a complex process that creates
free-form geometric objects by sequentially placing material to construct an
object, usually in a layer-by-layer process. One of the most widely used
methods is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is used in many of the
consumer-grade polymer 3D printers available today. While consumer grade
machines are cheap and plentiful, they lack many of the features desired in a
machine used for research purposes and are often closed-source platforms.
Commercial-grade models are more expensive and are also usually closed-source
platforms that do not offer flexibility for modifications often needed for
research. The authors designed and fabricated a machine to be used as a test
bed for research in the field of polymer FDM processes. The goal was to create
a platform that tightly controls and/or monitors the FDM build parameters so
that experiments can be repeated with a known accuracy. The platform offers
closed loop position feedback, control of the hot end and bed temperature, and
monitoring of environment temperature and humidity. Additionally, the platform
is equipped with cameras and a mechanism for in-situ photogrammetry, creating a
geometric record of the printing throughout the printing process. Through
photogrammetry, backtracking and linking process parameters to observable
geometric defects can be achieved. This paper focuses on the design of a novel
mechanism for spinning the heated bed to allow for photogrammetric
reconstruction of the printed part using a minimal number of cameras, as
implemented on this platform.

Abstract: Robotic arms require precise, task-aware trajectory planning, yet sequence

accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of
paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6

success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing
locomotion that explicitly addresses uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion. A
physics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is
incorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity,
and probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable
reliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait
on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to
vertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic
adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a
high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from
detachment in simulation under degraded adhesion. Compared with a model
predictive control (MPC) baseline that assumes perfect adhesion, our controller
maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost. Hardware
experiments with the untethered robot further confirm robust vertical crawling
on steel surfaces, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and
incomplete attachment. These results show that combining curriculum learning
with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for
magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.

Abstract: Robots often face manipulation tasks in environments where vision is
inadequate due to clutter, occlusions, or poor lighting--for example, reaching
a shutoff valve at the back of a sink cabinet or locating a light switch above
a crowded shelf. In such settings, robots, much like humans, must rely on
contact feedback to distinguish free from occupied space and navigate around
obstacles. Many of these environments often exhibit strong structural
priors--for instance, pipes often span across sink cabinets--that can be
exploited to anticipate unseen structure and avoid unnecessary collisions. We
present a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for
manipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural
priors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework
comprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and
localization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle
filter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module
that uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map
of the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned
predictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact
localization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths
that avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating
feasible solutions. We evaluate the system in simulation and in the real world
on a UR10e manipulator across two domestic tasks--(i) manipulating a valve
under a kitchen sink surrounded by pipes and (ii) retrieving a target object
from a cluttered shelf. Results show that the framework reliably solves these
tasks, achieving up to a 2x reduction in task completion time compared to
baselines, with ablations confirming the contribution of each module.

Abstract: This study experimentally validates the principle of large-scale satellite
swarm control through learning-aided magnetic field interactions generated by
satellite-mounted magnetorquers. This actuation presents a promising solution
for the long-term formation maintenance of multiple satellites and has
primarily been demonstrated in ground-based testbeds for two-satellite position
control. However, as the number of satellites increases beyond three,
fundamental challenges coupled with the high nonlinearity arise: 1)
nonholonomic constraints, 2) underactuation, 3) scalability, and 4)
computational cost. Previous studies have shown that time-integrated current
control theoretically solves these problems, where the average actuator outputs
align with the desired command, and a learning-based technique further enhances
their performance. Through multiple experiments, we validate critical aspects
of learning-aided time-integrated current control: (1) enhanced controllability
of the averaged system dynamics, with a theoretically guaranteed error bound,
and (2) decentralized current management. We design two-axis coils and a
ground-based experimental setup utilizing an air-bearing platform, enabling a
mathematical replication of orbital dynamics. Based on the effectiveness of the
learned interaction model, we introduce NODA-MMH (Neural power-Optimal Dipole
Allocation for certified learned Model-based Magnetically swarm control
Harness) for model-based power-optimal swarm control. This study complements
our tutorial paper on magnetically actuated swarms for the long-term formation

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

TL;DR: MemER通过分层策略设计，使机器人策略能高效处理长时记忆任务，在长时程操作中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类依赖记忆执行任务，而现有机器人策略缺乏这一能力。直接依赖长观察历史计算成本高且脆弱，而无差别子采样则导致信息冗余或无关。

Method: 提出了一种分层策略框架，高层策略负责选择和跟踪历史关键帧，低层策略执行生成的指令。该方法与现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型兼容。

Result: MemER在三个需要分钟级记忆的真实世界长时程机器人操作任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemER框架通过分层策略设计，成功解决了机器人策略在长时记忆任务中的效率与鲁棒性问题，显著提升了长时程操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Humans routinely rely on memory to perform tasks, yet most robot policies
lack this capability; our goal is to endow robot policies with the same
ability. Naively conditioning on long observation histories is computationally
expensive and brittle under covariate shift, while indiscriminate subsampling
of history leads to irrelevant or redundant information. We propose a
hierarchical policy framework, where the high-level policy is trained to select
and track previous relevant keyframes from its experience. The high-level
policy uses selected keyframes and the most recent frames when generating text
instructions for a low-level policy to execute. This design is compatible with
existing vision-language-action (VLA) models and enables the system to
efficiently reason over long-horizon dependencies. In our experiments, we
finetune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and $\pi_{0.5}$ as the high-level and low-level
policies respectively, using demonstrations supplemented with minimal language
annotations. Our approach, MemER, outperforms prior methods on three real-world
long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory. Videos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有端到端方法在域转移（如天气和光照变化）下鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 提出DDP，整合视觉基础模型与扩散规划，在CARLA中训练并在对抗性设置中零样本转移。

Result: 在测试的所有OOD场景中，停车成功率持续高于90%，且在3DGS环境中展示了良好的仿真到现实转移潜力。

Conclusion: DDP（Dino-Diffusion Parking）通过结合视觉基础模型和基于扩散的规划，在域转移下实现了泛化感知和鲁棒运动规划，显著提升了跨域性能。

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模块化可重构机器人适用于特定任务的空间操作，但形态组合的增长阻碍了统一控制。

Method: 采用去中心化强化学习（Dec-RL），其中每个模块学习自己的策略：轮子模块使用Soft Actor-Critic（SAC）进行运动，7-DoF肢体使用Proximal Policy Optimization（PPO）进行转向和操作。

Result: 在仿真中，转向策略的平均绝对误差为3.63度，操作策略在目标偏移标准上达到84.6%的成功率，轮子策略将平均电机扭矩降低了95.4%，同时保持99.6%的成功率。月球模拟现场测试验证了零样本集成的自主运动、转向和初步对齐能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种去中心化强化学习方案，适用于模块化可重构机器人的统一控制，经过仿真和月球模拟现场测试验证，展示了其可扩展性、可重用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modular reconfigurable robots suit task-specific space operations, but the
combinatorial growth of morphologies hinders unified control. We propose a
decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) scheme where each module learns
its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion and
7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and
manipulation, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations. In
simulation, the steering policy achieved a mean absolute error of 3.63{\deg}
between desired and induced angles; the manipulation policy plateaued at 84.6 %
success on a target-offset criterion; and the wheel policy cut average motor
torque by 95.4 % relative to baseline while maintaining 99.6 % success.
Lunar-analogue field tests validated zero-shot integration for autonomous
locomotion, steering, and preliminary alignment for reconfiguration. The system
transitioned smoothly among synchronous, parallel, and sequential modes for
Policy Execution, without idle states or control conflicts, indicating a
scalable, reusable, and robust approach for modular lunar robots.

TL;DR: NeuralTouch 结合 NDF 和触觉传感，通过深度强化学习优化抓取，显著提升准确性和鲁棒性，适用于多种操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NDF 单独使用时因相机校准不完美、点云不完整和物体变异性可能导致不准确的抓取姿态，而现有触觉传感方法通常局限于简单的预定义接触几何。

Method: 利用 NDF 隐式表示目标接触几何，并通过深度强化学习策略结合触觉反馈来优化抓取。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界的零样本迁移任务（如 peg-in-hole 和瓶盖开启）中，NeuralTouch 显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuralTouch 通过结合 NDF 和触觉传感，显著提升了抓取准确性和鲁棒性，为精确的机器人操作提供了一个通用框架。

Abstract: Grasping accuracy is a critical prerequisite for precise object manipulation,
often requiring careful alignment between the robot hand and object. Neural
Descriptor Fields (NDF) offer a promising vision-based method to generate
grasping poses that generalize across object categories. However, NDF alone can
produce inaccurate poses due to imperfect camera calibration, incomplete point
clouds, and object variability. Meanwhile, tactile sensing enables more precise
contact, but existing approaches typically learn policies limited to simple,
predefined contact geometries. In this work, we introduce NeuralTouch, a
multimodal framework that integrates NDF and tactile sensing to enable
accurate, generalizable grasping through gentle physical interaction. Our
approach leverages NDF to implicitly represent the target contact geometry,
from which a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained to refine the
grasp using tactile feedback. This policy is conditioned on the neural
descriptors and does not require explicit specification of contact types. We
validate NeuralTouch through ablation studies in simulation and zero-shot
transfer to real-world manipulation tasks--such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle
lid opening--without additional fine-tuning. Results show that NeuralTouch
significantly improves grasping accuracy and robustness over baseline methods,
offering a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation.

Method: 采用xLSTM作为骨干网络，将点云地图与RGB数据高效融合，提出了一种新型的扩散策略方法。

Result: 在RoboCasa和CALVIN基准测试及真实机器人评估中，PointMapPolicy表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: PointMapPolicy通过结合点云和RGB数据，在多模态感知中实现了最先进的性能，展示了在复杂操作任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems benefit from complementary sensing modalities,
where each provides unique environmental information. Point clouds capture
detailed geometric structure, while RGB images provide rich semantic context.
Current point cloud methods struggle to capture fine-grained detail, especially
for complex tasks, which RGB methods lack geometric awareness, which hinders
their precision and generalization. We introduce PointMapPolicy, a novel
approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points
without downsampling. The resulting data type makes it easier to extract shape
and spatial relationships from observations, and can be transformed between
reference frames. Yet due to their structure in a regular grid, we enable the
use of established computer vision techniques directly to 3D data. Using xLSTM
as a backbone, our model efficiently fuses the point maps with RGB data for
enhanced multi-modal perception. Through extensive experiments on the RoboCasa
and CALVIN benchmarks and real robot evaluations, we demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We present a mixed reality-based underwater robot arm teleoperation system
with a reaction torque indicator via bilateral control (MR-UBi). The reaction
torque indicator (RTI) overlays a color and length-coded torque bar in the
MR-HMD, enabling seamless integration of visual and haptic feedback during
underwater robot arm teleoperation. User studies with sixteen participants
compared MR-UBi against a bilateral-control baseline. MR-UBi significantly
improved grasping-torque control accuracy, increasing the time within the
optimal torque range and reducing both low and high grasping torque range
during lift and pick-and-place tasks with objects of different stiffness.
Subjective evaluations further showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload

Result: 方法在实际工业机器人系统上成功验证，能够生成平滑的机器人轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法通过使用B样条曲线表示机器人路径，实现了在考虑TCP给定速度的同时，规划出平滑的机器人轨迹，并在实际工业机器人系统上进行了验证。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for planning a trajectory in workspace
coordinates using a spatially fixed tool center point (TCP), while taking into
account the processing path on a part. This approach is beneficial if it is
easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical
description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a
design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines.
The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree,
which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot
trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the
TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an
industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.

Abstract: Accurate long-term localization using onboard sensors is crucial for robots
operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments.
While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the
available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size,
weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances
the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal
data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive
multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph
formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial
Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a
loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging
reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel
interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements.
LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian.
A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein
distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical
analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under
various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The
proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with
heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in
localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.

Method: 论文提出了两种参考轨迹生成方法：第一种方法将参数不确定性直接嵌入到鲁棒最优控制方法中，以最小化预期任务成本；第二种方法考虑最小化所谓的‘最优性损失’，它衡量了参数相关信息对任务性能的敏感性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的两种方法在考虑参数不确定性的情况下，通过优化任务执行和系统识别，实现了更快、更准确的任务性能，同时保证了控制的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown
dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active
exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are
essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual
control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for
parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the
structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.
Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first
directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that
minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the
so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant
information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches
reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their
formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We
show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the
control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system
identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.

Result: 在两个（并行）机器人应用中测试了能量减少的假设，结果证实了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文通过优化SEA驱动PKM的操作轨迹和刚度，验证了该方法在减少能量消耗方面的有效性。

Abstract: A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks
that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place
operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed.
These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore
minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses
this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic
actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy
consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea
is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit
their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic
pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is
derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is
formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are
optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not
account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design
and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two
(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The
results confirm the validity of this approach.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于最大化路径速度的新方法，有效解决了时间最优路径跟随中的计算挑战，能够高效生成平滑轨迹。

Abstract: In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are
addressed. The standard approach is to minimize the travel time, which
inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the
optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory
generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging,
since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different
approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the
path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of
planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete
reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.

Abstract: Despite well-reported instances of robots being used in disaster response,
there is scant published data on the internal composition of the void spaces
within structural collapse incidents. Data collected during these incidents is
mired in legal constraints, as ownership is often tied to the responding
agencies, with little hope of public release for research. While engineered
rubble piles are used for training, these sites are also reluctant to release
information about their proprietary training grounds. To overcome this access
challenge, we present RubbleSim -- an open-source, reconfigurable simulator for
photorealistic void space exploration. The design of the simulation assets is
directly informed by visits to numerous training rubble sites at differing
levels of complexity. The simulator is implemented in Unity with
multi-operating system support. The simulation uses a physics-based approach to
build stochastic rubble piles, allowing for rapid iteration between simulation
worlds while retaining absolute knowledge of the ground truth. Using RubbleSim,
we apply a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm to illustrate how
perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions inside the
emulated void spaces. Pre-built binaries and source code to implement are

Conclusion: C-Nav通过双路径抗遗忘机制和自适应采样策略，在持续对象导航任务中显著优于现有方法，同时降低了内存需求。

Abstract: Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic,
open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static
trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking
the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To
facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation
benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object
categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned
knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual
navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path
anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns
multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure
representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features
within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive
sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby
reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments
across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared
to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering
memory requirements. The code will be publicly available at

Conclusion: 提出的优化框架通过结合MPPI算法和Dreamer模块，实现了四足机器人在连续步态空间中的实时步态适应，显著降低了能耗并保持了精确的跟踪能力。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile
quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait,
leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but
lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these
limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation
in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for
quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and
gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking,
energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt
gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward,
extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our
framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction
of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while
maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.

Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic

scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from
sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with
limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided

real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes
manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory
diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human
demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an
attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to
successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory
diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments
generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning.
Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher
success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines,
while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data
collection. Webpage is available at https://fieldgen.github.io/.

Motivation: 机器学习和模拟在机器人技术中取得了显著进展，但模拟与现实环境之间的差距（现实差距）阻碍了系统从模拟到现实的成功转移。

Method: 通过综述现有文献，本文分析了领域随机化、真实到模拟转移、状态和动作抽象以及模拟-现实协同训练等技术。

Abstract: Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various
robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such
achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical
tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in
real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and
approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and
real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly
hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.
Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.
Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results
across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.
By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,
state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have
overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper
understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In
this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape,
highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap
and sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian
Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with
robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data
collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual

Motivation: 解决机器人导航中学习策略泛化与具体机器人形态约束之间的矛盾。

Method: VAMOS采用分层视觉语言动作模型（VLA），将语义规划与具体机器人形态的接地解耦。通用规划器从多样化的开放世界数据中学习，而专用可及性模型在低成本仿真中学习机器人的物理约束和能力。

Result: VAMOS在室内和复杂室外导航中的成功率高于现有基于模型和端到端学习方法，并支持跨形态（腿式和轮式）导航，且可通过自然语言引导。

Conclusion: VAMOS通过分层设计实现了跨机器人形态的导航，显著提高了单机器人的可靠性，并在复杂环境中取得了更高的成功率。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that
generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical
constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can
walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that
decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner
learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model
learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost
simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that
lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that
the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments
show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex
outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning
methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied
navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using
natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key
to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed
across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model
significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success
rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:

TL;DR: 论文研究了稀疏图中的电话广播问题，证明了其在$k$-环和$k$-路径图上的NP难解性，提出了PTAS，并展示了在带宽有界图上的多项式时间可解性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏图中电话广播问题的计算复杂性未解问题，并改进现有近似因子。

Method: 通过理论证明和算法设计，研究了电话广播问题在稀疏图中的计算复杂性和近似解法。

Result: 证明了$k$-环和$k$-路径图上的NP难解性，提出了PTAS，并展示了在带宽有界图上的多项式时间可解性。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了在稀疏图家族中，电话广播问题在$k$-环和$k$-路径图上是NP难解的，并提出了多项式时间近似方案（PTAS），同时指出在带宽有界的图上该问题可在多项式时间内解决。

Abstract: We study the Telephone Broadcasting problem in sparse graphs. Given a
designated source in an undirected graph, the task is to disseminate a message
to all vertices in the minimum number of rounds, where in each round every
informed vertex may inform at most one uninformed neighbor. For general graphs
with $n$ vertices, the problem is NP-hard. Recent work shows that the problem
remains NP-hard even on restricted graph classes such as cactus graphs of
pathwidth $2$ [Aminian et al., ICALP 2025] and graphs at distance-1 to a path
forest [Egami et al., MFCS 2025].
  In this work, we investigate the problem in several sparse graph families. We
first prove NP-hardness for $k$-cycle graphs, namely graphs formed by $k$
cycles sharing a single vertex, as well as $k$-path graphs, namely graphs
formed by $k$ paths with shared endpoints. Despite multiple efforts to
understand the problem in these simple graph families, the computational
complexity of the problem had remained unsettled, and our hardness results
answer open questions by Bhabak and Harutyunyan [CALDAM 2015] and Harutyunyan
and Hovhannisyan [COCAO 2023] concerning the problem's complexity in $k$-cycle
and $k$-path graphs, respectively.
  On the positive side, we present Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes
(PTASs) for $k$-cycle and $k$-path graphs, improving over the best existing
approximation factors of $2$ for $k$-cycle graphs and an approximation factor
of $4$ for $k$-path graphs. Moreover, we identify a structural frontier for
tractability by showing that the problem is solvable in polynomial time on
graphs of bounded bandwidth. This result generalizes existing tractability
results for special sparse families such as necklace graphs.

Motivation: 尽管并行连接树在理论上是高效的，但其I/O访问模式的效率问题尚未得到充分研究，尤其是缺乏严格的I/O成本界限。

Method: 引入Fork-Join I/O模型来衡量并行环境中的I/O效率，并基于B树提出新的并行算法。

Result: 算法在I/O工作量和I/O跨度上表现出色，分别为$O(m \log_B(n/m))$和$O(\log_B m \cdot \log_2 \log_B n + \log_B n)$。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的并行算法，基于B树的连接框架，用于高效计算集合操作（如并集、交集和差集），并在Fork-Join I/O模型中提供了严格的I/O成本保证。

Abstract: Balanced search trees are widely used in computer science to efficiently
maintain dynamic ordered data. To support efficient set operations (e.g.,
union, intersection, difference) using trees, the join-based framework is
widely studied. This framework has received particular attention in the
parallel setting, and has been shown to be effective in enabling simple and
theoretically efficient set operations on trees. Despite the widespread
adoption of parallel join-based trees, a major drawback of previous work on
such data structures is the inefficiency of their input/output (I/O) access
patterns. Some recent work (e.g., C-trees and PaC-trees) focused on more
I/O-friendly implementations of these algorithms. Surprisingly, however, there
have been no results on bounding the I/O-costs for these algorithms. It remains
open whether these algorithms can provide tight, provable guarantees in
I/O-costs on trees.
  This paper studies efficient parallel algorithms for set operations based on
search tree algorithms using a join-based framework, with a special focus on
achieving I/O efficiency in these algorithms. To better capture the
I/O-efficiency in these algorithms in parallel, we introduce a new
computational model, Fork-Join I/O Model, to measure the I/O costs in fork-join
parallelism. This model measures the total block transfers (I/O work) and their
critical path (I/O span). Under this model, we propose our new solution based
on B-trees. Our parallel algorithm computes the union, intersection, and
difference of two B-trees with $O(m \log_B(n/m))$ I/O work and $O(\log_B m
\cdot \log_2 \log_B n + \log_B n)$ I/O span, where $n$ and $m \leq n$ are the
sizes of the two trees, and $B$ is the block size.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效算法，用于两阶段二分图匹配问题，在顶点和边加权图中分别达到7/8和0.828的近似比，并扩展至样本访问分布的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决两阶段二分图匹配问题中最大化组合匹配总权重的挑战，特别是在顶点加权和边加权图下的近似优化。

Method: 设计了一种基于分数匹配舍入的算法，通过负关联性（NA）推导新的下界，并扩展至样本访问分布的场景。

Result: 在顶点加权图中达到7/8近似比，在边加权图中达到约0.828近似比，且通过样本访问分布时仍能保持近似性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种多项式时间近似算法，用于两阶段二分图匹配问题，分别在顶点加权和边加权图中达到了7/8和约0.828的近似比，改进了先前的最佳近似比0.767。通过利用依赖舍入引入的负关联性，论文还扩展了结果到仅通过样本访问分布的情况。

Abstract: We study two-stage bipartite matching, in which the edges of a bipartite
graph on vertices $(B_1 \cup B_2, I)$ are revealed in two batches. In stage
one, a matching must be selected from among revealed edges $E \subseteq B_1
\times I$. In stage two, edges $E^\theta \subseteq B_2 \times I$ are sampled
from a known distribution, and a second matching must be selected between $B_2$
and unmatched vertices in $I$. The objective is to maximize the total weight of
the combined matching. We design polynomial-time approximations to the optimum
online algorithm, achieving guarantees of $7/8$ for vertex-weighted graphs and
$2\sqrt{2}-2 \approx 0.828$ for edge-weighted graphs under arbitrary
distributions. Both approximation ratios match known upper bounds on the
integrality gap of the natural fractional relaxation, improving upon the
best-known approximation of 0.767 by Feng, Niazadeh, and Saberi for unweighted
graphs whose second batch consists of independently arriving nodes.
  Our results are obtained via an algorithm that rounds a fractional matching
revealed in two stages, aiming to match offline nodes (respectively, edges)
with probability proportional to their fractional weights, up to a
constant-factor loss. We leverage negative association (NA) among offline node
availabilities -- a property induced by dependent rounding -- to derive new
lower bounds on the expected size of the maximum weight matching in random
graphs where one side is realized via NA binary random variables. Moreover, we
extend these results to settings where we have only sample access to the
distribution. In particular, $\text{poly}(n,\epsilon^{-1})$ samples suffice to
obtain an additive loss of $\epsilon$ in the approximation ratio for the
vertex-weighted problem; a similar bound holds for the edge-weighted problem
with an additional (unavoidable) dependence on the scale of edge weights.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线度量匹配问题在欧几里得度量空间中的表现，特别是当服务器是敌对且请求来自不同分布时。

Method: 通过绕过概率度量嵌入的Ω(log n)障碍，直接分析目标度量上的算法成本，并结合欧几里得度量的离线最优下界。

Result: 提出了一个O(1)-竞争算法，适用于d≠2的情况，仅需每个请求分布的一个样本。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种在欧几里得度量空间中的在线度量匹配问题的O(1)-竞争算法，适用于非i.i.d.设置，且无需先验分布知识。

Abstract: In the online metric matching problem, $n$ servers and $n$ requests lie in a
metric space. Servers are available upfront, and requests arrive sequentially.
An arriving request must be matched immediately and irrevocably to an available
server, incurring a cost equal to their distance. The goal is to minimize the
total matching cost.
  We study this problem in the Euclidean metric $[0, 1]^d$, when servers are
adversarial and requests are independently drawn from distinct distributions
that satisfy a mild smoothness condition. Our main result is an
$O(1)$-competitive algorithm for $d \neq 2$ that requires no distributional
knowledge, relying only on a single sample from each request distribution. To
our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to achieve an $o(\log n)$
competitive ratio for non-trivial metrics beyond the i.i.d. setting. Our
approach bypasses the $\Omega(\log n)$ barrier introduced by probabilistic
metric embeddings: instead of analyzing the embedding distortion and the
algorithm separately, we directly bound the cost of the algorithm on the target
metric of a simple deterministic embedding. We then combine this analysis with
lower bounds on the offline optimum for Euclidean metrics, derived via
majorization arguments, to obtain our guarantees.

TL;DR: 本文首次在自然动态图问题中，基于细粒度复杂性假设，证明了动态算法在遗忘型与自适应型对手间存在指数级更新时间分离，并展示了增量与减量算法在三角形检测中的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态算法在遗忘型对手和自适应型对手之间的性能差异，填补现有分离问题在自然问题中的空白。

Method: 通过组合BMM假设，证明了增量最大独立集问题中对抗自适应对手的组合算法需要n^(1-o(1))的摊销更新时间。同时，假设3SUM或APSP假设，证明了在初始最大度Δ≤√n时，减量最大团问题的任何算法都需要Δ/n^(o(1))的摊销更新时间。

Result: 本文的分离结果达到了指数级，且与现有对抗自适应对手的算法匹配。此外，还首次展示了增量与减量算法在三角形检测问题中的性能差异。

Conclusion: 本文首次在自然动态图问题中，基于细粒度复杂性假设，建立了动态算法针对遗忘型对手和自适应型对手之间的更新时间分离。

Abstract: We establish the first update-time separation between dynamic algorithms
against oblivious adversaries and those against adaptive adversaries in natural
dynamic graph problems, based on popular fine-grained complexity hypotheses.
Specifically, under the combinatorial BMM hypothesis, we show that every
combinatorial algorithm against an adaptive adversary for the incremental
maximal independent set problem requires $n^{1-o(1)}$ amortized update time.
Furthermore, assuming either the 3SUM or APSP hypotheses, every algorithm for
the decremental maximal clique problem needs $\Delta/n^{o(1)}$ amortized update
time when the initial maximum degree is $\Delta \le \sqrt{n}$. These lower
bounds are matched by existing algorithms against adaptive adversaries. In
contrast, both problems admit algorithms against oblivious adversaries that
achieve $\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ amortized update time [Behnezhad,
Derakhshan, Hajiaghayi, Stein, Sudan; FOCS '19] [Chechik, Zhang; FOCS '19].
Therefore, our separations are exponential. Previously known separations for
dynamic algorithms were either engineered for contrived problems and relied on
strong cryptographic assumptions [Beimel, Kaplan, Mansour, Nissim, Saranurak,
Stemmer; STOC '22], or worked for problems whose inputs are not explicitly
given but are accessed through oracle calls [Bateni, Esfandiari, Fichtenberger,
Henzinger, Jayaram, Mirrokni, Wiese; SODA '23].
  As a byproduct, we also provide a separation between incremental and
decremental algorithms for the triangle detection problem: we show a
decremental algorithm with $\tilde{O}(n^{\omega})$ total update time, while
every incremental algorithm requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ total update time, assuming
the OMv hypothesis. To our knowledge this is the first separation of this kind.

Motivation: 解决现有$k$稀疏近似算法在运行时间和效率上的不足，尤其是在处理大规模数据时的时间复杂度问题。

Method: 采用了一种称为加权超图剥离（weighted hypergraph peeling）的新技术，将已知的超图剥离过程扩展到边和节点具有（可能相关）权重的设置。

Result: 提出的算法在$O((k/\epsilon) \log n)$时间内实现了$(1+\epsilon)$因子近似，运行时间比现有最快算法[Nakos, Song; STOC '19]提高了$\log n$倍，且在多种参数下达到最优。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新方法，能够在$O((k/\epsilon) \log n)$时间内恢复长度-$n$向量的最佳$k$稀疏近似，且具有$(1+\epsilon)$因子近似。该方法不仅运行时间优于现有最快算法，而且在多种参数下达到最优。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the best $k$-sparse approximation of a length-$n$ vector
can be recovered within a $(1+\epsilon)$-factor approximation in
$O((k/\epsilon) \log n)$ time using a non-adaptive linear sketch with
$O((k/\epsilon) \log n)$ rows and $O(\log n)$ column sparsity. This improves
the running time of the fastest-known sketch [Nakos, Song; STOC '19] by a
factor of $\log n$, and is optimal for a wide range of parameters.
  Our algorithm is simple and likely to be practical, with the analysis built
on a new technique we call weighted hypergraph peeling. Our method naturally
extends known hypergraph peeling processes (as in the analysis of Invertible
Bloom Filters) to a setting where edges and nodes have (possibly correlated)
weights.

Motivation: 为了解决结构化网络中最大流问题的计算效率问题，尤其是在强多项式时间内的性能提升。

Method: 通过开发一个通用框架，将任意容量的最大流问题转化为一系列多项式有界容量的最大流问题，并动态维护一个大小有界的超集（称为增量传递覆盖）。此外，结合最新的弱多项式算法和增量传递覆盖数据结构。

Result: 实现了$n^{\omega + o(1)}$时间的强多项式算法用于计算最大二分$b$-匹配，以及$m^{1 + o(1)} W$时间的算法用于具有给定树分解宽度的图。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种更快的强多项式时间算法来解决结构化网络中的最大流问题，并通过加强和有效实施Orlin的方法，实现了一个通用框架，将任意容量的最大流问题转化为一系列多项式有界容量的最大流问题。

Abstract: We provide faster strongly polynomial time algorithms solving maximum flow in
structured $n$-node $m$-arc networks. Our results imply an $n^{\omega +
o(1)}$-time strongly polynomial time algorithms for computing a maximum
bipartite $b$-matching where $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication constant.
Additionally, they imply an $m^{1 + o(1)} W$-time algorithm for solving the
problem on graphs with a given tree decomposition of width $W$.
  We obtain these results by strengthening and efficiently implementing an
approach in Orlin's (STOC 2013) state-of-the-art $O(mn)$ time maximum flow
algorithm. We develop a general framework that reduces solving maximum flow
with arbitrary capacities to (1) solving a sequence of maximum flow problems
with polynomial bounded capacities and (2) dynamically maintaining a
size-bounded supersets of the transitive closure under arc additions; we call
this problem \emph{incremental transitive cover}. Our applications follow by
leveraging recent weakly polynomial, almost linear time algorithms for maximum
flow due to Chen, Kyng, Liu, Peng, Gutenberg, Sachdeva (FOCS 2022) and Brand,
Chen, Kyng, Liu, Peng, Gutenberg, Sachdeva, Sidford (FOCS 2023), and by
developing incremental transitive cover data structures.

Method: 设计了一种数据结构，使用渐近最优的O(n lg s_π)比特存储模式避免排列，支持τ(i)和τ⁻¹(i)的O(1)时间查询，并扩展支持矩形范围计数等几何查询。

Result: 数据结构在时间和空间复杂度上优于现有方法，支持更广泛的查询类型，并在特定排列类（如有界树宽排列）中进一步优化空间。

Conclusion: 本文设计了一种数据结构，能够以渐近最优的空间存储模式避免排列，并支持高效的查询操作，同时扩展到支持更复杂的几何查询。

Abstract: Pattern-avoiding permutations are a central object of study in both
combinatorics and theoretical computer science. In this paper we design a data
structure that can store any size-$n$ permutation $\tau$ that avoids an
arbitrary (and unknown) fixed pattern $\pi$ in the asymptotically optimal $O(n
\lg{s_\pi})$ bits, where $s_\pi$ is the Stanley-Wilf limit of $\pi$. Our data
structure supports $\tau(i)$ and $\tau^{-1}(i)$ queries in $O(1)$ time,
sidestepping the lower bound of Golynski (SODA 2009) that holds for general
permutations. Comparable results were previously known only in more restricted
cases, e.g., when $\tau$ is separable, which means avoiding the patterns 2413
and 3142.
  We also extend our data structure to support more complex geometric queries
on pattern-avoiding permutations (or planar point sets) such as rectangle range
counting in $O(\lg\lg{n})$ time. This result circumvents the lower bound of
$\Omega{(\lg{n}/\lg\lg{n})}$ by P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu (STOC 2007) that holds in the
general case. For bounded treewidth permutation classes (which include the
above-mentioned separable class), we further reduce the space overhead to a
lower order additive term, making our data structure succinct. This extends and
improves results of Chakraborty et al. (ISAAC 2024) that were obtained for
separable permutations via different techniques. All our data structures can be
constructed in linear time.

Abstract: We present a parallel algorithm for computing $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
mincost flow on an undirected graph with $m$ edges, where capacities and costs
are assigned to both edges and vertices. Our algorithm achieves $\hat{O}(m)$
work and $\hat{O}(1)$ depth when $\epsilon > 1/\mathrm{polylog}(m)$, making
both the work and depth almost optimal, up to a subpolynomial factor.
  Previous algorithms with $\hat{O}(m)$ work required $\Omega(m)$ depth, even
for special cases of mincost flow with only edge capacities or max flow with
vertex capacities. Our result generalizes prior almost-optimal parallel
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for these special cases, including
shortest paths [Li, STOC'20] [Andoni, Stein, Zhong, STOC'20] [Rozhen, Haeupler,
Marinsson, Grunau, Zuzic, STOC'23] and max flow with only edge capacities
[Agarwal, Khanna, Li, Patil, Wang, White, Zhong, SODA'24].
  Our key technical contribution is the first construction of
length-constrained flow shortcuts with $(1+\epsilon)$ length slack,
$\hat{O}(1)$ congestion slack, and $\hat{O}(1)$ step bound. This provides a
strict generalization of the influential concept of
$(\hat{O}(1),\epsilon)$-hopsets [Cohen, JACM'00], allowing for additional
control over congestion. Previous length-constrained flow shortcuts [Haeupler,
Hershkowitz, Li, Roeyskoe, Saranurak, STOC'24] incur a large constant in the
length slack, which would lead to a large approximation factor. To enable our
flow algorithms to work under vertex capacities, we also develop a
close-to-linear time algorithm for computing length-constrained vertex expander
decomposition.
  Building on Cohen's idea of path-count flows [Cohen, SICOMP'95], we further
extend our algorithm to solve $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate $k$-commodity mincost
flow problems with almost-optimal $\hat{O}(mk)$ work and $\hat{O}(1)$ depth,
independent of the number of commodities $k$.

Motivation: 多目标现实问题（如设施选址和公交路线）在优化多个利益相关者的优先级时变得更加复杂。传统方法通过显式平衡“公平”和“效率”目标来捕捉这种权衡，但由此得到的解决方案结构可能差异很大。

Method: 论文提出了两种可证明的算法来构建组合：一种针对锥组合类，另一种针对任何在最小和效率目标与最小最大公平目标之间单调插值的函数类。应用方面，研究了公平补贴设施选址问题（FSFL），并开发了一种新颖的双标准近似算法。

Result: 通过构建组合，论文展示了如何在不同目标函数类中提供近似解。在FSFL问题的应用中，显著减少了美国各州的医疗荒漠现象。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种称为“组合”的小型解决方案集概念，能够在给定目标函数类中为每个函数提供α近似解。通过这种方法，决策者可以更好地理解多目标平衡的影响。

Abstract: Many multiobjective real-world problems, such as facility location and bus
routing, become more complex when optimizing the priorities of multiple
stakeholders. These are often modeled using infinite classes of objectives,
e.g., $L_p$ norms over group distances induced by feasible solutions in a fixed
domain. Traditionally, the literature has considered explicitly balancing
`equity' (or min-max) and `efficiency' (or min-sum) objectives to capture this
trade-off. However, the structure of solutions obtained by such modeling
choices can be very different. Taking a solution-centric approach, we introduce
the concept of provably small set of solutions $P$, called a {\it portfolio},
such that for every objective function $h(\cdot)$ in the given class
$\mathbf{C}$, there exists some solution in $P$ which is an
$\alpha$-approximation for $h(\cdot)$. Constructing such portfolios can help
decision-makers understand the impact of balancing across multiple objectives.
  Given a finite set of base objectives $h_1, \ldots, h_N$, we give provable
algorithms for constructing portfolios for (1) the class of conic combinations
$\mathbf{C} = \{\sum_{j \in [N]}\lambda_j h_j: \lambda \ge 0\}$ and for (2) any
class $\mathbf{C}$ of functions that interpolates monotonically between the
min-sum efficiency objective (i.e., $h_1 + \ldots + h_N$) and the min-max
equity objective (i.e., $\max_{j \in [N]} h_j$). Examples of the latter are
$L_p$ norms and top-$\ell$ norms. As an application, we study the Fair
Subsidized Facility Location (FSFL) problem, motivated by the crisis of medical
deserts caused due to pharmacy closures. FSFL allows subsidizing facilities in
underserved areas using revenue from profitable locations. We develop a novel
bicriteria approximation algorithm and show a significant reduction of medical
deserts across states in the U.S.

*Marc Dufay,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种O(log^5 m)-竞争力的确定性算法，解决了在线MPMD问题，显著提升了现有结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在度量空间无限或未知时表现不佳，竞争力远低于下界，需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种不需要预先知道度量空间或请求数量的确定性算法。

Result: 新算法的竞争力为O(log^5 m)，显著优于之前的O(m^0.59)，且接近下界Ω(log m / log log m)。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种确定性算法，解决了在线最小成本完美匹配延迟（MPMD）问题，其竞争力为O(log^5 m)，相较于之前的结果有指数级提升，且接近下界。

Abstract: In the online Min-cost Perfect Matching with Delays (MPMD) problem, $m$
requests in a metric space are submitted at different times by an adversary.
The goal is to match all requests while (i) minimizing the sum of the distances
between matched pairs as well as (ii) how long each request remained unmatched
after it appeared.
  While there exist almost optimal algorithms when the metric space is finite
and known a priori, this is not the case when the metric space is infinite or
unknown. In this latter case, the best known algorithm, due to Azar and
Jacob-Fanani, has competitiveness $\mathcal{O}(m^{0.59})$ which is
exponentially worse than the best known lower bound of $\Omega(\log m / \log
\log m)$ by Ashlagi et al.
  We present a $\mathcal{O}(\log^5 m)$-competitive algorithm for the MPMD
problem. This algorithm is deterministic and does not need to know the metric
space or $m$ in advance. This is an exponential improvement over previous
results and only a polylogarithmic factor away from the lower bound.
