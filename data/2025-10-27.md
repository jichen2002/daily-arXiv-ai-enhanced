### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training，通过提供捷径避免适配器纠缠目标与偶然属性，显著提升生成质量与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器训练方法容易将目标属性与偶然属性（如姿势、表情和光照）纠缠，限制了泛化能力并阻碍模型遵循输入文本提示的能力。

Method: 在Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training中，混淆因素通过辅助模块（如ControlNet或LoRA）路由，消除了适配器内部化的动机，并在推理时移除这些模块。

Result: 应用于面部和全身身份注入等任务时，该方法显著提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种简单而有效的解决方案，即在适配器训练过程中提供我们希望消除的捷径，从而改善生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [ArtiLatent: Realistic Articulated 3D Object Generation via Structured Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21432)
*Honghua Chen,Yushi Lan,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtiLatent通过联合建模几何和关节动态，结合潜在扩散和高斯解码器，实现了高保真3D物体合成，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在合成具有精细几何、准确关节和逼真外观的人造3D物体，解决现有方法在几何一致性和外观逼真度上的不足。

Method: 通过变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间，并利用潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样。引入基于关节状态的高斯解码器以重建逼真3D形状。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观逼真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ArtiLatent提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，用于3D物体的合成和操作，显著提升了几何一致性和外观逼真度。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [3] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAP提出了一种新范式，通过参考视频作为语义提示，结合冻结DiT和MoT专家，实现了通用可控视频生成，并在性能上达到商业模型水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成方法中存在的通用性不足、依赖特定条件微调或任务特定架构的问题。

Method: VAP利用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过plug-and-play的Mixture-of-Transformers专家引导冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer，并采用时间偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验。

Result: VAP在开源方法中取得了新的最先进水平，用户偏好率达到38.7%，与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美。

Conclusion: VAP通过引入Video-As-Prompt范式，显著推进了通用可控视频生成的发展，其零样本泛化能力和多下游应用支持展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [4] [Group Inertial Poser: Multi-Person Pose and Global Translation from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21654)
*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 Group Inertial Poser 方法，结合 IMU 和 UWB 进行多人体运动捕捉，优于现有方法，并发布首个相关数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服基于视觉方法的遮挡和环境仪器限制，解决纯 IMU 方法的自引用局限，无法提供直接空间参考的问题。

Method: 通过超宽带测距（UWB）估计传感器之间的绝对距离，并将其与惯性观测结合，输入结构化状态空间模型，利用时间运动模式进行精确的3D姿态估计。采用新颖的两步优化方法，利用估计的距离准确跟踪全球轨迹。

Result: Group Inertial Poser 在准确性和鲁棒性上优于现有最先进方法，并引入了首个 IMU+UWB 双人跟踪数据集 GIP-DB。

Conclusion: Group Inertial Poser 方法在合成和真实世界数据中均表现出色，展示了 IMU+UWB 结合在多人体运动捕捉中的潜力。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

### [5] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-BFF-Net结合卷积和Transformer，通过焦点调制和双向特征融合提升医学图像分割精度，实验证明其在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床决策至关重要，但传统卷积神经网络在捕获全局上下文和长程依赖关系方面存在局限，影响对复杂边界和多样化尺寸结构的精确分割。

Method: 提出了FM-BFF-Net，结合卷积和Transformer架构，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，并引入双向特征融合模块促进编码器和解码器跨尺度表示的高效交互。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上的实验显示，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上 consistently 超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过结合卷积和Transformer组件，采用焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，显著提升了医学图像分割的边界精度和对病变大小、形状及对比度变化的鲁棒性。在多个公开数据集上的实验证明了其优越性和适应性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [6] [WorldGrow: Generating Infinite 3D World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21682)
*Sikuang Li,Chen Yang,Jiemin Fang,Taoran Yi,Jia Lu,Jiazhong Cen,Lingxi Xie,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldGrow通过分层框架和预训练3D模型先验，解决了无限3D场景生成的挑战，实现了高质量的几何重建和无限扩展能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成无限扩展的3D世界时面临几何和外观不一致、难以扩展或仅限于对象中心生成等挑战，WorldGrow旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 该方法包括三个核心组件：(1) 数据整理流程提取高质量场景块用于训练；(2) 3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；(3) 从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到SOTA性能，并支持生成具有照片级真实感和结构一致性的无限场景。

Conclusion: WorldGrow 提出了一种分层框架，用于无限扩展的3D场景合成，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，实现了在几何重建和无限场景生成方面的最先进性能。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一种生成式框架，用于建模多模态点轨迹，通过流匹配训练和最佳优先搜索策略，在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中点的跟踪由于视觉遮挡（如外观变化和遮挡）带来的不确定性具有挑战性，现有判别式模型无法捕捉多模态性。

Method: GenPT采用了一种新颖的流匹配框架，结合了判别式跟踪器的迭代细化、跨窗口一致性的窗口依赖先验以及针对点坐标调整的方差计划。

Result: GenPT在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别是在遮挡点跟踪上，展示了捕捉多模态性的能力。

Conclusion: GenPT通过生成多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪上达到了最先进的准确性，同时在可见点跟踪上保持与现有判别式点跟踪器相当的竞争力。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DReasonKnee是首个支持3D医学影像‘基于推理的定位’的数据集，包含494k高质量五元组，推动了多模态医学AI系统的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在3D医学影像中难以定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这是真实世界诊断评估的关键要求。现有3D数据集仅提供定位标签，不支持这种‘基于推理的定位’能力。

Method: 研究者引入了3DReasonKnee数据集，该数据集包含来自7,970个3D膝关节MRI的494k高质量五元组，每个五元组包括3D MRI体积、诊断问题、3D边界框、临床生成的诊断推理步骤和结构化严重性评估。

Result: 通过创建和验证3DReasonKnee数据集，研究者建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估定位和诊断准确性，并评估了五种最先进的VLMs，提供了基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee数据集填补了现有3D医学影像数据在‘基于推理的定位’能力上的空白，为多模态医学AI系统提供了一个重要的测试平台，推动了其向3D、临床对齐的定位决策能力发展。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状重建方法依赖光照和材料属性，限制了其在透明、半透明和异质物体上的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 论文首先建立了偏振观测的通用理论，证明了长波红外（LWIR）偏振成像不受可见光偏振分析中模糊性的影响。随后，提出了一种利用多视角热偏振图像恢复详细3D形状的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于热偏振线索的3D形状重建新方法，该方法不依赖光照和材料属性，能够有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的无标注自监督适应方法，通过多视角对象观测提升视觉基础模型在分布偏移领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺领域性能不足的问题，无需标注即可适应新领域。

Method: VESSA采用自蒸馏训练范式，结合参数高效的适应技术，通过多视角对象观测学习鲁棒性，避免遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中表现优于基础模型和现有适应方法。

Conclusion: VESSA通过自蒸馏范式和无标注的多视角对象中心视频，成功实现了视觉基础模型的自监督微调，显著提升了在分布偏移和标注稀缺领域的性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对工业环境中未见物体的标准化2D检测流水线，通过低光增强和背景去除提升检测精度，实验证明其有效且实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流水线在复杂环境下（如杂乱、光照不足、复杂背景）性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要一种标准化且即插即用的2D检测方法。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，通过低光图像增强和背景去除（利用开放词汇检测的基础模型）来减少领域偏移和背景干扰，抑制了原始SAM输出中的误报。

Result: 在BOP的真实工业分拣基准测试中，该方法显著提升了检测精度，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实工业场景中显著提升了检测精度，同时保持了较低的推理开销，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要。本研究旨在利用深度学习方法检测混凝土建筑和桥梁中的裸露钢筋，以评估结构损伤状况。

Method: 研究提出了一种基于深度学习框架的方法，包括数据增强、微调以及在公共数据集上的测试。开发了一个自动化分类框架，用于识别建筑物内外及结构组件。随后，训练了YOLOv11模型检测裂缝、剥落和裸露钢筋，并微调了另一个YOLO模型以区分不同类别的结构损伤等级。

Result: 研究开发了一个混合框架，能够自动可靠地从输入图像中确定损伤等级。

Conclusion: 该研究证明，通过结合图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，能够实现灾后快速自动化的结构损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有 3D 场景图生成方法在单视角设置、增量更新和 3D 几何基础方面的局限性，以支持具身场景的需求。

Method: 结合 VLM 推理生成丰富的 2D 场景图，并通过深度信息将其在 3D 空间中定位，节点表示开放词汇对象及其特征、3D 位置和语义上下文，边捕捉空间和语义关系。

Result: 在 Replica 和 HM3D 数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D 无需任务特定训练即可有效捕获空间和关系知识。

Conclusion: ZING-3D 框架通过利用预训练基础模型的广泛知识，实现了开放词汇识别和丰富的场景语义表示，无需任务特定训练，适用于机器人应用。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial

TL;DR: WaveSeg是一种新型解码器架构，通过空间和小波域联合优化特征，结合Mamba的长程建模和重参数化卷积，显著提升了语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义分割网络过于依赖强大的预训练编码器，而解码器设计简单，导致语义上下文和细节保留之间的权衡不佳。

Method: 提出了一种新型解码器架构WaveSeg，包括高频组件学习、多尺度融合机制Dual Domain Operation（DDO）、Spectrum Decomposition Attention（SDA）块以及重参数化卷积。

Result: WaveSeg在标准基准测试中定量和定性均优于现有方法，实现了高效且精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过结合空间和小波域的特征优化，利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模和重参数化卷积，在多个标准基准测试中表现优异，实现了高效且精确的分割。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在诊断Hirschsprung病时作为黑箱的问题，并使其更符合医生的决策方式。

Method: 通过整合专家来源的文本概念到一个基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉-语言模型中，引导神经丛分类。

Result: 提出的模型在准确率（83.9%）、精确率（86.6%）和特异性（87.6%）上均优于CNN模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种结合专家知识的多模态学习框架，显著提升了Hirschsprung病的诊断准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），用于快速低光图像增强，显著提升了处理速度和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Retinex-based低光图像增强方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时较长，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，定义了直方图位置矩阵和计数矩阵，构建了一个两级优化模型，并通过迭代公式求解光照和反射直方图。

Result: HistRetinex在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒，比现有方法节省至少6.67秒，同时在视觉效果和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HistRetinex模型在低光图像增强中表现出色，不仅在视觉效果上优于现有方法，而且在处理速度上显著提升，适用于大尺寸图像的快速增强。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的信息往往不完整，而人类通过主动探索和交互来获取信息。现有视觉推理模型在静态、完全可观察的环境中的局限性促使研究者探索部分可观察、交互式环境中的视觉推理。

Method: 引入了Active Visual Reasoning (AVR)任务和CLEVR-AVR仿真基准，开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型，并利用AVR-152k数据集进行训练。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，但现有模型在主动获取和整合信息方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: PhysVLM-AVR模型在CLEVR-AVR、OpenEQA、RoboVQA等基准测试中表现出色，但当前的多模态大语言模型在主动获取和整合信息方面仍存在不足。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 高精3D城市地图对智能交通、数字孪生和自动驾驶至关重要，但现有方法对小垂直偏差、地面坡度和视角不匹配敏感，且缺乏对象身份一致性。

Method: 提出了一种面向城市规模LiDAR的对象中心化、不确定性感知流程，包括多分辨率NDT对齐、点对平面ICP、高度归一化，并通过注册协方差和表面粗糙度校准决策。

Result: 在15个Subiaco区块上，方法实现了95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，性能优于Triplet KPConv。

Conclusion: 该方法在15个代表性Subiaco区块上实现了95.2%的准确率、90.4%的mF1和82.6%的mIoU，性能优于Triplet KPConv，尤其在Decreased类别上IoU提升了7.6个百分点。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE方法通过动态控制局部先验，有效提升了大规模基础模型在特定分割任务中的细粒度感知能力，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集粗粒度且模糊，无法区分驱动安全差异的特定特征。

Method: 通过图像编辑模型生成反事实图像对，这些图像仅在安全相关特征上有差异，从而改变其安全标签。

Result: 构建了一个包含3,020个SafetyPair图像的新安全基准，覆盖9个安全类别，揭示了视觉语言模型在区分细微图像差异上的弱点。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs框架提供了一个系统化的方法来研究和区分图像安全性的细微差别，为视觉语言模型的评估和轻量级防护模型的训练提供了有效的数据支持。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升通用链式推理（CoT）能力时，难以超越训练分布的泛化能力，需要更系统的多模态RL框架。

Method: 提出了NoisyGRPO框架，包括噪声注入探索策略和贝叶斯优势估计，通过高斯噪声扰动视觉输入并建模优势估计过程。

Result: 实验表明，NoisyGRPO在CoT质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中显著提升了泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过引入可控噪声和贝叶斯优势估计，显著提升了多模态大型语言模型在强化学习中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模模型如Qwen2.5-VL 3B上表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA依赖碘对比剂，可能引发肾毒性和过敏反应，尤其对高风险患者。本研究旨在通过生成数字对比图像减少这些风险。

Method: 采用基于Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN)的级联合成器，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA图像。

Result: 在验证集和测试集上，该方法在定量指标（MAE、PSNR、SSIM）和定性可视化上均优于现有方法，且在下游任务（血管分割和定量分析）中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的基于CycleGAN的DCCTPA方法在无需碘对比剂的情况下，显著提升了非对比CT扫描的图像质量，有效增强了血管结构，并在下游临床任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Motivation: 当前实践中，视觉空间智能（VSI）常通过纯文本提示和VQA风格评分来代理，这种方法掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，并削弱了对真正空间技能的归因。

Method: 研究者引入了SIG，一种结构化、基于网格的模式，明确编码对象布局、对象间关系和物理基础先验。基于SIG，还开发了SIG-informed评估指标。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG在所有VSI指标上相比仅使用VQA的表示方法，表现出一致性更高、更稳定且更全面的增益。

Conclusion: SIG（空间智能网格）作为一种补充文本的通道，能够更真实、更组合地表示场景结构，为基础模型推理提供了新的方法。通过SIG-informed评估指标，可以量化模型的内在视觉空间智能，从而区分空间能力与语言先验。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Motivation: 传统的Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的显著信号特征，且推理成本高。

Method: BFM将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专门的小型速度块建模，并引入语义特征引导模块和特征残差近似策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，BFM在保持生成性能的同时，显著降低了推理复杂度。

Conclusion: Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM) 通过分块设计和语义特征引导模块，显著提升了生成效率和质量，在ImageNet 256x256上实现了2.1x至4.9x的推理加速。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack是一种专为夜间无人机跟踪设计的多尺度自适应系统，通过三个核心模块解决低光照和复杂背景下的跟踪问题，性能显著优于现有方法，且适用于实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有方法（如低光增强和域适应）存在视觉伪影、计算成本高或难以充分利用动态目标信息等问题，因此需要一种更高效、稳定的解决方案。

Method: MATrack通过三个核心模块协同工作：多尺度层次混合（MHB）增强静态与动态模板的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门（Adaptive Key Token Gate）准确识别复杂背景中的目标信息，以及夜间模板校准器（NTC）确保长时间序列的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，MATrack的精确度、归一化精确度和AUC分别比最先进方法提高了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。

Conclusion: MATrack在夜间无人机跟踪中表现出色，不仅在UAVDark135基准测试中显著超越现有方法，还在实际应用中验证了其可靠性，适用于夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人任务。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Result: 实验表明KBE能有效控制评估难度，避免数据污染和饱和，更全面地评估MLLM能力。

Conclusion: KBE通过动态评估框架有效缓解了数据污染和饱和问题，为MLLM能力提供了更全面的评估。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Motivation: 解决捷径模型的五个核心性能瓶颈，包括复合引导的隐藏缺陷、固定引导的不灵活性、频率偏差、自一致性问题以及曲线流轨迹。

Method: 引入了iSM框架，包括Intrinsic Guidance、Multi-Level Wavelet Loss、Scaling Optimal Transport (sOT)和Twin EMA四项改进。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，iSM显著提升了FID表现，支持一步、少步和多步生成。

Conclusion: iSM框架通过四项关键改进解决了捷径模型的五个核心问题，显著提升了在ImageNet 256x256上的FID表现，使捷径模型成为一类可行且具有竞争力的生成模型。

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSSR的主要动机是实现高精度的令牌预测，并通过并行生成超越传统的顺序自回归方法。

Method: TSSR采用离散扩散模型（DDMs），通过三个关键创新：解耦训练与混合推理、改进的Hourglass架构和新型连接损失，实现了高效的并行生成。

Result: 实验表明，TSSR能够生成高达10,000个面的高质量3D网格，空间分辨率达到1024^3。

Conclusion: TSSR通过其创新的并行生成方法，成功生成了高质量的艺术家风格3D网格，展现了在复杂数据集上的卓越性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为可执行且语义和物理对齐的环境，显著提升了VLN任务的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Conclusion: \textsc{FineRS} 通过两阶段的强化学习框架，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像中对极小目标的识别和分割能力，并在\textsc{FineRS}-4k数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

Result: IMPACT配准在本地测试集上表现优于互信息配准，但在公共验证集上Elastix配准得分更高，反映了配准偏差对评估的影响。

Conclusion: IMPACT-based registration 提供了更准确和解剖学上一致的配准，有助于开发更稳健和可推广的合成CT模型，同时揭示了配准误差对监督学习的影响。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

TL;DR: 提出一种带宽自适应的扩散模型框架，通过联合训练策略调节生成质量，显著提升带宽受限环境下的图像传输效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在固定去噪步骤下生成高保真图像，忽略了实际云到设备场景中带宽限制导致的压缩问题，导致细节丢失和计算浪费。

Method: 引入了一种联合端到端训练策略，扩散模型根据可用带宽的目标质量水平进行调节，学习自适应调制去噪过程，实现早期停止采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比简单的早期停止采样，显著提高了带宽适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过联合端到端训练策略，使扩散模型能够根据实时网络带宽约束调整生成质量，显著提高了带宽受限环境下图像传输的视觉保真度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 本文提出的深度一致性约束无缝图像拼接方法在实验中表现出优于现有方法的性能，且算法效率通过重参数化策略得到显著提升。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言基础视觉概念学习方法局限于预定义的原始轴（如颜色和形状），且通常在合成数据集中探索。

Conclusion: 该框架在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ子集上展示了卓越的编辑能力，能够处理多样化的现实世界概念，且无需手动预定义。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

Motivation: 现有基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法在融合查找结果时采用平均池化，这在处理各向异性信号结构时表现不佳。

Method: 研究了广义中值池化方法，并进一步扩展为学习数据依赖性池化系数，以自适应地权衡不同方向像素块的贡献。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，所提出的各向异性池化策略在感知和数值上均优于现有的基于查找表的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入各向异性池化策略，特别是广义中值池化和学习数据依赖性池化系数，显著提升了现有基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法的性能。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模3D场景层次结构时存在局限性，如推理时间增加或泛化能力差，需一种更高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出OpenHype，采用连续双曲潜在空间表示场景层次结构，通过双曲几何特性自然编码多尺度关系。

Result: OpenHype在标准基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OpenHype利用双曲几何特性，在3D场景理解中表现出更高的效率和适应性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线VAD因实时性和计算强度问题较少受到关注，而离线VAD受益于大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）的进展。MoniTor旨在解决在线VAD的复杂性。

Method: 结合预训练的大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）和受LSTM启发的预测机制，设计了评分队列和异常先验，动态存储近期分数并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上的实验表明，MoniTor优于现有方法，且与无需训练的弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: MoniTor提出了一种基于内存的在线评分队列方案，用于无训练的视频异常检测（VAD），在实时性和计算效率上表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在内容严重退化时表现不佳，且忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后部分的控制不足。

Method: 将视频修复任务解耦为多帧一致的图像修复和掩码区域运动传播两个子任务，设计CoSpliced模块和上下文控制器模块，利用空间帧先验引导修复过程。

Result: VidSplice在多样化的视频修复场景中表现出色，显著提升了前景对齐和运动稳定性。

Conclusion: VidSplice框架通过解耦视频修复任务并引入空间帧先验，显著提升了视频修复的性能，特别是在前景对齐和运动稳定性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC introduces a framework for interpretable chest X-ray diagnosis by decomposing image representations into clinically relevant patterns, balancing accuracy and transparency for safer clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The black-box nature of deep learning predictions limits their clinical adoption, as clinicians require transparent, verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential failure modes.

Method: The approach trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual patterns, using an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings from the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

Result: CXR-LanIC discovers approximately 5,000 monosemantic patterns across various categories, achieving competitive diagnostic accuracy on five key findings while enabling transparent attribution.

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC demonstrates that medical AI systems can achieve both high accuracy and interpretability, supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded explanations.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种双流架构，通过结合宏观组织特征和细胞级特征，显著提升了细粒度病理图像分类的性能，特别是在癌症亚型分类任务中。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),

suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

TL;DR: GranViT是一种新型视觉Transformer，通过细粒度区域级训练和语义对齐，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的视觉语言任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉编码器主要关注全局图像表示，忽略了细粒度的区域分析，导致在细粒度感知上受限。

Method: 提出了GranViT，一种结合细粒度特征提取和语义对齐的视觉Transformer，通过构建Gran-29M数据集进行大规模细粒度预训练，并采用预训练-适应框架及自蒸馏机制。

Result: GranViT超越了现有视觉编码器，并在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解等任务上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GranViT通过精细的区域级自回归训练和语义对齐，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中的表现，并在细粒度识别、多模态VQA和OCR理解等任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 Foresight Guidance (FSG) 作为 Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) 的改进，通过固定点迭代和长间隔子问题优化，显著提升图像质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择，因此需要一种统一的视角来改进 CFG 的操作机制。

Method: 通过将条件引导重新定义为固定点迭代，识别出一条黄金路径，使得潜在变量在条件和非条件生成下都能产生一致的输出。此外，提出了 Foresight Guidance (FSG)，重点解决早期扩散阶段的长间隔子问题，并增加迭代次数。

Result: FSG 在多样数据集和模型架构上的实验验证了其在图像质量和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) 的局限性促使了 Foresight Guidance (FSG) 的提出，后者在图像质量和计算效率上均优于现有方法，为条件引导提供了新视角和自适应设计的潜力。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

TL;DR: 该研究通过信号处理视角分析注意力头的专业化，发现编辑少量注意力头即可控制模型输出，为理解和编辑生成模型提供了新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言和视觉-语言模型在多种任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全明了。本研究旨在探索文本生成模型中单个注意力头如何专门化于特定语义或视觉属性。

Method: 基于信号处理的视角，重新解释了通过最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，并分析了多个样本，根据注意力头与目标概念的相关性进行排名。

Result: 研究结果显示，无论是单模态还是多模态变换器，注意力头层面都存在一致的专业化模式。通过该方法选择并编辑仅1%的注意力头，即可可靠地抑制或增强模型输出中的目标概念。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了注意力层中存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

TL;DR: Foley Control 通过小型交叉注意力桥连接冻结的视频和音频模型，实现视频引导的 Foley，保持高效和模块化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在无需重新训练音频先验的情况下，实现视频和音频的同步，同时保持预训练模型的强大边际性能。

Method: 该方法通过将 V-JEPA2 视频嵌入连接到冻结的 Stable Audio Open DiT 文本到音频（T2A）模型，插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力，以视频细化时间和局部动态。为减少内存并稳定训练，对视频令牌进行池化处理。

Result: Foley Control 在视频音频基准测试中表现出竞争性的时间和语义对齐，且训练参数远少于最近的多模态系统。

Conclusion: Foley Control 是一种轻量级方法，通过保持预训练的单模态模型冻结，并仅学习它们之间的一个小型交叉注意力桥，实现了视频引导的 Foley。该方法在保持提示驱动可控性和生产友好模块化的同时，在视频音频基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

TL;DR: Chunk-GRPO是一种基于块级别的GRPO优化方法，通过分组连续步骤并优化策略，解决了GRPO的局限性，实验证明其在T2I生成中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在流匹配基础的T2I生成中表现出潜力，但仍面临优势归因不准确和忽视生成时间动态性的限制。

Method: 提出Chunk-GRPO方法，将连续步骤分组为捕捉流匹配内在时间动态性的'块'，并在块级别优化策略，同时引入可选的加权采样策略以进一步提升性能。

Result: 实验表明Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Chunk-GRPO通过将优化范式从步骤级别转移到块级别，有效解决了GRPO在优势归因不准确和忽视生成时间动态性的问题，并在偏好对齐和图像质量方面取得了优越结果。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现优异，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡问题。

Method: TIGER采用“文本优先，图像后处理”的两阶段框架，首先恢复精确的文本结构，再以此指导后续的全图像超分辨率处理。

Result: TIGER在UltraZoom-ST数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了文本可读性并保持了整体图像质量。

Conclusion: TIGER通过两阶段框架成功解决了生成超分辨率方法在自然图像和文本处理之间的权衡问题，实现了文本可读性和图像质量的双重提升。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法未能有效捕捉学生模型认知能力的变化，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种基于Gompertz增长模型的阶段感知蒸馏策略，动态调整蒸馏损失权重，并结合Wasserstein距离和梯度匹配来衡量和优化教师与学生模型之间的特征差异和反向传播行为。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，Gompertz-CNN显著优于传统蒸馏方法，准确率分别提升8%和4%。

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN通过动态调整蒸馏损失权重和综合多种损失目标，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果，在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上分别实现了高达8%和4%的准确率提升。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Motivation: 耐药性癫痫的术前评估需要准确识别癫痫尖波，但手动检测因数据高维性和标注不一致性而困难重重，现有自动化方法在临床实践中效果不佳。

Method: 提出了两种模型架构：基于特征的人工神经网络（ANN）和卷积神经网络（CNN），并在59名患者的数据集上进行训练，同时采用交互式机器学习策略优化数据标注质量。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者中均优于现有最优模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），且交互式机器学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，即使是简单的深度学习架构也能有效处理复杂且标注不完美的数据，为临床实践中的自动化癫痫尖波检测提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

Conclusion: 该方法通过大规模合成数据生成和模糊感知架构显著提高了显著目标检测的泛化能力，仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现了20-50%的错误率降低，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过结合目标检测与事后可解释性方法，可以超越“黑盒”预测，开发出可审计、支持决策的保护监测工具。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限或数据质量低下的环境下，现有跨模态对齐模型（如 CLIP）常因过度自信和性能下降而受限。

Method: Modest-Align 采用两种互补策略：随机扰动（引入受控噪声模拟不确定性）和嵌入平滑（校准嵌入空间中的相似性分布）。

Result: Modest-Align 在多个基准数据集上的检索任务中表现优于现有方法，仅需 CLIP 1/100 的训练数据和 1/600 的 GPU 时间即可达到竞争性结果。

Conclusion: Modest-Align 提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，适用于现实世界中资源受限的跨模态对齐场景。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管现代视频扩散模型在大量训练数据下取得了进展，但仍存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，这些问题破坏了真实3D场景的幻觉。3D一致的视频生成对生成和重建任务的下游应用有重要影响。

Method: 我们使用基于偏好的优化方法，通过成对极几何约束来对齐扩散模型，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影问题。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习度量提供更稳定的优化信号，后者会产生噪声目标，影响对齐质量。在静态场景和动态相机上训练确保了高质量的测量，同时模型能有效泛化到多样化的动态内容。

Conclusion: 通过结合数据驱动的深度学习和经典几何计算机视觉，我们提出了一种实用方法，能够在保持视觉质量的同时生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Result: DAP-MAE在四个点云分析任务中表现优异，如在ScanObjectNN上的物体分类达到95.18%，在Bosphorus上的面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE通过自适应整合跨领域数据集的知识，在多种点云分析任务中表现出色，展示了其通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，显著优于基线（95.51%）和之前的最佳表现（96.8%）。在领域转移测试集上，模型表现也优于基线（52.55% vs. 51.20%）。

Conclusion: 论文总结了长尾识别方法在NACTI数据集上的系统性研究，展示了优化后的模型在测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，并强调了在领域转移情况下模型的泛化能力。同时，指出了LTR方法在极端领域转移下对'Tail'类别的局限性。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于邻近突触相似性的无监督分类方法，适用于果蝇数据，且无需预先知道突触类型的数量。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全切片图像（WSIs）的快速生成需要自动化方法以实现高效处理和准确分类。

Method: 研究评估了UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型作为特征提取器的性能，使用均值聚合策略将补丁级嵌入聚合成幻灯片级特征，并训练了多种机器学习分类器。

Result: 结果表明，Virchow2提取的补丁级特征在大多数幻灯片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归达到最高准确率（90%），但差异无统计学意义。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了基础模型在自动WSI分类中的潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为未来在幻灯片级表示学习中的进步铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成多视频时难以保持角色和背景的一致性，通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且仅解决角色一致性。BachVid旨在提供一种无需训练或参考图像的解决方案。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，BachVid首先生成一个身份视频并缓存中间变量，随后将这些变量注入新生成视频的对应位置，确保多个视频的前景和背景一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种无需训练或参考图像即可实现视频生成一致性的创新方法，通过利用DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，有效解决了现有方法在角色和背景一致性上的不足。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型是否能够直接解决几何问题，特别是那些长期存在的难题，如内接正方形问题、斯坦纳树问题和简单多边形问题。

Method: 将每个几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准的视觉扩散模型，将高斯噪声转化为表示近似解的图像。

Result: 模型成功将噪声几何结构转化为正确配置，展示了生成建模与几何问题解决之间的意外桥梁。

Conclusion: 视觉扩散模型能够作为有效的几何求解器，通过像素空间直接解决几何问题，这为处理更广泛的几何任务提供了通用且实用的框架。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个自动化框架，通过自反思代理检测视觉模型对特定视觉属性的依赖，显著提高了性能，并成功应用于最先进模型如CLIP和YOLOv8。

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

Motivation: 随着物联网设备数量激增和传感器数据爆炸性增长，冗余数据和能量消耗问题日益突出，亟需一种在线节能解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习（MARL）技术，在传感器层面动态调整覆盖范围，控制器层面进行数据分区和去冗余，全局层面平衡设备运行时间。

Result: 实验结果显示，Senses节省了控制设备11.37%的能耗，并将物联网设备网络的整体运行时间延长了20%。

Conclusion: Senses通过动态调整传感器覆盖范围和数据分区，显著减少了边缘物联网网络的能量消耗，并延长了整体运行时间。

Abstract: As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices continuously grows and
application scenarios constantly enrich, the volume of sensor data experiences
an explosive increase. However, substantial data demands considerable energy
during computation and transmission. Redundant deployment or mobile assistance
is essential to cover the target area reliably with fault-prone sensors.
Consequently, the ``butterfly effect" may appear during the IoT operation,
since unreasonable data overlap could result in many duplicate data. To this
end, we propose Senses, a novel online energy saving solution for edge IoT
networks, with the insight of sensing and storing less at the network edge by
adopting Muti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Senses achieves data
de-duplication by dynamically adjusting sensor coverage at the sensor level.
For exceptional cases where sensor coverage cannot be altered, Senses conducts
data partitioning and eliminates redundant data at the controller level.
Furthermore, at the global level, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices,
Senses balances the operational duration among the devices to prolong the
overall operational duration of edge IoT networks. We evaluate the performance
of Senses through testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that
Senses saves 11.37% of energy consumption on control devices and prolongs 20%
overall operational duration of the IoT device network.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in sensor networks, conventional battery-powered
sensor networks suffer from limited operational lifespans and frequent
maintenance requirements that severely constrain their deployment in remote and
inaccessible environments. As such, wireless rechargeable sensor networks
(WRSNs) with mobile charging capabilities offer a promising solution to extend
network lifetime. However, WRSNs face critical challenges from the inherent
trade-off between maximizing the node survival rates and maximizing charging
energy efficiency under dynamic operational conditions. In this paper, we
investigate a typical scenario where mobile chargers move and charge the
sensor, thereby maintaining the network connectivity while minimizing the
energy waste. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem
that simultaneously maximizes the network node survival rate and mobile charger
energy usage efficiency across multiple time slots, which presents NP-hard
computational complexity with long-term temporal dependencies that make
traditional optimization approaches ineffective. To address these challenges,
we propose an enhanced evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning
algorithm, which integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based policy
network for temporal pattern recognition, a multilayer perceptron-based
prospective increment model for future state prediction, and a time-varying
Pareto policy evaluation method for dynamic preference adaptation. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms existing approaches in balancing node survival rate and energy
efficiency while generating diverse Pareto-optimal solutions. Moreover, the
LSTM-enhanced policy network converges 25% faster than conventional networks,
with the time-varying evaluation method effectively adapting to dynamic
conditions.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis systems in school environments
increasingly relies on IoT-enabled cameras, yet pure cloud processing raises
privacy and latency concerns while pure edge inference suffers from limited
accuracy. We propose Confidence-Constrained Cloud-Edge Knowledge Distillation
(C3EKD), a hierarchical framework that performs most inference at the edge and
selectively uploads only low-confidence samples to the cloud. The cloud
produces temperature-scaled soft labels and distils them back to edge models
via a global loss aggregated across participating schools, improving
generalization without centralizing raw data. On two public ASD facial-image
datasets, the proposed framework achieves a superior accuracy of 87.4\%,
demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: TURBOTEST是一种基于ML的自适应网速测试终止框架，通过两阶段预测和分类，显著减少数据消耗并保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网速测试（如Ookla、M-Lab等）因静态洪水式设计导致大量数据消耗（每月PB级流量），亟需一种在不牺牲精度的情况下提前终止测试的方法。

Method: TURBOTEST分为两个阶段：第一阶段训练回归器预测最终吞吐量，第二阶段训练分类器决定何时终止测试。利用传输层特征（RTT、重传、拥塞窗口）和吞吐量，通过单一可调参数控制精度容忍度，并包含高变异性情况的回退机制。

Result: 在17.3万次M-Lab NDT测试中，TURBOTEST比基于BBR信号的方法节省2-4倍数据，同时降低中位误差。

Conclusion: TURBOTEST通过自适应ML终止机制，实现了高精度、高效率且可扩展的网速测试，显著减少了数据使用量和误差。

Abstract: Internet speed tests are indispensable for users, ISPs, and policymakers, but
their static flooding-based design imposes growing costs: a single high-speed
test can transfer hundreds of megabytes, and collectively, platforms like
Ookla, M-Lab, and Fast.com generate petabytes of traffic each month. Reducing
this burden requires deciding when a test can be stopped early without
sacrificing accuracy. We frame this as an optimal stopping problem and show
that existing heuristics-static thresholds, BBR pipe-full signals, or
throughput stability rules from Fast.com and FastBTS-capture only a narrow
portion of the achievable accuracy-savings trade-off. This paper introduces
TURBOTEST, a systematic framework for speed test termination that sits atop
existing platforms. The key idea is to decouple throughput prediction (Stage 1)
from test termination (Stage 2): Stage 1 trains a regressor to estimate final
throughput from partial measurements, while Stage 2 trains a classifier to
decide when sufficient evidence has accumulated to stop. Leveraging richer
transport-level features (RTT, retransmissions, congestion window) alongside
throughput, TURBOTEST exposes a single tunable parameter for accuracy tolerance
and includes a fallback mechanism for high-variability cases. Evaluation on
173,000 M-Lab NDT speed tests (2024-2025) shows that TURBOTEST achieves nearly
2-4x higher data savings than an approach based on BBR signals while reducing
median error. These results demonstrate that adaptive ML-based termination can
deliver accurate, efficient, and deployable speed tests at scale.

Method: 通过定义一组QoC KPIs，并利用三个不同的数据集来分析这些指标对网络行为的表征能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Quality of Coverage (QoC)这一多维度的关键性能指标集，能够更全面地反映蜂窝网络覆盖的实际性能、可用性和稳定性，相比现有指标提供了更精细和有用的表征。

Abstract: Current representations of cellular coverage are overly simplistic; they
state only the minimal level of available bandwidth (i.e., 35/3Mbps
download/upload speed for 5G) and fail to incorporate a critical component of
usability: network stability over space and time. Cellular coverage quality is
complex given wireless propagation characteristics and relationships between
network load and (often limited) network capacity. A more fine-grained
characterization is essential. We introduce Quality of Coverage (QoC), a novel
multi-dimensional set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect actual
measured performance quality, usability and stability. This representation of
the coverage of the cellular network more fully captures temporal and spatial
usability and resilience. We motivate and define a set of QoC KPIs and use
three distinct datasets to analyze the ability of the KPIs to characterize
network behavior, demonstrating the ability of QoC to offer a more fine-grained
and useful representation of cellular coverage than possible with current
metrics.

TL;DR: A source-coded multicast framework using flow decomposition and path redirection offers near-network-coding throughput with lower complexity, outperforming traditional multicast trees in efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of traditional multicast trees (path redundancy, poor resource utilization) and the high computational overhead of network coding, the authors propose a novel multicast framework.

Method: The paper introduces a source-coded multicast framework using maximum-flow decomposition to construct multiple disjoint or partially overlapping paths. It includes a path redirection mechanism for loop-free delivery and throughput maximization, along with algorithms for path construction, overlap detection, and iterative refinement of multicast subgraphs.

Result: The proposed method achieves throughput close to network coding with lower complexity and outperforms multicast trees in fairness, robustness to link failures, and delivery efficiency.

Conclusion: Source-coded multicast is presented as a practical and scalable solution for next-generation networks, offering high-throughput and adaptive group communication with lower complexity compared to network coding and better performance than traditional multicast trees.

Abstract: Multicast remains a fundamental mechanism for scalable content distribution,
yet existing approaches face critical limitations. Traditional multicast trees
suffer from path redundancy and inefficient utilization of network resources,
while network coding, although capacity-achieving, incurs significant
computational overhead and deployment challenges. In this paper, we introduce a
source-coded multicast framework that exploits maximum-flow decomposition to
construct multiple disjoint or partially overlapping paths from the source to
all receivers. Our scheme incorporates a novel path redirection mechanism: when
multiple overlaps occur between receiver flows, downstream paths are realigned
at the first intersection, ensuring loop-free delivery while maximizing overall
throughput. We develop algorithms for path construction, overlap detection, and
iterative refinement of multicast subgraphs, and analyze their computational
complexity. Through extensive evaluation on synthetic and real network
topologies, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently approaches the
throughput of network coding with substantially lower encoding and decoding
complexity, while significantly outperforming multicast tree constructions in
terms of fairness, robustness to link failures, and delivery efficiency. These
results position source-coded multicast as a practical and scalable solution
for next-generation networks requiring high-throughput and adaptive group
communication.

Abstract: While data-driven methods offer significant promise for modeling complex
materials, they often face challenges in generalizing across diverse physical
scenarios and maintaining physical consistency. To address these limitations,
we propose a generalizable framework called Physics-Embedded Conditional Neural
Constitutive Laws for Elastoplastic Materials, which combines the partial
differential equations with neural networks. Specifically, the model employs
two separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws.
Simultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional
inputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios
with varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across
different properties without requiring retraining for each individual case.
Furthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its
explicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical
parameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our
framework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties. Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in motion reconstruction,
robust long-term prediction, geometry generalization, and precise parameters
estimation for elastoplastic materials, highlighting its versatility as a
unified simulator and inverse analysis tool.

Result: 对于$p \in [2,\infty)$，证明了$\Omega(p(\log n / \log^2\log n)^{1-1/p})$的硬度结果；对于$p = \infty$，改进了硬度结果为$\tilde\Omega(\log^2 n)$。

Conclusion: 该论文得出了$\ell_p$-最短路径问题的近似硬度结果，填补了$p < \infty$时无硬度结果的空白，并改进了$p = \infty$时的硬度结果。

Abstract: We obtain hardness of approximation results for the $\ell_p$-Shortest Path
problem, a variant of the classic Shortest Path problem with vector costs. For
every integer $p \in [2,\infty)$, we show a hardness of $\Omega(p(\log n /
\log^2\log n)^{1-1/p})$ for both polynomial- and quasi-polynomial-time
approximation algorithms. This nearly matches the approximation factor of
$O(p(\log n / \log\log n)^{1-1/p})$ achieved by a quasi-polynomial-time
algorithm of Makarychev, Ovsiankin, and Tani (ICALP 2025). No hardness of
approximation results were previously known for any $p < \infty$. We also
present results for the case where $p$ is a function of $n$. For $p = \infty$,
we establish a hardness of $\tilde\Omega(\log^2 n)$, improving upon the
previous $\tilde\Omega(\log n)$ hardness result. Our result nearly matches the
$O(\log^2 n)$ approximation guarantee of the quasi-polynomial-time algorithm by
Li, Xu, and Zhang (ICALP 2025). Finally, we present asymptotic bounds on
higher-order Bell numbers, which might be of independent interest.

TL;DR: 提出元算法将鲁棒子模最大化算法转化为噪声环境版本，结合连续贪婪和双贪婪算法，实现了不同约束下的高近似比。

Motivation: 解决在噪声环境下子模最大化问题，提升算法在噪声环境中的性能。

Method: 设计了一种元算法，将鲁棒的精确子模最大化算法作为黑箱，转化为适用于噪声环境的算法。

Result: 通过元算法与连续贪婪算法结合，实现了（1-1/e）近似（单调）和1/e近似（非单调）子模最大化；与双贪婪算法结合，实现了1/2近似无约束子模最大化。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种元算法，能够将任何‘鲁棒’的精确子模最大化算法转化为适用于噪声环境的算法，同时保持近似保证。通过该元算法与连续贪婪算法结合，实现了在噪声环境下对单调（非单调）子模最大化问题的（1-1/e）近似（1/e近似）。此外，与双贪婪算法结合，实现了对无约束（非单调）子模最大化问题的1/2近似。

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a
noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar
to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple
calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this
model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm
for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and
Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone
submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this
paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm
for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an
algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By
using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we
obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone
(resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint
under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy
algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone)
submodular maximization under noise.

TL;DR: 论文证明Morell和Skutella的猜想可推导Goemans猜想，并推广了Linhares和Swamy的技术，应用于加权环加载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对单源不可分割流问题进行了广泛研究，但进展有限。Morell和Skutella提出了一个替代猜想，论文旨在探索这一猜想与Goemans猜想的关系及其应用。

Method: 通过推广Linhares和Swamy的技术，提供了一个简单的初等证明，并展示了该技术在加权环加载问题中的应用。

Result: 证明了Morell和Skutella的猜想暗示Goemans的猜想（违反程度为最大需求的两倍），并在加权环加载问题中展示了技术的应用。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了Morell和Skutella的猜想可以推导出Goemans的猜想（违反程度为最大需求的两倍），并展示了如何将无成本保证的算法转化为具有额外成本保证的近似算法。

Abstract: A famous conjecture of Goemans on single-source unsplittable flows states
that one can turn any fractional flow into an unsplittable one of no higher
cost, while increasing the load on any arc by at most the maximum demand.
Despite extensive work on the topic, only limited progress has been made.
Recently, Morell and Skutella suggested an alternative conjecture, stating that
one can turn any fractional flow into an unsplittable one without changing the
load on any arc by more than the maximum demand.
  We show that their conjecture implies Goemans' conjecture (with a violation
of twice the maximum demand). To this end, we generalize a technique of
Linhares and Swamy, used to obtain a low-cost chain-constrained spanning tree
from an algorithm without cost guarantees. Whereas Linhares and Swamy's proof
relies on Langrangian duality, we provide a very simple elementary proof of a
generalized version, which we hope to be of independent interest. Moreover, we
show how this technique can also be used in the context of the weighted ring
loading problem, showing that cost-unaware approximation algorithms can be
transformed into approximation algorithms with additional cost guarantees.

Abstract: Understanding the role of randomness when solving locally checkable labeling
(LCL) problems in the LOCAL model has been one of the top priorities in the
research on distributed graph algorithms in recent years. For LCL problems in
bounded-degree graphs, it is known that randomness cannot help more than
polynomially, except in one case: if the deterministic complexity of an LCL
problem is in $\Omega(\log n)$ and its randomized complexity is in $o(\log n)$,
then the randomized complexity is guaranteed to be $poly(\log \log n)$.
However, the fundamental question of \emph{which} problems with a deterministic
complexity of $\Omega(\log n)$ can be solved exponentially faster using
randomization still remains wide open.
  We make a step towards answering this question by studying a simple, but
natural class of LCL problems: so-called degree splitting problems. These
problems come in two varieties: coloring problems where the edges of a graph
have to be colored with $2$ colors and orientation problems where each edge
needs to be oriented. For $\Delta$-regular graphs (where $\Delta=O(1)$), we
obtain the following results.
  - We gave an exact characterization of the randomized complexity of all
problems where the edges need to be colored with two colors, say red and blue,
and which have a deterministic complexity of $O(\log n)$. - For edge
orientation problems, we give a partial characterization of the problems that
have a randomized complexity of $\Omega(\log n)$ and the problems that have a
randomized complexity of $poly\log\log n$.
  While our results are cleanest to state for the $\Delta$-regular case, all
our algorithms naturally generalize to nodes of any degree $d<\Delta$ in
general graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$.

Motivation: 模糊或加权社交网络等可以建模为模糊解释，最小化这些解释能提供更紧凑的表示，从而显著提升知识系统中推理和分析任务的效率。

Method: 提出了一种扩展算法，支持近似保留模糊概念断言，时间复杂度为O((m log l + n) log n)，其中n为解释域的大小，m为非零原子角色实例数，l为使用的不同模糊值数量加2。

Result: 算法在Gödel语义下有效最小化有限模糊解释，支持近似保留模糊概念断言，适用于从fALC子逻辑到扩展fALC_reg的FDL类。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了首个在Gödel语义下，无需Baaz投影算子和通用角色的模糊描述逻辑中最小化有限模糊解释的算法，支持近似保留，显著提升了知识系统中推理和分析任务的效率。

Abstract: The problem of minimizing fuzzy interpretations in fuzzy description logics
(FDLs) is important both theoretically and practically. For instance, fuzzy or
weighted social networks can be modeled as fuzzy interpretations, where
individuals represent actors and roles capture interactions. Minimizing such
interpretations yields more compact representations, which can significantly
improve the efficiency of reasoning and analysis tasks in knowledge-based
systems. We present the first algorithm that minimizes a finite fuzzy
interpretation while preserving fuzzy concept assertions in FDLs without the
Baaz projection operator and the universal role, under the G\"odel semantics.
The considered class of FDLs ranges from the sublogic of $f\!\mathcal{ALC}$
without the union operator and universal restriction to the FDL that extends
$f\!\mathcal{ALC}_{reg}$ with inverse roles and nominals. Our algorithm is
given in an extended form that supports approximate preservation: it minimizes
a finite fuzzy interpretation $\mathcal{I}$ while preserving fuzzy concept
assertions up to a degree $\gamma \in (0,1]$. Its time complexity is
$O((m\log{l} + n)\log{n})$, where $n$ is the size of the domain of
$\mathcal{I}$, $m$ is the number of nonzero instances of atomic roles in
$\mathcal{I}$, and $l$ is the number of distinct fuzzy values used in such
instances plus 2.

Abstract: We study a network design problem motivated by the challenge of placing
wildlife crossings to reconnect fragmented habitats of animal species, which is
among the 17 goals towards sustainable development by the UN: Given a graph,
whose vertices represent the fragmented habitat areas and whose edges represent
possible green bridge locations (with costs), and the habitable vertex set for
each species' habitat, the goal is to find the cheapest set of edges such that
each species' habitat is sufficiently connected. We focus on the established
variant where a habitat is considered sufficiently connected if it has diameter
two in the solution and study its complexity in cases justified by our setting
namely small habitat sizes on planar graphs and graphs of small maximum degree
$\Delta$. We provide efficient algorithms and NP-hardness results for different
values of $\Delta$ and maximum habitat sizes on general and planar graphs.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为“按书分析”的新算法分析框架，旨在缩小理论与实践的差距。通过该框架，作者证明了在输入缩放假设、可行性容忍度等设计原则下，单纯形法确实实现了多项式时间运行。

Abstract: Narrowing the gap between theory and practice is a longstanding goal of the
algorithm analysis community. To further progress our understanding of how
algorithms work in practice, we propose a new algorithm analysis framework that
we call by the book analysis. In contrast to earlier frameworks, by the book
analysis not only models an algorithm's input data, but also the algorithm
itself. Results from by the book analysis are meant to correspond well with
established knowledge of an algorithm's practical behavior, as they are meant
to be grounded in observations from implementations, input modeling best
practices, and measurements on practical benchmark instances. We apply our
framework to the simplex method, an algorithm which is beloved for its
excellent performance in practice and notorious for its high running time under
worst-case analysis. The simplex method similarly showcased the state of the
art framework smoothed analysis (Spielman and Teng, STOC'01). We explain how
our framework overcomes several weaknesses of smoothed analysis and we prove
that under input scaling assumptions, feasibility tolerances and other design
principles used by simplex method implementations, the simplex method indeed
attains a polynomial running time.

Conclusion: AgentArcEval是一种专门设计用于评估基于FM的智能体架构复杂性的新方法，结合特定场景目录，为实际应用中的架构设计和评估提供了有效指导。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models (FMs) has enabled the development of
highly capable and autonomous agents, unlocking new application opportunities
across a wide range of domains. Evaluating the architecture of agents is
particularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the
quality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including
compound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and
continuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in
addressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique
characteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present
AgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially
to address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation.
Moreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which
serves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the
agent architecture. We demonstrate the usefulness of AgentArcEval and the
catalogue through a case study on the architecture evaluation of a real-world
tax copilot, named Luna.

Motivation: 现有工具在识别跨多行文本块的编辑动作时存在局限，通常将其表示为离散的行级编辑动作序列，这降低了变更理解的效率。

Method: 基于传统的差异分析算法，首先构建包含所有可能的行映射和块映射的候选集，然后利用Kuhn-Munkres算法计算最优映射集，以最小化编辑脚本的大小并贴近开发者的原始意图。

Conclusion: BDiff算法在代码差异分析中表现出更高的质量，同时保持了竞争力的运行时性能，验证了其在块级和行级编辑动作识别上的有效性。

Abstract: Code differencing is a fundamental technique in software engineering practice
and research. While researchers have proposed text-based differencing
techniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing
methods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that
operate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in
developers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or
duplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent
such block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling
developers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the
efficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a
text-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of
block-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional
differencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all
possible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres
algorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size
of the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's
intent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five
state-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines
and adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their
performance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental
results show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than
baseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our
experiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks
regarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime
efficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool.

Conclusion: R2ComSync通过结合检索和重排策略，显著提升了代码注释同步的性能，并在实验中证明了其优于现有方法的效果。

Abstract: Code-Comment Synchronization (CCS) aims to synchronize the comments with code
changes in an automated fashion, thereby significantly reducing the workload of
developers during software maintenance and evolution. While previous studies
have proposed various solutions that have shown success, they often exhibit
limitations, such as a lack of generalization ability or the need for extensive
task-specific learning resources. This motivates us to investigate the
potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area. However, a pilot
analysis proves that LLMs fall short of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CCS approaches
because (1) they lack instructive demonstrations for In-Context Learning (ICL)
and (2) many correct-prone candidates are not prioritized.To tackle the above
challenges, we propose R2ComSync, an ICL-based code-Comment Synchronization
approach enhanced with Retrieval and Re-ranking. Specifically, R2ComSync
carries corresponding two novelties: (1) Ensemble hybrid retrieval. It equally
considers the similarity in both code-comment semantics and change patterns
when retrieval, thereby creating ICL prompts with effective examples. (2)
Multi-turn re-ranking strategy. We derived three significant rules through
large-scale CCS sample analysis. Given the inference results of LLMs, it
progressively exploits three re-ranking rules to prioritize relatively
correct-prone candidates. We evaluate R2ComSync using five recent LLMs on three
CCS datasets covering both Java and Python programming languages, and make
comparisons with five SOTA approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of R2ComSync against other approaches. Moreover, both
quantitative and qualitative analyses provide compelling evidence that the
comments synchronized by our proposal exhibit significantly higher quality.}

Abstract: GenAI-based coding assistants have disrupted software development. Their next
generation is agent-based, operating with more autonomy and potentially without
human oversight. One challenge is to provide AI agents with sufficient context
about the software projects they operate in. Like humans, AI agents require
contextual information to develop solutions that are in line with the target
architecture, interface specifications, coding guidelines, standard workflows,
and other project-specific policies. Popular AI agents for software development
(e.g., Claude Code) advocate for maintaining tool-specific version-controlled
Markdown files that cover aspects such as the project structure, building and
testing, or code style. The content of these files is automatically added to
each prompt. AGENTS.md has emerged as a potential standard that consolidates
tool-specific formats. However, little is known about whether and how
developers adopt this format. Therefore, in this paper, we present the results
of a preliminary study investigating the adoption of AI configuration files in
466 open-source software projects, what information developers provide in these
files, how they present that information, and how they evolve over time. Our
findings indicate that there is no established structure yet, and that there is
a lot of variation in terms of how context is provided (descriptive,
prescriptive, prohibitive, explanatory, conditional). We see great potential in
studying which modifications in structure or presentation can positively affect
the quality of the generated content. Finally, our analysis of commits that
have modified AGENTS.md files provides first insights into how projects
continuously extend and maintain these files. We conclude the paper by
outlining how the adoption of AI configuration files in provides a unique
opportunity to study real-world prompt and context engineering.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其高计算成本、数据共享风险和对外部服务的依赖限制了其应用，因此需要探索轻量级的替代方案。

Method: 研究比较了八种模型（包括三种LLMs和五种SLMs）在PROMISE、PROMISE Reclass和SecReq数据集上的需求分类任务表现。

Result: LLMs的平均F1分数比SLMs高2%，但差异无统计学意义；SLMs在PROMISE Reclass数据集上的召回率甚至超过LLMs，且模型大小差异达300倍。数据集特性对性能的影响比模型大小更显著。

Conclusion: 研究表明，小型语言模型（SLMs）在需求分类任务中可以作为大型语言模型（LLMs）的有效替代方案，尤其在隐私、成本和本地部署方面具有优势。

Abstract: [Context and motivation] Large language models (LLMs) show notable results in
natural language processing (NLP) tasks for requirements engineering (RE).
However, their use is compromised by high computational cost, data sharing
risks, and dependence on external services. In contrast, small language models
(SLMs) offer a lightweight, locally deployable alternative. [Question/problem]
It remains unclear how well SLMs perform compared to LLMs in RE tasks in terms
of accuracy. [Results] Our preliminary study compares eight models, including
three LLMs and five SLMs, on requirements classification tasks using the
PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq datasets. Our results show that although
LLMs achieve an average F1 score of 2% higher than SLMs, this difference is not
statistically significant. SLMs almost reach LLMs performance across all
datasets and even outperform them in recall on the PROMISE Reclass dataset,
despite being up to 300 times smaller. We also found that dataset
characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size.
[Contribution] Our study contributes with evidence that SLMs are a valid
alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, offering advantages in
privacy, cost, and local deployability.

computational resources, and strict power constraints. To address these
challenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to
optimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique
quality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as
crashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation.
Unfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these
quality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as
these models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor
processing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature
extraction. These capabilities necessitate specialized model components, which
existing testing methods neglect during model generation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Scalpel, an automotive DL frameworks testing method that generates
test input models at the model component level. Scalpel generates models by
assembling model components (heads, necks, backbones) to support capabilities
required by autonomous driving systems. Specifically, Scalpel maintains and
updates a repository of model components, generating test inputs by selecting,
mutating, and assembling them. Successfully generated models are added back to
enrich the repository. Newly generated models are then deployed within the
autonomous driving system to test automotive DL frameworks via differential
testing.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出通过社会技术模型增强软件供应链的威胁检测能力，结合技术和社交数据监控，以应对复杂和动态的供应链攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件供应链的复杂性和动态性使得传统的技术监控方法难以全面应对日益增长的攻击，需要结合社会技术动态进行更有效的威胁检测。

Method: 通过分析XZ Utils攻击案例，展示了社会技术动态在威胁检测中的重要性，并提出了结合技术和社交数据监控的方法。

Result: 研究表明，监控技术和社交数据可以识别可疑行为趋势，从而指导有针对性的漏洞评估。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个研究愿景，即通过开发和应用社会技术模型来支持软件供应链的自适应威胁检测，以弥补当前研究的不足。

Abstract: Software supply chains (SSCs) are complex systems composed of dynamic,
heterogeneous technical and social components which collectively achieve the
production and maintenance of software artefacts. Attacks on SSCs are
increasing, yet pervasive vulnerability analysis is challenging due to their
complexity. Therefore, threat detection must be targeted, to account for the
large and dynamic structure, and adaptive, to account for its change and
diversity. While current work focuses on technical approaches for monitoring
supply chain dependencies and establishing component controls, approaches which
inform threat detection through understanding the socio-technical dynamics are
lacking. We outline a position and research vision to develop and investigate
the use of socio-technical models to support adaptive threat detection of SSCs.
We motivate this approach through an analysis of the XZ Utils attack whereby
malicious actors undermined the maintainers' trust via the project's GitHub and
mailing lists. We highlight that monitoring technical and social data can
identify trends which indicate suspicious behaviour to then inform targeted and
intensive vulnerability assessment. We identify challenges and research
directions to achieve this vision considering techniques for developer and
software analysis, decentralised adaptation and the need for a test bed for
software supply chain security research.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析26个流行LLM基准测试，识别潜在故障模式并提出缓解策略，开发了BenchRisk评分系统，帮助评估基准测试风险并促进风险管理的开放共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）基准测试用于指导LLM的使用决策，但基准测试可能因各种故障模式而变得不可靠，影响基准测试的偏差、方差、覆盖范围或人们对基准测试证据的理解能力。

Method: 基于美国国家标准与技术研究院的风险管理流程，研究迭代分析了26个流行基准测试，识别了57种潜在的故障模式及196种相应的缓解策略。

Result: 研究开发了BenchRisk评分系统，用于评估基准测试的风险，高评分表明基准测试用户更不容易对LLM得出错误或不支持的结论。

Conclusion: 论文提出了BenchRisk工作流程，作为一个开源工具，它不仅便于比较不同基准测试，还能帮助识别和分享风险及其缓解策略。所有26个评估基准在五个评分维度中的至少一个维度上表现出显著风险，这为LLM基准测试领域指明了重要的开放研究方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) benchmarks inform LLM use decisions (e.g., "is
this LLM safe to deploy for my use case and context?"). However, benchmarks may
be rendered unreliable by various failure modes that impact benchmark bias,
variance, coverage, or people's capacity to understand benchmark evidence.
Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's risk management
process as a foundation, this research iteratively analyzed 26 popular
benchmarks, identifying 57 potential failure modes and 196 corresponding
mitigation strategies. The mitigations reduce failure likelihood and/or
severity, providing a frame for evaluating "benchmark risk," which is scored to
provide a metaevaluation benchmark: BenchRisk. Higher scores indicate that
benchmark users are less likely to reach an incorrect or unsupported conclusion
about an LLM. All 26 scored benchmarks present significant risk within one or
more of the five scored dimensions (comprehensiveness, intelligibility,
consistency, correctness, and longevity), which points to important open
research directions for the field of LLM benchmarking. The BenchRisk workflow
allows for comparison between benchmarks; as an open-source tool, it also
facilitates the identification and sharing of risks and their mitigations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究证明，基于多样性的LLM集成策略能有效提升性能，避免共识策略的“流行陷阱”，为软件工程任务提供高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前追求单一大型语言模型（LMM）进行所有软件工程任务既资源密集又忽视了互补性的潜在好处，即不同模型贡献独特优势的可能性。然而，编码LLM之间的互补程度以及最大化集成潜力的最佳策略尚不明确，使得从业者缺乏超越单模型系统的清晰路径。

Method: 研究通过实证比较了来自五个家族的十个个体LLM以及三个集成模型在三个软件工程基准（代码生成和程序修复）上的表现，评估了模型之间的互补性和集成模型与最佳个体模型之间的性能差距。

Result: 研究发现，集成模型的理论性能上限可以比最佳单模型高出83%。基于共识的策略容易陷入“流行陷阱”，放大常见但不正确的输出；而基于多样性的策略能够实现高达95%的理论潜力，且在小型两模型集成中依然有效。

Conclusion: 研究发现，基于多样性的策略能够实现高达95%的理论潜力，即使在小型两模型集成中也能有效提升性能，为利用多个LLM提供了成本效益高的方法。

Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software
engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of
complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However,
the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for
maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a
clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five
families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering
benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the
complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best
individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection
heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be
83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based
strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying
common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes
up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small
two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by
leveraging multiple LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在非办公时间实现无人值守的卫星操作，并为用户提供灵活的24/7访问权限，设计了这一自动化地面段概念。

Method: 通过预计划和自动执行的调度、自动监控系统以及自服务用户门户，实现了卫星平台操作的全面自动化。

Result: 该概念成功应用于Heinrich Hertz任务，支持用户实验的实时监控和快速重新配置，提高了操作效率和灵活性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种用于德国卫星通信任务Heinrich Hertz的自动化地面段概念，实现了无人值守的卫星操作和用户实验的灵活管理。

Abstract: We present our approach for a periodically unstaffed, fully automated ground
segment. The concept is in use for the first time on the German satellite
communications mission Heinrich Hertz on behalf of the German Space Agency at
DLR. Heinrich Hertz was launched in July 2023 and offers access to scientific
and technical experiments to its users. The mission utilizes major automation
concepts for the satellite platform operations, allowing fully automated
operations outside of office hours. The concept includes tracking, telemetry
and commanding (TTC) of the satellite. Pre-planned and automatically executed
schedules enable commanding without human interaction. The user mission
schedule is planned separately from the main mission schedule and is
automatically de-conflicted. The automatic monitoring concept monitors the
systems of the satellite and all assets in the ground segment and triggers
reactions in operator-configurable ways depending on the mission needs, for
example emergency notifications or automated execution of flight operation
procedures. Additionally, the concept also puts special emphasis on a
self-service user portal that provides flexible access 24/7, even when the
control center is not staffed. The portal allows external users of the payload
to schedule pre-defined experiments, monitor the live execution of the
experiment with browser-based displays and access ground station telemetry and
dedicated RF test equipment during the time of their scheduled experiment.
Tasks can be planned long in advance as well as with a short reaction time
(less than 1 minute), which allows, for example, the reconfiguration of the
payload during a running experiment.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了GDPR合规中联合需求和系统规范的需求，提出了一种基于法律概念建模的方法，支持隐私设计（PbD）并满足规范目标如透明度和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对从业者在规范目标和目标上的视角的理解，现有方法未能解决GDPR中表达的问题与解决方案空间的复杂交叉。本研究探索了对PbD联合需求和系统规范的需求，并提出了一种方法来解决这一需求。

Method: 我们审查了相关次要和主要研究，并与从业者进行了访谈，以（1）调查实践现状，（2）理解基础规范目标和目标（如可追溯性）。我们开发并评估了一种用于PbD的需求和系统规范方法，并针对规范目标进行了评估。

Result: 问题与解决方案空间之间的关系，如GDPR中所表达的，对于支持PbD至关重要。我们展示了基于原始法律概念建模GDPR内容的方法如何有助于捕获法律知识、支持规范透明度和可追溯性等规范目标。

Conclusion: GDPR demands需要在整个工程生命周期的不同抽象层次上解决，以实现隐私设计（PbD）。应在规范中捕获GDPR文本中的法律知识，以满足不同利益相关者的需求并确保合规。虽然我们的结果证实了该方法满足实际需求的适用性，但也揭示了未来有效操作该方法的具体需求。

Abstract: Context: Consistent requirements and system specifications are essential for
the compliance of software systems towards the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and
conjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There
is little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification
objectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the
complex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In
this study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system
specification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:
We reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with
practitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the
underlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We
developed and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification
for PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The
relationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is
instrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the
modeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to
specification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification
transparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed
throughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to
achieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in
specifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure
compliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to
address practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future
effective operationalization of the approach.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种人机交互方法，利用MLLM和多智能体框架将手绘草图转换为3D BIM模型，实验显示高准确率和逐步优化的几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过MLLM驱动的多智能体框架，简化BIM模型的创建过程，使其对专家和非专家都更加易用。

Method: 研究采用了一种人机交互的管道，结合感知提取、人类反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将未缩放的手绘楼层平面图草图转换为语义一致的3D BIM模型。

Result: 在十个不同的楼层平面图上进行的实验显示，初始阶段门、窗等开口的捕捉可靠性高，而墙体检测初始准确率约为83%，经过几次反馈迭代后接近完美对齐。所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均保持在0.83以上，几何误差（RMSE、MAE）通过反馈修正逐渐降至零。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何通过MLLM驱动的多智能体推理，使BIM创建仅需手绘草图即可对专家和非专家都变得可行。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

TL;DR: CAS方法通过分离概念连贯性和文化典型性，生成既原创又连贯的艺术构思，表现优于GPT-4o和随机选择，接近人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在开放领域（如艺术）中生成的想法要么过于依赖文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时失去连贯性。

Method: 引入Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS)方法，通过两个GPT-2模型（概念一致性模型和文化背景模型）分别评估概念组合的连贯性和文化典型性，选择高连贯性低典型性的组合。

Result: 人类评估显示CAS在原创性和和谐性上优于基线，定量研究证明其输出更具多样性，探索了更广的概念空间。

Conclusion: 使用Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS)方法，自主代理能够在保持内部一致性的同时，生成偏离文化常规的原创想法，其表现优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，并与人类艺术学生相当。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的模糊数类型——可扩展模糊数，并定义了其操作和关系运算符，通过应用示例和C++实现展示了其有效性，解决了传统模糊数运算中的计算复杂性和模糊扩散问题。

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于开源LLM的框架，用于从异构EHR中提取统一MOUD处方数据，并在多诊所数据中验证了其高效性（Qwen2.5-32B达93.4%覆盖率）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录系统中药物数据的异构性是监控阿片类药物使用障碍（MOUD）治疗的主要障碍。关键处方属性分散在不同格式的字段和自由文本中，亟需一种统一且实用的解决方案。

Method: 该研究定制了包括Llama、Qwen、Gemma和MedGemma在内的开源大语言模型，以从异构数据中提取统一的MOUD处方属性，并设计了一个处理固定JSON格式记录的流程，包括轻量级归一化和跨字段一致性检查。

Result: 在来自五个诊所的25,605条记录（1,257名患者）的评估中，较大的模型表现最佳：Qwen2.5-32B实现了93.4%的覆盖率和93.0%的精确匹配准确率，MedGemma-27B则达到93.1%/92.2%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于开源大语言模型的框架，用于从异构电子健康记录系统中提取统一标准的MOUD处方数据，并通过标准化指标评估药物覆盖率。该方法在多个诊所的实际数据中表现优异，为跨站点分析MOUD暴露、依从性和留存提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

Motivation: 探讨何时应优先考虑AI输出而非人类专家判断，尤其是在AI系统具备认知权威性（AEA）的情况下。

Method: 通过分析经典反对意见（如不加批判的遵从、认知固化等）在AEAs中的放大效应，提出总证据视角作为替代方案。

Result: 总证据视角具有三个关键优势：防止专业知识萎缩、支持有意义的人类监督、解释对AI的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种总证据视角的AI遵从方法，主张AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代用户的独立认知考量，这在高风险情境中尤其重要。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

Motivation: 解决非专家用户在分析空间数据时面临的SQL和PostGIS等工具的专业性障碍，以及单智能体方法在处理空间查询语义和句法复杂性时的不足。

Method: 研究提出了一种多智能体框架，包括知识库、程序化模式分析、语义增强、上下文检索嵌入以及协作多智能体管道，核心由专门化的代理组成，如实体提取、元数据检索、查询逻辑制定、SQL生成和审查代理。

Result: 在非空间的KaggleDBQA基准测试中，系统整体准确率达到81.2%（221/272问题）；在空间查询的SpatialQueryQA基准测试中，准确率为87.7%（79/90问题），且在语义对齐性上优于基准。

Conclusion: 该研究通过多智能体框架有效解决了自然语言到空间SQL查询的翻译问题，提高了查询的准确性和语义对齐性，为非专家用户提供了更便捷的空间数据分析途径，并推动了自主GIS的发展。

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

Conclusion: MedAlign框架通过mDPO目标、RA-MoE架构和联邦治理机制，显著提升了LVLMs在Med-VQA中的性能，减少了幻觉并优化了推理效率。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新型深度强化学习算法，该算法能够有效应对观测数据中的混淆偏差，并在存在未观测混淆的情况下，显著优于标准的DQN方法。

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Conclusion: 研究表明，代理性AI可以通过在现实的DAO治理环境中产生可解释、可审计且基于实证的信号，增强集体决策能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

Motivation: 解决恐慌发作时及时干预的数据集稀缺问题，并提升心理急救效果。

Conclusion: PACER模型在恐慌场景中表现出色，优于通用、CBT基础和GPT-4驱动的模型，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuroGenPoisoning框架，通过神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，显著提高RAG中毒成功率并解决知识冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法主要忽略模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分研究RAG中毒的底层机制及与强参数化知识冲突的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 该方法首先识别一组与上下文中毒知识强相关的Poison-Responsive Neurons，随后利用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元。框架还通过观察到的归因信号识别并重用有潜力但初始未成功的外部知识变体，实现了大规模有效中毒知识的生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个模型和数据集上实现了超过90%的Population Overwrite Success Rate（POSR），同时保持了流畅性，并有效解决了知识冲突。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的攻击框架NeuroGenPoisoning，通过结合LLM内部神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，显著提高了RAG系统中的知识覆盖成功率（POSR）并有效解决了知识冲突问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

Motivation: 在领域特定任务中，如何设计最优提示和推理过程以整合领域知识、提升推理效率并为专家提供知识整合提示是关键但未解决的挑战。

Method: EGO-Prompt结合专家定义的语义因果图（SCG）和因果引导的文本梯度过程，通过迭代优化算法自动优化SCG和推理机制。

Result: EGO-Prompt在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中表现出色，F1分数比前沿方法高出7.32%-12.61%，且能以低于原成本20%的代价使小型模型达到大型模型的性能。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt框架通过自动优化提示和推理过程，显著提升了领域特定任务中大型语言模型的性能，同时降低了成本并增强了可解释性。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在需要非确定性行为的应用中（如人类行为模拟、内容多样化、多人游戏）表现不佳，且输出多样性不足，SSoT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出 String Seed of Thought (SSoT) 提示方法，通过生成随机字符串并从中提取随机性来增强LLMs的多样性输出。

Result: 实验表明，SSoT 显著改善了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想表现，并在开放性任务中增强了响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT 是一种有效的提示方法，显著提升了LLMs在概率指令跟随（PIF）任务中的表现，尤其在保持多样性和遵循特定约束方面。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

Motivation: 解决预训练视觉语言模型在动态环境和新兴类别中面临的分布偏移和新任务挑战，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: NuSA-CL 采用低秩适应和约束任务特定权重更新到模型当前参数的近似零空间中的策略。

Result: 实验表明，NuSA-CL 不仅有效保留了零样本迁移能力，还在持续学习基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL 是一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，适用于现实世界中不断演化的零样本视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人类经验、统计方法或图形标准方法，容易出错且假设理想化，且在多变量时间序列中存在严重的数据缺口。

Method: Shylock 使用分组扩张卷积和共享内核来指数级减少参数数量，同时学习具有时间延迟的变量表示。

Conclusion: Shylock 是一种在少样本和正常多变量时间序列中都能有效发现因果关系的新方法，通过结合全局和局部约束，显著提高了准确性。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Result: 综述了OOD检测技术及其在安全关键领域的应用，提出了生命周期中的集成方法和注意事项。

Conclusion: 论文总结了自主系统安全开发中的挑战和未来研究方向，强调了OOD检测在安全论证中的重要性。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感，导致在不同游戏中节点的Q值跨幅度差异。本文旨在提出适应性选择$\lambda$的策略，使其对奖励尺度不敏感。

Method: 评估了文献中提出的$\lambda$-策略以及五种新策略，通过实验比较它们在各种任务中的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，新提出的$\lambda$-策略（$\lambda = 2 \cdot \sigma$）在单参数值和峰值性能上均优于现有策略。

Conclusion: 论文推荐使用新提出的$\lambda$-策略，即选择$\lambda$为$2 \cdot \sigma$，其中$\sigma$是搜索树中所有状态-动作对Q值的经验标准差。该方法在广泛任务中优于现有策略。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但存在严重的安全风险，如有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，常抑制推理能力且无法解决安全-推理权衡问题。

Method: 提出了Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG)训练框架，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹，同时保留有效的推理链。

Result: 在多推理和安全基准测试中，CoG显著提高了LRMs的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力。

Conclusion: CoG训练框架显著提升了现有LRMs的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的神经符号体现任务规划框架通过结合显式符号验证和交互式验证过程，显著提升了动态或部分可观察环境中任务规划的可靠性和成功率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on trustworthy AI often adopts techno-centric approaches, overlooking sociotechnical dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.

Method: A scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings, analyzing how trustworthiness is defined, operationalized, and applied across different research domains.

Result: Significant progress in defining technical attributes like transparency and robustness, but critical gaps exist where social and ethical considerations are often overshadowed by technical precision.

Conclusion: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing trustworthy AI. Actionable measures are proposed to adopt holistic frameworks addressing the complex interplay between AI systems and society.

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with

### [121] [Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21560)
*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于ICL训练的神经CBF方法，用于安全分类系统状态，实验证明其性能优于基线且接近真实标签训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域自主系统中，安全是基本要求。传统优化方法计算成本高，且失败状态集难以形式化定义，而专家演示数据更易生成。

Method: 使用ICL训练约束函数以分类系统状态为安全或非安全，并利用该函数标注模拟轨迹数据来训练神经CBF。

Result: 在四种不同环境中，该方法优于现有基线，且与基于真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于ICL训练的神经网络控制屏障函数（CBF）方法，用于安全分类系统状态，并在四种不同环境中验证其性能优于现有基线，且与基于真实安全标签训练的神经CBF性能相当。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

Motivation: 现有CXR诊断模型难以适应新任务和复杂推理场景，且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制。

Method: 提出CXRAgent，一个由中央协调器主导的多阶段代理，包括工具调用、诊断规划和协作决策三个阶段，结合证据驱动验证器和专家团队协作。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和视觉证据验证，显著提升了CXR诊断的适应性和可信度，实验证明其在多种任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

TL;DR: Magellan框架通过MCTS和分层引导系统，提升LLM生成创新科学创意的能力，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成创新想法时依赖高概率、熟悉概念的局限性，以及现有搜索方法（如ToT）依赖不一致的自我评估启发式的问题。

Method: Magellan采用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）和分层引导系统，包括用于长距离导向的‘语义指南针’和用于局部决策的景观感知价值函数。

Result: Magellan在生成科学创意方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等基线方法，表现出更高的合理性和创新性。

Conclusion: Magellan框架通过有原则的引导搜索，显著提升了LLM在生成科学创意方面的表现，证明了在创造性发现中，有引导的搜索比无约束的自主性更有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

TL;DR: 结合SFT和RL的框架提升了小模型在数学推理中的性能，减少了token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放方法因其计算效率和参数无关的训练而流行，但依赖长上下文推理轨迹的监督微调会导致小模型性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的框架，通过仅使用1.5K训练样本来提升1.5B模型在数学推理中的性能。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，准确性更高且token使用量减少40%以上。

Conclusion: 结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的框架在数学推理任务中表现更优，不仅提高了准确性，还显著减少了40%以上的token使用量。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在高风险领域表现出色，但其缺乏透明度的问题仍未解决。现有的NeSy AI方法主要针对传统神经网络，不适用于LLMs的特性。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出一种新的符号集成分类法和路线图，为未来研究提供了方向，旨在增强LLMs的透明度。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决复杂优化问题的手动建模和求解效率低下的问题，提出了一个自动化框架AutoOpt，并创建了AutoOpt-11k数据集以支持其训练和测试。

Method: AutoOpt框架包含三个模块：M1（图像转文本，使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别）、M2（文本转文本，使用微调的小型LLM生成PYOMO脚本）、M3（优化，使用双层优化分解方法解决问题）。

Result: AutoOpt在数学表达式识别任务上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat，其BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt框架通过结合深度学习模型和优化算法，能够高效自动解决复杂的优化问题，其性能优于现有方法如ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat，以及传统优化算法。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Motivation: 现有的多任务VRP神经方法通常学习统一的求解器，但忽视了VRP变体可分解为共同基础变体的组合结构，导致无法充分利用专业化基础求解器的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种状态可分解的MDP（SDMDP）框架，通过将状态空间表示为基础VRP变体的笛卡尔积来优化求解器。进一步开发了基于潜在空间的SDMDP扩展，结合最优基础策略和可学习的混合函数，实现策略在潜在空间中的复用。

Conclusion: MoSES框架通过利用基础VRP变体的专业化求解器，显著提升了多任务车辆路径问题的解决效率，并在实验中展现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

Conclusion: 论文鼓励未来的工作扩展智能体安全基准到不同的法律管辖区，以及多轮和多语言交互。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

TL;DR: Co-Sight 通过冲突感知验证和结构化事实模块，显著提升了LLM代理的长程推理可靠性，并在多个基准测试中取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的代理在长程推理中因中间推理验证不足而导致的失败问题。

Method: Co-Sight 通过两种互补机制实现：冲突感知元验证（CAMV）和结构化事实的可信推理（TRSF）。CAMV 将验证转化为冲突识别和针对性证伪，而 TRSF 通过结构化事实模块持续组织和验证证据。

Result: 在 GAIA（84.4%）、Humanity's Last Exam（35.5%）和 Chinese-SimpleQA（93.8%）上取得了最先进的准确率。

Conclusion: Co-Sight 提出了一种可扩展的范式，通过结合结构化事实和冲突感知验证，显著提高了基于LLM的代理在长程推理中的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

Motivation: 发现自我改进潜力（metaproductivity）与编码基准性能之间的不匹配，提出CMP指标作为改进潜力指标。

Method: 提出了Huxley-Gödel Machine（HGM），通过估计CMP并以此为指导搜索自我修改树。

Result: HGM在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot上表现优于现有方法，且使用更少时间。

Conclusion: HGM在多个编码数据集和大语言模型上展现出强大的迁移能力，优化后的代理在SWE-bench Lite上达到人类水平性能。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Conclusion: DeepAgent在多个基准测试中表现优于基线，为现实世界应用中的通用智能代理迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

Motivation: 现有的简单成对等价映射无法实现相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成，因此需要一种能够处理复杂多本体匹配（CMOM）的策略，以建立更细致的等价关系和本体层次结构中的来源。

Method: CMOMgen采用检索增强生成（Retrieval-Augmented Generation）技术，选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配的参考映射作为示例，以增强上下文学习。

Result: CMOMgen在三个生物医学任务中表现出色，F1分数最低为63%，在两项任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三项任务中排名第二。手动评估显示，46%的非参考映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen是一种端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义正确的映射，无需限制目标本体或实体的数量。在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类选择方面优于基线，并在大多数任务中表现最佳，证明了其构建语义正确映射的能力。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

TL;DR: 论文构建了一个多模态数据集，用于分析能源公司的公共关系框架，展示了当前视觉语言模型在识别特定框架上的局限性，并提出了未来改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是理解公司公共关系活动中的框架及其变化，尤其是在能源领域，以识别‘绿色洗涤’等行为。

Method: 论文的方法是通过收集Facebook和YouTube上的专家标注视频广告，构建了一个包含13种框架类型、覆盖50多家公司或倡导团体和20个国家的数据集。

Result: 结果表明，GPT-4.1在检测环境信息方面表现较好（79% F1分数），而最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是提出的基准数据集为能源领域战略沟通的多模态分析研究做出了贡献，并为未来在视觉语言模型（VLM）方面的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

Motivation: 动态环境中自主代理的协调受到高级任务目标与低级规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟的阻碍。

Method: 引入了一个以知识图谱为中心的框架，其双平面架构将声明性事实编译为每个代理的、任务感知的“世界观”和物理感知的遍历规则，从而将任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 通过墨西哥湾的自主水下车辆（AUVs）案例研究，直观展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同的声明性策略产生了独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了知识图谱（KG）不仅作为数据存储库，而且作为强大的状态协调器，用于创建自适应和可解释的自主系统。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFL因服务器与客户端间的依赖关系导致严重的straggler问题，影响系统可扩展性和效率。

Method: 提出MU-SplitFed算法，采用非平衡更新机制，允许服务器在每轮客户端通信中执行τ次本地更新。

Result: MU-SplitFed在非凸目标下达到O(√d/(τT))的收敛速率，实验显示其能有效减轻straggler影响。

Conclusion: MU-SplitFed通过解耦训练进度与慢节点延迟，有效缓解了SFL中的straggler问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables scalable training on edge devices by
combining the parallelism of Federated Learning (FL) with the computational
offloading of Split Learning (SL). Despite its great success, SFL suffers
significantly from the well-known straggler issue in distributed learning
systems. This problem is exacerbated by the dependency between Split Server and
clients: the Split Server side model update relies on receiving activations
from clients. Such synchronization requirement introduces significant time
latency, making straggler a critical bottleneck to the scalability and
efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem, we propose MU-SplitFed, a
straggler-resilient SFL algorithm in zeroth-order optimization that decouples
training progress from straggler delays via a simple yet effective unbalanced
update mechanism.
  By enabling the server to perform $\tau$ local updates per client round,
MU-SplitFed achieves a convergence rate of $O(\sqrt{d/(\tau T)})$ for
non-convex objectives, demonstrating a linear speedup of $\tau$ in
communication rounds. Experiments demonstrate that MU-SplitFed consistently
outperforms baseline methods with the presence of stragglers and effectively
mitigates their impact through adaptive tuning of $\tau$. The code for this
project is available at https://github.com/Johnny-Zip/MU-SplitFed.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种解决方案，通过智能知识系统将高级SLA自动转换为供应商中立指标，使云消费者能够在多云环境中透明地利用多云优势。

Abstract: Cloud computing has been consolidated as a support for the vast majority of
current and emerging technologies. However, there are some barriers that
prevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the
major cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms
that ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.
However, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud
provider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined
to ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are
bound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and
prevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud
environments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically
translating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured
across multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent
knowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs
defined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral
metrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system).
Secondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can
be measured for the different cloud providers. Finally, we report a validation
based on two use cases (IaaS and PaaS) in a multi-cloud environment formed by
leading cloud providers. This evaluation has demonstrated that, thanks to the
complementarity of the two solutions, cloud consumers can automatically and
transparently exploit the multi-cloud in many application domains, as endorsed
by the cloud experts consulted in the course of this study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle challenges in smart prediction and recommendation applications, such as high response time, compromised data privacy, and data scarcity, by leveraging GANs and FL.

Method: The paper integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) with federated learning (FL) in both centralized and decentralized approaches within an edge computing paradigm. GANs are used to generate synthetic datasets to address data scarcity and class imbalance.

Result: The proposed framework improves prediction accuracy by 12% and reduces response time by 73% compared to conventional systems.

Conclusion: The proposed Generative Federated Learning (GFL) framework significantly improves prediction accuracy and reduces response time in heart health monitoring applications, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generative adversarial network and federated
learning-based model to address various challenges of the smart prediction and
recommendation applications, such as high response time, compromised data
privacy, and data scarcity. The integration of the generative adversarial
network and federated learning is referred to as Generative Federated Learning
(GFL). As a case study of the proposed model, a heart health monitoring
application is considered. The realistic synthetic datasets are generated using
the generated adversarial network-based proposed algorithm for improving data
diversity, data quality, and data augmentation, and remove the data scarcity
and class imbalance issues. In this paper, we implement the centralized and
decentralized federated learning approaches in an edge computing paradigm. In
centralized federated learning, the edge nodes communicate with the central
server to build the global and personalized local models in a collaborative
manner. In the decentralized federated learning approach, the edge nodes
communicate among themselves to exchange model updates for collaborative
training. The comparative study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
the existing heart health monitoring applications. The results show that using
the proposed framework (i) the prediction accuracy is improved by 12% than the
conventional framework, and (ii) the response time is reduced by 73% than the
conventional cloud-only system.

Method: 开发了一个通用的语义框架，结合了操作语义和一致性模型，涵盖了多种对象和一致性模型。

Result: 证明了AFC定理，表明对象规范在一致性模型中允许可用实现当且仅当它是仲裁自由的。

Conclusion: 本文提出了仲裁自由一致性（AFC）定理，揭示了仲裁自由是区分无协调一致性与需要同步行为的根本属性。

Abstract: The fundamental tension between \emph{availability} and \emph{consistency}
shapes the design of distributed storage systems. Classical results capture
extreme points of this trade-off: the CAP theorem shows that strong models like
linearizability preclude availability under partitions, while weak models like
causal consistency remain implementable without coordination. These theorems
apply to simple read-write interfaces, leaving open a precise explanation of
the combinations of object semantics and consistency models that admit
available implementations.
  This paper develops a general semantic framework in which storage
specifications combine operation semantics and consistency models. The
framework encompasses a broad range of objects (key-value stores, counters,
sets, CRDTs, and transactional databases) and consistency models (from causal
consistency and sequential consistency to snapshot isolation and transactional
and non-transactional SQL).
  Within this framework, we prove the \emph{Arbitration-Free Consistency} (AFC)
theorem, showing that an object specification within a consistency model admits
an available implementation if and only if it is \emph{arbitration-free}, that
is, it does not require a total arbitration order to resolve visibility or read
dependencies.
  The AFC theorem unifies and generalizes previous results, revealing
arbitration-freedom as the fundamental property that delineates
coordination-free consistency from inherently synchronized behavior.

Motivation: 解决现有分布式哈希表在组大小限制上缺乏理论依据的问题，提升系统在节点变动下的稳定性。

Method: 采用预对等节点重定位技术和动态数据分片机制，结合软硬限制来管理组大小，并通过覆盖网络特性研究分析参数对性能和可扩展性的影响。

Result: 研究表明，软限制和目标区间能有效预防硬限制的违反，提升系统稳定性，同时动态数据分片机制增强了鲁棒性和负载均衡。

Conclusion: Parsley通过引入软限制和动态数据分片机制，显著提升了分布式哈希表的鲁棒性和负载均衡能力，并通过系统化的覆盖网络特性研究为参数配置提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Parsley is a resilient group-based Distributed Hash Table that incorporates a
preemptive peer relocation technique and a dynamic data sharding mechanism to
enhance robustness and balance. In addition to the hard limits on group size,
defined by minimum and maximum thresholds, Parsley introduces two soft limits
that define a target interval for maintaining stable group sizes. These soft
boundaries allow the overlay to take proactive measures to prevent violations
of the hard limits, improving system stability under churn. This work provides
an in-depth analysis of the rationale behind the parameter values adopted for
Parsley's evaluation. Unlike related systems, which specify group size limits
without justification, we conduct a systematic overlay characterization study
to understand the effects of these parameters on performance and scalability.
The study examines topology operations, the behavior of large groups, and the
overall trade-offs observed, offering a grounded explanation for the chosen
configuration values.

Motivation: 当前的计算任务放置方法主要依赖集中式控制器（如Kubernetes），在多组织协作中不适用，且无法适应基础设施的动态变化。

Method: 采用语义名称技术，将计算任务与Kubernetes服务端点进行匹配，实现分散式控制平面。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种分散式控制平面方法，用于在地理上分散的计算集群上放置计算任务，通过使用语义名称来匹配请求与Kubernetes服务端点，从而解决了多组织协作中的集中式控制不足和动态配置问题。

Abstract: Scientific communities are increasingly using geographically distributed
computing platforms. The current methods of compute placement predominantly use
logically centralized controllers such as Kubernetes (K8s) to match tasks to
available resources. However, this centralized approach is unsuitable in
multi-organizational collaborations. Furthermore, workflows often need to use
manual configurations tailored for a single platform and cannot adapt to
dynamic changes across infrastructure. Our work introduces a decentralized
control plane for placing computations on geographically dispersed compute
clusters using semantic names. We assign semantic names to computations to
match requests with named Kubernetes (K8s) service endpoints. We show that this
approach provides multiple benefits. First, it allows placement of
computational jobs to be independent of location, enabling any cluster with
sufficient resources to execute the computation. Second, it facilitates dynamic
compute placement without requiring prior knowledge of cluster locations or
predefined configurations.

Motivation: 分布式云环境中，网络拥塞、不对称带宽和节点间数据混洗等因素常导致应用性能下降，传统的主机级指标无法捕捉这些情况，导致调度决策不佳。

Method: 论文介绍了一种预测和排名机制，通过收集所有节点的实时遥测数据，使用训练好的监督模型估计每个节点的作业持续时间，并对其进行排名以选择最佳放置位置。

Result: 在FABRIC测试床上部署的分布式Kubernetes集群中，与默认调度器相比，所提出的监督调度器在作业放置节点选择上实现了34-54%的更高准确性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于监督学习的网络感知作业调度器，显著提高了在多站点集群中选择最优节点进行作业调度的准确性。

Abstract: Distributed cloud environments hosting data-intensive applications often
experience slowdowns due to network congestion, asymmetric bandwidth, and
inter-node data shuffling. These factors are typically not captured by
traditional host-level metrics like CPU or memory. Scheduling without
accounting for these conditions can lead to poor placement decisions, longer
data transfers, and suboptimal job performance. We present a network-aware job
scheduler that uses supervised learning to predict the completion time of
candidate jobs. Our system introduces a prediction-and-ranking mechanism that
collects real-time telemetry from all nodes, uses a trained supervised model to
estimate job duration per node, and ranks them to select the best placement. We
evaluate the scheduler on a geo-distributed Kubernetes cluster deployed on the
FABRIC testbed by running network-intensive Spark workloads. Compared to the
default Kubernetes scheduler, which makes placement decisions based on current
resource availability alone, our proposed supervised scheduler achieved 34-54%
higher accuracy in selecting optimal nodes for job placement. The novelty of
our work lies in the demonstration of supervised learning for real-time,
network-aware job scheduling on a multi-site cluster.

Conclusion: 本文显著提高了在邻域独立性θ图中(Δ+1)-coloring的计算效率，展示了在θ最多为Δ的多对数时，可在Δ的拟多对数时间内完成。同时，指出了超图边着色方法的局限性。

Abstract: The distributed coloring problem is arguably one of the key problems studied
in the area of distributed graph algorithms. The most standard variant of the
problem asks for a proper vertex coloring of a graph with $\Delta+1$ colors,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Despite an immense amount of
work on distributed coloring problems in the distributed setting, determining
the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring in the standard message
passing model remains one of the most important open questions of the area. In
this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the deterministic complexity
of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring as a function of $\Delta$ in a special family of
graphs for which significantly faster algorithms are already known. The
neighborhood independence $\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise
non-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. In general, in graphs of
neighborhood independence $\theta=O(1)$ (e.g., line graphs), it is known that
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring can be solved in $2^{O(\sqrt{\log\Delta})}+O(\log^* n)$
rounds. In the present paper, we significantly improve this result, and we show
that in graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta$, a $(\Delta+1)$-coloring
can be computed in $(\theta\cdot\log\Delta)^{O(\log\log\Delta /
\log\log\log\Delta)}+O(\log^* n)$ rounds and thus in quasipolylogarithmic time
in $\Delta$ as long as $\theta$ is at most polylogarithmic in $\Delta$. We also
show that the known approach that leads to a polylogarithmic in $\Delta$
algorithm for $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring already fails for edge colorings of
hypergraphs of rank at least $3$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果表示学习（CRL）在理论上有显著进展，但在实际应用中仍存在差距。本文旨在通过机器人姿态估计这一具体问题，缩小这一差距。

Method: ROPES是一种基于分数的无监督因果表示学习框架，通过利用机器人关节的自然干预变化来识别和恢复可控的潜在变量。

Result: ROPES在半合成机械臂实验中成功以高保真度解耦了潜在生成因子，且仅利用了分布变化，无需任何标注数据。

Conclusion: 论文将机器人姿态估计定位为因果表示学习（CRL）的一个近乎实用的测试平台，展示了ROPES框架在无监督条件下成功解耦和恢复可控潜在变量的潜力。

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

systems are designed to predict potential collisions between aircraft and
recommend appropriate avoidance actions. Creating effective collision avoidance
systems requires solutions to a variety of technical challenges related to
surveillance, decision making, and validation. These challenges have sparked
significant research and development efforts over the past several decades that
have resulted in a variety of proposed solutions. This article provides an
overview of these challenges and solutions with an emphasis on those that have
been put through a rigorous validation process and accepted by regulatory
bodies. The challenges posed by the collision avoidance problem are often
present in other domains, and aircraft collision avoidance systems can serve as
case studies that provide valuable insights for a wide range of safety-critical
systems.

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,
requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure
knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully
autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware.
We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying.
To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890
suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework
that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a
benchmark for dexterous imitation learning, we evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT,
and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.
Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in
surgery. These contributions support reproducible evaluation and development of
precision-focused, long-horizon dexterous manipulation policies necessary for
end-to-end suturing. Dataset is available at:

TL;DR: PPC 框架通过规范点云姿态，显著提升了 PC-RL 对相机姿态变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于视觉输入的强化学习近年来取得了显著成功，但其对光照、颜色和视角等分布外变化的脆弱性仍然存在。点云强化学习（PC-RL）虽然减少了基于外观的脆弱性，但对相机姿态不匹配的敏感性仍影响其在现实场景中的可靠性。

Method: 提出了 PPC 框架，专门针对下游机器人控制，将任意刚体变换下的点云映射到唯一规范姿态，对齐观测到一致框架。

Result: 实验表明，PPC 在挑战性机器人任务中提高了对未见相机姿态的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PCA Point Cloud (PPC) 框架通过将点云映射到唯一规范姿态，有效减少了视角引起的不一致性，提高了机器人任务中对未见相机姿态的鲁棒性，为领域随机化提供了原则性替代方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Motivation: 旨在通过人类演示视频让机器人学习操作任务，适应不同环境中的物体摆放差异。

Method: 系统包括数据收集模块（通过AR头显收集视频）、视频理解模块（检测物体并提取3D人手轨迹）、轨迹转移模块（将人手轨迹转换为机器人末端执行器轨迹）和轨迹优化模块（在机器人配置空间中求解轨迹）。

Conclusion: 该系统通过四个模块实现了从人类演示视频到机器人轨迹的有效转移，使机器人能够在不同环境中重复执行相同的移动操作任务。

Abstract: We introduce a novel system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that
enables robots to manipulate objects by learning from human demonstration
videos. The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data
collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from
the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video
understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand
trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand
trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The
last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory
in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory
transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a
robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile
manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed
differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation
tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our
system

Method: 引入了$(ST)^2$方法，一种顺序式教学框架，允许用户通过定义关键点来控制教学流程，实现增量化和结构化的演示。通过用户研究（16名参与者在零售环境中执行补货任务）评估两种方法的效果和用户偏好。

Result: 两种方法在轨迹质量和成功率上表现相似，但用户偏好存在差异：顺序式因其迭代控制受到部分用户青睐，而整体式因简洁性被另一部分用户偏好。

Conclusion: 两种教学方法（整体式和顺序式）在轨迹质量和成功率上表现相似，但用户偏好不同，部分用户喜欢顺序式教学的迭代控制，另一部分则偏好整体式教学的简洁性。

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is effective for teaching robots complex skills
with high sample efficiency. However, teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple
skills is difficult, as deviations accumulate, distributional shift increases,
and human teachers become fatigued, raising the chance of failure. In this
work, we study user responses to two teaching frameworks: (i) a traditional
monolithic approach, where users demonstrate the entire trajectory of a
long-horizon task; and (ii) a sequential approach, where the task is segmented
by the user and demonstrations are provided step by step. To support this
study, we introduce $(ST)^2$, a sequential method for learning long-horizon
manipulation tasks that allows users to control the teaching flow by defining
key points, enabling incremental and structured demonstrations. We conducted a
user study on a restocking task with 16 participants in a realistic retail
environment to evaluate both user preference and method effectiveness. Our
objective and subjective results show that both methods achieve similar
trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the
sequential approach for its iterative control, while others favored the
monolithic approach for its simplicity.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的反应式重新规划方法，利用ASAO算法在变化环境中高效找到全局规划，无需显式重用计划，实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的反应式重新规划方法需要更新现有计划，这在计算上代价高昂且在某些应用中难以实现。本文挑战了这一长期假设，寻求更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新的反应式重新规划方法，将增量规划问题转化为一系列独立问题，利用ASAO算法快速找到初始解并逐步收敛至最优解。

Result: 模拟实验表明，EIT*在找到更短的解决方案路径方面优于其他测试的反应式规划算法，AORRTC在真实机器人手臂规划问题中进一步验证了这一方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过使用快速几乎必然渐近最优（ASAO）规划算法，如Effort Informed Trees（EIT*）和Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect（AORRTC），可以在变化的障碍物环境中高效地找到全局规划方案，而无需显式地重用现有计划。

Abstract: Robots operating in changing environments either predict obstacle changes
and/or plan quickly enough to react to them. Predictive approaches require a
strong prior about the position and motion of obstacles. Reactive approaches
require no assumptions about their environment but must replan quickly and find
high-quality paths to navigate effectively.
  Reactive approaches often reuse information between queries to reduce
planning cost. These techniques are conceptually sound but updating dense
planning graphs when information changes can be computationally prohibitive. It
can also require significant effort to detect the changes in some applications.
  This paper revisits the long-held assumption that reactive replanning
requires updating existing plans. It shows that the incremental planning
problem can alternatively be solved more efficiently as a series of independent
problems using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning
algorithms. These ASAO algorithms quickly find an initial solution and converge
towards an optimal solution which allows them to find consistent global plans
in the presence of changing obstacles without requiring explicit plan reuse.
This is demonstrated with simulated experiments where Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*) finds shorter median solution paths than the tested reactive planning
algorithms and is further validated using Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) on a real-world planning problem on a robot arm.

TL;DR: GSL框架通过对象中心技能桥接高层视觉语言模型和低层视觉运动策略，显著提升机器人操作的泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人操作中策略泛化和样本效率低下的问题。

Method: GSL利用基础模型将演示分解为可转移和对象规范化的技能基元，并在测试时将技能-对象对预测映射回世界坐标系执行。

Result: 在模拟中，GSL仅需每任务3个演示即超越基线30倍数据训练的15.5%；在真实实验中，GSL也优于基线10倍数据训练的结果。

Conclusion: GSL框架通过对象中心技能作为桥梁，显著提升了机器人操作策略的泛化能力和样本效率。

Abstract: We present Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a novel framework
for hierarchical policy learning that significantly improves policy
generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation. One core idea of
GSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level
vision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL
decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill
primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning
in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the
high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical
actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet
flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and
generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object
appearances, and task compositions. In simulation, GSL trained with only 3
demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30 times more data
by 15.5 percent on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses
the baseline trained with 10 times more data.

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，所提出的机器人无关框架在恶劣条件下具有自主自组装和重新配置的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modular robots offer reconfigurability and fault tolerance essential for
lunar missions, but require controllers that adapt safely to real-world
disturbances. We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator
synchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive
velocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time
end-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its
translational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment
without abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based
version and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two
MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate
that the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions,
while the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains
millimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with
differing mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex).
These results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic
framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh
conditions.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于图的多传感器融合SLAM系统在视觉退化环境中表现出色，显著提升了系统的稳定性和定位精度。

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by limited visibility, insufficient lighting, and
feature scarcity in underwater environments presents significant challenges to
visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph-based
visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system that integrates a stereo camera, an
inertial measurement unit (IMU), the Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a pressure
sensor. The key innovation lies in the tight integration of four distinct
sensor modalities to ensure reliable operation, even under degraded visual
conditions. To mitigate DVL drift and improve measurement efficiency, we
propose a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy. At the
frontend, hybrid tracking strategies and acoustic-inertial-depth joint
optimization enhance system stability. Additionally, multi-source hybrid
residuals are incorporated into a graph optimization framework. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed system are conducted in
both simulated and real-world underwater scenarios. The results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial
SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, exhibiting
exceptional robustness, particularly in visually challenging environments.

Conclusion: 该系统通过轻量级消费级DJI无人机和Android应用实现了自主飞行，显著降低了操作复杂性并提高了多无人机协同作业的效率。

Abstract: In recent years, consumer-grade UAVs have been widely adopted by first
responders. In general, they are operated manually, which requires trained
pilots, especially in unknown GNSS-denied environments and in the vicinity of
structures. Autonomous flight can facilitate the application of UAVs and reduce
operator strain. However, autonomous systems usually require special
programming interfaces, custom sensor setups, and strong onboard computers,
which limits a broader deployment.
  We present a system for autonomous flight using lightweight consumer-grade
DJI drones. They are controlled by an Android app for state estimation and
obstacle avoidance directly running on the UAV's remote control. Our ground
control station enables a single operator to configure and supervise multiple
heterogeneous UAVs at once. Furthermore, it combines the observations of all
UAVs into a joint 3D environment model for improved situational awareness.

Abstract: Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary
exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper
introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable
surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion
planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages
joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications.
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing
stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain
probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and
dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made
collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to
traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing
safety.

Conclusion: PREVENT系统通过多模态行为树方法有效解决了移动化学机器人工作流意识不足的问题，避免了误报和漏报，提高了部署准确性。

Abstract: Mobile robotic chemists are a fast growing trend in the field of chemistry
and materials research. However, so far these mobile robots lack workflow
awareness skills. This poses the risk that even a small anomaly, such as an
improperly capped sample vial could disrupt the entire workflow. This wastes
time, and resources, and could pose risks to human researchers, such as
exposure to toxic materials. Existing perception mechanisms can be used to
predict anomalies but they often generate excessive false positives. This may
halt workflow execution unnecessarily, requiring researchers to intervene and
to resume the workflow when no problem actually exists, negating the benefits
of autonomous operation. To address this problem, we propose PREVENT a system
comprising navigation and manipulation skills based on a multimodal Behavior
Tree (BT) approach that can be integrated into existing software architectures
with minimal modifications. Our approach involves a hierarchical perception
mechanism that exploits AI techniques and sensory feedback through Dexterous
Vision and Navigational Vision cameras and an IoT gas sensor module for
execution-related decision-making. Experimental evaluations show that the
proposed approach is comparatively efficient and completely avoids both false
negatives and false positives when tested in simulated risk scenarios within
our robotic chemistry workflow. The results also show that the proposed
multi-modal perception skills achieved deployment accuracies that were higher
than the average of the corresponding uni-modal skills, both for navigation and
for manipulation.

Motivation: The integration of AI into sensitive areas necessitates resilient and robust systems to foster trust, particularly among elderly users.

Method: The paper likely explores resilience as the ability to operate under adverse conditions while maintaining essential capabilities.

Result: The paper demonstrates that resilience in social robots is crucial for maintaining trust and operational capabilities in adverse conditions.

Conclusion: Resilience is a fundamental characteristic for social robots, ensuring trust, especially in sensitive contexts like elderly care.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated
into sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and everyday life, it's
crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust. This paper shows how
resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it,
ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating
in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems.
Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful
conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential
operational capabilities.

Conclusion: AURASeg技术在室内外环境中均表现出色，实现了精确的边界细化且对推理速度影响最小，适用于自主感知。

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous
vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained
features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for
robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from
ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited
feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose
Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement
(AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high
segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses
CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for
accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder
(APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context
extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats
benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the
Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor
dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union
(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to
state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for
autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise
border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Abstract: Micro aerial vehicles are becoming increasingly important in search and
rescue operations due to their agility, speed, and ability to access confined
spaces or hazardous areas. However, designing lightweight aerial systems
presents significant structural, aerodynamic, and computational challenges.
This work addresses two key limitations in many low-cost aerial systems under
two kilograms: their lack of structural durability during flight through rough
terrains and inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or
obstacles are detected. We present a fully customised drone built from scratch
using only commonly available components and materials, emphasising modularity,
low cost, and ease of assembly. The structural frame is reinforced with
lightweight yet durable materials to withstand impact, while the onboard
control system is powered entirely by free, open-source software solutions. The
proposed system demonstrates real-time perception and adaptive navigation
capabilities without relying on expensive hardware accelerators, offering an
affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions.
