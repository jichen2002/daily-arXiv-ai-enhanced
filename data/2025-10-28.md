Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

<details>

Motivation: 当前3D可用性理解方法大多局限于基于接触的分析，忽略了方向和空间占用等关键方面，且依赖费时费力的人工标注数据集。

Method: H2OFlow通过点云上的密集扩散过程学习密集3D流表示，从而发现丰富的3D可用性。

Result: H2OFlow在定量和定性评估中显示出对真实世界对象的有效泛化能力，并在建模3D可用性方面超越了依赖人工标注或网格表示的前沿方法。

Conclusion: H2OFlow通过合成数据和3D流表示，全面且高效地建模3D HOI可用性，为计算机视觉、机器人和AI领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

Conclusion: SSL视频世界模型能有效提升视频生成模型的物理合理性，证明了该方法的价值。

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often

Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on

existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D

novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal

AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer

Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly

concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase

However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban

climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can

CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,

storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for

While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Conclusion: UniPAN通过统一训练和测试分布，成功增强了模型的泛化能力，实现了“一次训练，永久部署”的目标。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the
Bicocca25b dataset.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer

operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate
that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像描述任务中存在全局叙事连贯性与丰富细节捕获之间的固有矛盾，尤其是在需要多步和复杂场景描述的任务中表现尤为突出。

Method: 提出TDSR框架，将生成过程建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并设计了针对VLMs的高效蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）算法，结合视觉引导并行扩展和轻量级价值网络。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如DetailCaps、COMPOSITIONCAP、POPE）上，TDSR作为即插即用模块显著提升了现有VLMs（如LLaVA-1.5、Qwen2.5-VL）的性能，在细粒度描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制方面达到或接近最先进水平。

Conclusion: TDSR通过分层规划和高效搜索算法有效解决了VLMs在图像描述任务中的矛盾，为提升复杂场景描述能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

Conclusion: WAGIBench填补了领域空白，证实当前模型与人类表现差距大，需继续改进；多模态信息处理能力已显现潜力。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution

Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The
codes are available at https://github.com/boyiZheng99/PSScreen_V2.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures are important biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness in
histopathology, yet reliable recognition remains challenging due to severe
class imbalance and variability across imaging domains. We present a
DenseNet-121-based framework tailored for atypical mitosis classification in
the MIDOG 2025 (Track 2) setting. Our method integrates stain-aware
augmentation (Macenko), geometric and intensity transformations, and
imbalance-aware learning via weighted sampling with a hybrid objective
combining class-weighted binary cross-entropy and focal loss. Trained
end-to-end with AdamW and evaluated across multiple independent domains, the
model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive
objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis
classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and

second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote

Motivation: 人类自然地将3D世界的几何结构和语义内容视为交织在一起的维度，从而能够连贯且准确地理解复杂场景。然而，大多数先前的方法优先训练大型几何模型进行低级的3D重建，并将高级的空间理解孤立处理，忽视了这两个基本方面的关键相互作用，这限制了泛化能力并导致下游3D理解任务的性能不佳。

Method: 作者设计了3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning策略，引导IGGT通过仅2D视觉输入编码一个统一的表示，包含几何结构和基于实例的聚类。此外，构建了一个名为InsScene-15K的大规模数据集，包含高质量的RGB图像、姿势、深度图和3D一致的实例级掩码注释。

Result: 这种表示支持将2D视觉输入一致地提升为一个具有明确不同对象实例的连贯3D场景。

Conclusion: IGGT通过统一几何结构和实例级上下文理解的知识，解决了先前方法在下游3D理解任务中的性能限制问题。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Abstract: Lipreading has emerged as an increasingly important research area for
developing robust speech recognition systems and assistive technologies for the
hearing-impaired. However, non-English resources for visual speech recognition
remain limited. We introduce LRW-Persian, the largest in-the-wild Persian
word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional
and dialectal coverage, and rich per-clip metadata including head pose, age,
and gender. To ensure large-scale data quality, we establish a fully automated
end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic
Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a
critical gap in low-resource languages, LRW-Persian enables rigorous
benchmarking, supports cross-lingual transfer, and provides a foundation for
advancing multimodal speech research in underrepresented linguistic contexts.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

TL;DR: FairJudge是一种轻量级协议，使用指令跟随多模态LLM作为公平评判者，通过解释导向的评分标准评估图像与提示的对齐性，并关注社会属性的公平性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像（T2I）系统缺乏简单、可复现的方法来评估图像与提示的匹配程度以及模型对社会属性的处理方式。现有代理方法（如面部分类器和对比相似性）仅关注表面线索，缺乏校准的弃权机制，且容易忽略仅微弱可见的属性（如宗教、文化、残疾）。

Method: 提出FairJudge协议，将指令跟随多模态LLM视为公平评判者，采用解释导向的评分标准（映射到[-1, 1]），约束判断为封闭标签集，要求基于可见内容的证据，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: 在FairFace、PaTA、FairCoT等数据集上评估性别、种族和年龄属性；扩展到宗教、文化和残疾属性；并在IdenProf、FairCoT-Professions和新发布的DIVERSIFY-Professions上评估职业正确性和对齐性。结果表明，评判模型在人口统计预测上优于对比和面部中心基线，同时保持高职业准确性。

Conclusion: FairJudge提供了更可靠、可复现的公平性审计方法，能够生成可问责、基于证据的决策，解决了传统评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as

backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language

effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

Motivation: 现有无训练视频编辑方法在DDIM反演过程中依赖启发式帧选择以保持时间一致性，这引入了人为偏差并降低了端到端推理的可扩展性。

Conclusion: VALA是一种高效、可扩展的无训练视频编辑解决方案，可完全集成到基于文本到图像的视频编辑模型中。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they

While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and

guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep

  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative
neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain
adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image
datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic
input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and
integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex
3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing
the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through
rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,
demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features
applicable to various downstream tasks.
  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image
analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on

deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Abstract: Medical image analysis is central to drug discovery and preclinical
evaluation, where scalable, objective readouts can accelerate decision-making.
We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast
microscopy of C6 glioma cells -- a task with subtle dose differences that
challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation
pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image
label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and
improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance
model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for
future medical image research. Code is released to facilitate reproduction and
extension.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning

and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental

exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The
code will be made available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/MERGE

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

Conclusion: FARMER有效统一了NF和AR模型优势，在图像生成质量与效率间取得平衡，同时保持似然计算的精确性。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,

this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural

commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: DSA significantly outperforms existing methods in simulating human survey responses by aligning distribution shifts and reducing the need for real data by 53.48-69.12%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey

However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial

reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in logistics. Solving large-scale

introduces a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement framework that

The reduced problem is solved with classical heuristics and subsequently
expanded back into the original space with feasibility corrections. Preliminary

reduces computation time while preserving or improving solution quality,
particularly with respect to capacity and time window constraints. The paper
also explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques,

The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and
the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed

To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic

contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically

Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning

catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

Result: 对多个基线的广泛评估显示：(1) 单模态方法（基于文本的知识擦除）在多模态谣言上失效；(2) 遗忘效果主要由灾难性遗忘驱动；(3) 所有方法都难以处理“视觉谣言”（谣言出现在图像中）；(4) 被遗忘的谣言很容易恢复；(5) 所有方法都容易受到提示攻击。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了当前方法的重要漏洞，凸显了对更鲁棒的多模态遗忘解决方案的需求。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a

how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in

struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in

presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in

as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Motivation: Current MLLMs show imbalanced reasoning by over-relying on text and under-utilizing visuals, limiting performance in visual tasks.

Method: Analyzed the gap via training recipes, explored bridging strategies from data and loss design perspectives.

Result: Identified training factors that widen the gap and proposed methods to promote balanced multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Insights provided for recipes that mitigate the modality gap, enhancing balanced reasoning; code is open-sourced.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is

Abstract: A cascaded online learning flight control system has been developed and
enhanced with respect to action smoothness. In this paper, we investigate the
convergence performance of the control system, characterized by the increment
of a Lyapunov function candidate. The derivation of this metric accounts for
discretization errors and state prediction errors introduced by the incremental
model. Comparative results are presented through flight control simulations.

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,

and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity--robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step

trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL

introducing a unified, six-stage methodological framework that deconstructs the
end-to-end scientific process into: Literature Review, Idea Generation,
Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper

early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems
(2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and
Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these

science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining
challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's

benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate

widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement

the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's

promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with

uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is

Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Interactive applications demand believable characters that respond naturally
to dynamic environments. Traditional character animation techniques often
struggle to handle arbitrary situations, leading to a growing trend of
dynamically selecting motion-captured animations based on predefined features.
While Motion Matching has proven effective for locomotion by aligning to target
trajectories, animating environment interactions and crowd behaviors remains
challenging due to the need to consider surrounding elements. Existing
approaches often involve manual setup or lack the naturalism of motion capture.
Furthermore, in crowd animation, body animation is frequently treated as a
separate process from trajectory planning, leading to inconsistencies between
body pose and root motion. To address these limitations, we present
Environment-aware Motion Matching, a novel real-time system for full-body
character animation that dynamically adapts to obstacles and other agents,
emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between pose and trajectory. In a
preprocessing step, we extract shape, pose, and trajectory features from a
motion capture database. At runtime, we perform an efficient search that
matches user input and current pose while penalizing collisions with a dynamic
environment. Our method allows characters to naturally adjust their pose and
trajectory to navigate crowded scenes.

Abstract: Human motion is fundamentally driven by continuous physical interaction with
the environment. Whether walking, running, or simply standing, the forces
exchanged between our feet and the ground provide crucial insights for
understanding and reconstructing human movement. Recent advances in wearable
insole devices offer a compelling solution for capturing these forces in
diverse, real-world scenarios. Sensor insoles pose no constraint on the users'
motion (unlike mocap suits) and are unaffected by line-of-sight limitations (in
contrast to optical systems). These qualities make sensor insoles an ideal
choice for robust, unconstrained motion capture, particularly in outdoor
environments. Surprisingly, leveraging these devices with recent motion
reconstruction methods remains largely unexplored. Aiming to fill this gap, we
present Step2Motion, the first approach to reconstruct human locomotion from
multi-modal insole sensors. Our method utilizes pressure and inertial
data-accelerations and angular rates-captured by the insoles to reconstruct
human motion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of
experiments to show its versatility for diverse locomotion styles, from simple
ones like walking or jogging up to moving sideways, on tiptoes, slightly
crouching, or dancing.

especially when instructions are underspecified or context-dependent. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ToM-SWE, a dual-agent architecture that pairs a primary
software-engineering (SWE) agent with a lightweight theory-of-mind (ToM)
partner agent dedicated to modeling the user's mental state. The ToM agent
infers user goals, constraints, and preferences from instructions and
interaction history, maintains a \textbf{persistent memory} of the user, and
provides user-related suggestions to the SWE agent. In two software engineering
benchmarks (ambiguous SWE-bench and stateful SWE-bench), ToM-SWE improves task
success rates and user satisfaction. Notably, on the stateful SWE benchmark, a
newly introduced evaluation that provides agents with a user simulator along
with previous interaction histories, ToM-SWE achieves a substantially higher
task success rate of 59.7\% compared to 18.1\% for OpenHands, a
state-of-the-art SWE agent. Furthermore, in a three-week study with
professional developers using ToM-SWE in their daily work, participants found
it useful 86\% of the time, underscoring the value of stateful user modeling

RAG-assisted responses were more comprehensive than human developers (62.50% to

Abstract: Stack Overflow (SO), a leading online community forum, is a rich source of
software development knowledge. However, locating architectural knowledge, such
as architectural solutions remains challenging due to the overwhelming volume
of unstructured content and fragmented discussions. Developers must manually
sift through posts to find relevant architectural insights, which is
time-consuming and error-prone. This study introduces ArchISMiner, a framework
for mining architectural knowledge from SO. The framework comprises two
complementary components: ArchPI and ArchISPE. ArchPI trains and evaluates
multiple models, including conventional ML/DL models, Pre-trained Language
Models (PLMs), and Large Language Models (LLMs), and selects the
best-performing model to automatically identify Architecture-Related Posts
(ARPs) among programming-related discussions. ArchISPE employs an indirect
supervised approach that leverages diverse features, including BERT embeddings
and local TextCNN features, to extract architectural issue-solution pairs. Our
evaluation shows that the best model in ArchPI achieves an F1-score of 0.960 in
ARP detection, and ArchISPE outperforms baselines in both SE and NLP fields,
achieving F1-scores of 0.883 for architectural issues and 0.894 for solutions.
A user study further validated the quality (e.g., relevance and usefulness) of
the identified ARPs and the extracted issue-solution pairs. Moreover, we
applied ArchISMiner to three additional forums, releasing a dataset of over 18K
architectural issue-solution pairs. Overall, ArchISMiner can help architects

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection (LogAD) is critical for maintaining the
reliability and availability of large-scale online service systems. While
machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs)-based methods
have advanced the LogAD, they often suffer from limited interpretability, high
inference costs, and extensive preprocessing requirements, limiting their
practicality for real-time, high-volume log analysis. In contrast, rule-based
systems offer efficiency and transparency, but require significant manual
effort and are difficult to scale across diverse and evolving environments. In
this paper, We present CodeAD, a novel framework that automatically synthesizes
lightweight Python rule functions for LogAD using LLMs. CodeAD introduces a
hierarchical clustering and anchor-grounded sampling strategy to construct
representative contrastive log windows, enabling LLMs to discern discriminative
anomaly patterns. To ensure robustness and generalizability, CodeAD employs an
agentic workflow that iteratively generates, tests, repairs, and refines the
rules until it meets correctness and abstraction requirements. The synthesized
rules are interpretable, lightweight, and directly executable on raw logs,
supporting efficient and transparent online anomaly detection. Our
comprehensive experiments on three public datasets (BGL, Hadoop, Thunderbird)
demonstrate that CodeAD achieves an average absolute improvement of 3.6% F1
score over the state-of-the-art baselines, while processing large datasets up
to 4x faster and at a fraction of the cost (total LLM invocation cost under 4
USD per dataset). These results highlight CodeAD as a practical and scalable
solution for online monitoring systems, enabling interpretable, efficient, and
automated LogAD in real-world environment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are establishing new paradigms for engineering
applications by enabling natural language control of complex computational
workflows. This paper introduces FeaGPT, the first framework to achieve
complete geometry-mesh-simulation workflows through conversational interfaces.
Unlike existing tools that automate individual FEA components, FeaGPT
implements a fully integrated Geometry-Mesh-Simulation-Analysis (GMSA) pipeline
that transforms engineering specifications into validated computational results
without manual intervention. The system interprets engineering intent,
automatically generates physics-aware adaptive meshes, configures complete FEA
simulations with proper boundary condition inference, and performs
multi-objective analysis through closed-loop iteration.
  Experimental validation confirms complete end-to-end automation capability.
Industrial turbocharger cases (7-blade compressor and 12-blade turbine at
\SI{110000}{rpm}) demonstrate the system successfully transforms natural
language specifications into validated CalculiX simulations, producing
physically realistic results for rotating machinery analysis. Additional
validation through 432 NACA airfoil configurations confirms scalability for
parametric design exploration. These results demonstrate that natural language
interfaces can effectively democratize access to advanced computational
engineering tools while preserving analytical rigor.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping enterprise architecture work in agile
software organizations, yet evidence on its effects remains scattered. We
report a systematic literature review (SLR), following established SLR
protocols of Kitchenham and PRISMA, of 1,697 records, yielding 33 studies
across enterprise, solution, domain, business, and IT architect roles. GenAI
most consistently supports (i) design ideation and trade-off exploration; (ii)
rapid creation and refinement of artifacts (e.g., code, models, documentation);
and (iii) architectural decision support and knowledge retrieval. Reported
risks include opacity and bias, contextually incorrect outputs leading to
rework, privacy and compliance concerns, and social loafing. We also identify
emerging skills and competencies, including prompt engineering, model
evaluation, and professional oversight, and organizational enablers around
readiness and adaptive governance. The review contributes with (1) a mapping of
GenAI use cases and risks in agile architecting, (2) implications for
capability building and governance, and (3) an initial research agenda on
human-AI collaboration in architecture. Overall, the findings inform
responsible adoption of GenAI that accelerates digital transformation while
safeguarding architectural integrity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Automated unit test generation is essential for robust software development,
yet existing approaches struggle to generalize across multiple programming
languages and operate within real-time development. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution, their ability to generate high coverage test
code depends on prompting a concise context of the focal method. Current
solutions, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation, either rely on imprecise
similarity-based searches or demand the creation of costly, language-specific
static analysis pipelines. To address this gap, we present LSPRAG, a framework
for concise-context retrieval tailored for real-time, language-agnostic unit
test generation. LSPRAG leverages off-the-shelf Language Server Protocol (LSP)
back-ends to supply LLMs with precise symbol definitions and references in real
time. By reusing mature LSP servers, LSPRAG provides an LLM with language-aware
context retrieval, requiring minimal per-language engineering effort. We
evaluated LSPRAG on open-source projects spanning Java, Go, and Python.
Compared to the best performance of baselines, LSPRAG increased line coverage
by up to 174.55% for Golang, 213.31% for Java, and 31.57% for Python.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into safety-critical systems
introduces a new reliability paradigm: silent failures, where AI produces
confident but incorrect outputs that can be dangerous. This paper introduces
the Formal Assurance and Monitoring Environment (FAME), a novel framework that
confronts this challenge. FAME synergizes the mathematical rigor of offline
formal synthesis with the vigilance of online runtime monitoring to create a
verifiable safety net around opaque AI components. We demonstrate its efficacy
in an autonomous vehicle perception system, where FAME successfully detected
93.5% of critical safety violations that were otherwise silent. By
contextualizing our framework within the ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 8800 standards,
we provide reliability engineers with a practical, certifiable pathway for
deploying trustworthy AI. FAME represents a crucial shift from accepting
probabilistic performance to enforcing provable safety in next-generation
systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Developers often opt for easier but non-optimal implementation to meet
deadlines or create rapid prototypes, leading to additional effort known as
technical debt to improve the code later. Oftentimes, developers explicitly
document the technical debt in code comments, referred to as Self-Admitted
Technical Debt (SATD). Numerous researchers have investigated the impact of
SATD on different aspects of software quality and development processes.
However, most of these studies focus on SATD in production code, often
overlooking SATD in the test code or assuming that it shares similar
characteristics with SATD in production code. In fact, a significant amount of
SATD is also present in the test code, with many instances not fitting into
existing categories for the production code. This study aims to fill this gap
and disclose the nature of SATD in the test code by examining its distribution
and types. Moreover, the relation between its presence and test quality is also
analyzed. Our empirical study, involving 17,766 SATD comments (14,987 from
production code, 2,779 from test code) collected from 50 repositories,
demonstrates that while SATD widely exists in test code, it is not directly
associated with test smells. Our study also presents comprehensive categories
of SATD types in the test code, and machine learning models are developed to
automatically classify SATD comments based on their types for easier
management. Our results show that the CodeBERT-based model outperforms other
machine learning models in terms of recall and F1-score. However, the
performance varies on different types of SATD.

Abstract: While AI coding tools have demonstrated potential to accelerate software
development, their use in scientific computing raises critical questions about
code quality and scientific validity. In this paper, we provide ten practical
rules for AI-assisted coding that balance leveraging capabilities of AI with
maintaining scientific and methodological rigor. We address how AI can be
leveraged strategically throughout the development cycle with four key themes:
problem preparation and understanding, managing context and interaction,
testing and validation, and code quality assurance and iterative improvement.
These principles serve to emphasize maintaining human agency in coding
decisions, establishing robust validation procedures, and preserving the domain
expertise essential for methodologically sound research. These rules are
intended to help researchers harness AI's transformative potential for faster
software development while ensuring that their code meets the standards of
reliability, reproducibility, and scientific validity that research integrity

Abstract: Software testing is a critical component in the software engineering field
and is important for software engineering education. Thus, it is vital for
academia to continuously improve and update educational methods to reflect the
current state of the field. The International Software Testing Qualifications
Board (ISTQB) certification framework is globally recognized and widely adopted
in industry and academia. However, ISTQB-based learning has been rarely applied
with recent generative artificial intelligence advances. Despite the growing
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), ISTQB-based learning and
instruction with LLMs have not been thoroughly explored. This paper explores
and evaluates how LLMs can complement the ISTQB framework for higher education.
The findings present four key contributions: (i) the creation of a
comprehensive ISTQB-aligned dataset spanning over a decade, consisting of 28
sample exams and 1,145 questions; (ii) the development of a domain-optimized
prompt that enhances LLM precision and explanation quality on ISTQB tasks;
(iii) a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset; and
(iv) actionable insights and recommendations for integrating LLMs into software
testing education. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs in supporting
ISTQB certification preparation and offer a foundation for their broader use in
software engineering at higher education.

codebases. Due to lack of commenting standards, their comments are often
useless, and increase the time taken to further maintain codes. This study
intends to find the usefulness of large language models (LLMs) in these cases
to generate potentially better comments. This study focuses on the feasibility
of design documents as a context for the LLMs to generate more useful comments,
as design documents are often used by maintainers to understand code when
comments do not suffice.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) refers to comments in which developers
explicitly acknowledge code issues, workarounds, or suboptimal solutions. SATD
is known to significantly increase software maintenance effort. While extensive
research has examined SATD in source code, its presence and impact in test code
have received no focused attention, leaving a significant gap in our
understanding of how SATD manifests in testing contexts.
  This study, the first of its kind, investigates SATD in test code by manually
analyzing 50,000 comments randomly sampled from 1.6 million comments across
1,000 open-source Java projects. From this sample, after manual analysis and
filtering, we identified 615 SATD comments and classified them into 15 distinct
categories, building a taxonomy of test code SATD. To investigate whether test
code SATD can be detected automatically, we evaluated existing SATD detection
tools, as well as both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Among the existing
tools, MAT performed the best, albeit with moderate recall. To our surprise,
both open-source and proprietary LLMs exhibited poor detection accuracy,
primarily due to low precision. These results indicate that neither existing
approaches nor current LLMs can reliably detect SATD in test code.
  Overall, this work provides the first large-scale analysis of SATD in test
code, a nuanced understanding of its types, and the limitations of current SATD
detection methods. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on test
code-specific SATD.

Abstract: Conversations around diversity and inclusion in software engineering often
focus on gender and racial disparities. However, the State of the Developer
Nation 2025 survey with 8,717 participants revealed that other forms of
discrimination are similarly prevalent but receive considerably less attention.
This includes discrimination based on age, political perspective, disabilities,
or cognitive differences such as neurodivergence. We conducted a secondary
analysis of 800 open-ended survey responses to examine patterns of perceived
discrimination, as well as related challenges and negative impacts. Our study
covers multiple identity facets, including age, gender, race, and disability.
We found that age- and gender-related discrimination was the most frequently
reported workplace issue, but discrimination based on political and religious
views emerged as further notable concerns. Most of the participants who
identified as female cited gender as the primary source of discrimination,
often accompanied by intersectional factors such as race, political views, age,
or sexual orientation. Discrimination related to caregiving responsibilities
was reported by all gender identities. Regarding the negative impacts of
workplace issues, many participants described modifying their appearance or
behavior in response to gender biases. Gender also appeared to influence
broader career challenges, as women and non-binary respondents reported
experiencing almost all workplace issues at higher rates, particularly
discrimination (35%) and mental health challenges (62%). Our goal is to raise
awareness in the research community that discrimination in software development
is multifaceted, and to encourage researchers to select and assess relevant
facets beyond age and gender when designing software engineering studies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fault Localization (FL) aims to identify root causes of program failures. FL
typically targets failures observed from test executions, and as such, often
involves dynamic analyses to improve accuracy, such as coverage profiling or
mutation testing. However, for large industrial software, measuring coverage
for every execution is prohibitively expensive, making the use of such
techniques difficult. To address these issues and apply FL in an industrial
setting, this paper proposes AutoCrashFL, an LLM agent for the localization of
crashes that only requires the crashdump from the Program Under Test (PUT) and
access to the repository of the corresponding source code. We evaluate
AutoCrashFL against real-world crashes of SAP HANA, an industrial software
project consisting of more than 35 million lines of code. Experiments reveal
that AutoCrashFL is more effective in localization, as it identified 30%
crashes at the top, compared to 17% achieved by the baseline. Through thorough
analysis, we find that AutoCrashFL has attractive practical properties: it is
relatively more effective for complex bugs, and it can indicate confidence in
its results. Overall, these results show the practicality of LLM agent
deployment on an industrial scale.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cloud-native microservices enable rapid iteration and scalable deployment but
also create complex, fast-evolving dependencies that challenge reliable
diagnosis. Existing root cause analysis (RCA) approaches, even with multi-modal
fusion of logs, traces, and metrics, remain limited in capturing dynamic
behaviors and shifting service relationships. Three critical challenges
persist: (i) inadequate modeling of cascading fault propagation, (ii)
vulnerability to noise interference and concept drift in normal service
behavior, and (iii) over-reliance on service deviation intensity that obscures
true root causes. To address these challenges, we propose DynaCausal, a dynamic
causality-aware framework for RCA in distributed microservice systems.
DynaCausal unifies multi-modal dynamic signals to capture time-varying
spatio-temporal dependencies through interaction-aware representation learning.
It further introduces a dynamic contrastive mechanism to disentangle true fault
indicators from contextual noise and adopts a causal-prioritized pairwise
ranking objective to explicitly optimize causal attribution. Comprehensive
evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that DynaCausal consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods, attaining an average AC@1 of 0.63 with
absolute gains from 0.25 to 0.46, and delivering both accurate and
interpretable diagnoses in highly dynamic microservice environments.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在IDE环境中校准代码生成模型置信度并有效向开发者传达可靠性信号的可行性。研究发现，基于Platt-scaling的通用后校准模型平均并不能提高置信信号可靠性，而个性化校准效果则依赖于用户交互数据量。人机交互设计研究表明，开发者更倾向于在编辑器内通过非数字化的颜色编码指示器来呈现可靠性信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在IDE中的引入，AI生成代码的实用性和可靠性面临挑战。尽管已有研究表明校准可以提高置信度与代码接受度之间的对齐，但缺乏大规模实证支持。本研究旨在探索在IDE环境中应用代码模型校准的可行性。

Method: 1) 技术方面：开发可扩展的校准框架，使用Platt-scaling等方法对开源模型进行后校准，并基于2400万次真实开发者交互数据评估校准效果；2) 人机交互方面：通过多阶段设计研究(包括情景设计、半结构化访谈和问卷调查)收集3名专家设计师和153名专业开发者的反馈。

Result: 1) 通用后校准模型平均不能显著提高置信信号可靠性；个性化校准效果依赖于用户交互数据量；2) 开发者明显偏好通过非数字化的颜色编码指示器在编辑器工作流中呈现可靠性信号。

Conclusion: 在IDE环境中，通用置信度校准方法效果有限，而个性化校准需要足够用户数据支撑。从用户体验角度，非数值化的视觉信号是更有效的可靠性传达方式。这为未来IDE中AI代码辅助工具的设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: The introduction of large language models into integrated development
environments (IDEs) is revolutionizing software engineering, yet it poses
challenges to the usefulness and reliability of Artificial
Intelligence-generated code. Post-hoc calibration of internal model confidences
aims to align probabilities with an acceptability measure. Prior work suggests
calibration can improve alignment, but at-scale evidence is limited. In this
work, we investigate the feasibility of applying calibration of code models to
an in-IDE context. We study two aspects of the problem: (1) the technical
method for implementing confidence calibration and improving the reliability of
code generation models, and (2) the human-centered design principles for
effectively communicating reliability signal to developers. First, we develop a
scalable and flexible calibration framework which can be used to obtain
calibration weights for open-source models using any dataset, and evaluate
whether calibrators improve the alignment between model confidence and
developer acceptance behavior. Through a large-scale analysis of over 24
million real-world developer interactions across multiple programming
languages, we find that a general, post-hoc calibration model based on
Platt-scaling does not, on average, improve the reliability of model confidence
signals. We also find that while dynamically personalizing calibration to
individual users can be effective, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the
volume of user interaction data. Second, we conduct a multi-phase design study
with 3 expert designers and 153 professional developers, combining
scenario-based design, semi-structured interviews, and survey validation,
revealing a clear preference for presenting reliability signals via
non-numerical, color-coded indicators within the in-editor code generation
workflow.

Abstract: Software architecture design is a fundamental part of creating every software

and generate the Context, Container, and Component views of the C4 model.
Quality is assessed with a hybrid evaluation framework: deterministic checks
for structural and syntactic integrity and C4 rule consistency, plus semantic
and qualitative scoring via an LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Tested on five
canonical system briefs, the workflow demonstrates fast C4 model creation,
sustains high compilation success, and delivers semantic fidelity. A comparison
of four state-of-the-art LLMs shows different strengths relevant to
architectural design. This study contributes to automated software architecture

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Library dependencies in software ecosystems play a crucial role in the
development of software. As newer releases of these libraries are published,
developers may opt to pin their dependencies to a particular version. While
pinning may have benefits in ensuring reproducible builds and avoiding breaking
changes, it bears larger risks in using outdated dependencies that may contain
bugs and security vulnerabilities. To understand the frequency and consequences
of dependency pinning, we first define the concepts of stale and fresh pins,
which are distinguished based on how outdated the dependency is relative to the
release date of the project. We conduct an empirical study to show that over
60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries contain stale pins to their
dependencies, with some outdated versions over a year old. These pinned
versions often miss out on security fixes; we find that 10% of all dependency
upgrades in our dataset to the latest minor or patch version would reduce
security vulnerabilities.
  We prototype an approach called Pin-Freshener that can encourage developers
to freshen their pins by leveraging the insight that crowdsourced tests of peer
projects can provide additional signal for the safety of an upgrade. Running
Pin-Freshener on dependency upgrades shows that just 1-5 additional test suites
can provide 35-100% more coverage of a dependency, compared to that of a single
consumer test suite. Our evaluation on real-world pins to the top 500 popular
libraries in Maven shows that Pin-Freshener can provide an additional signal of
at least 5 passing crowdsourced test suites to over 3,000 consumers to safely
perform an upgrade that reduces security vulnerabilities. Pin-Freshener can
provide practical confidence to developers by offering additional signal beyond
their own test suites, representing an improvement over current practices.

Abstract: Agentic code generation requires large language models (LLMs) capable of
complex context management and multi-step reasoning. Prior multi-agent
frameworks attempt to address these challenges through collaboration, yet they
often suffer from rigid workflows and high reasoning recovery costs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TALM (Tree-Structured Multi-Agent
Framework with Long-Term Memory), a dynamic framework that integrates
structured task decomposition, localized re-reasoning, and long-term memory
mechanisms. TALM employs an extensible tree-based collaboration structure. The
parent-child relationships, when combined with a divide-and-conquer strategy,
enhance reasoning flexibility and enable efficient error correction across
diverse task scopes. Furthermore, a long-term memory module enables semantic
querying and integration of prior knowledge, supporting implicit
self-improvement through experience reuse. Experimental results on HumanEval,
BigCodeBench, and ClassEval benchmarks demonstrate that TALM consistently
delivers strong reasoning performance and high token efficiency, highlighting
its robustness and practical utility in complex code generation tasks.

Abstract: [Context and Motivation] Online user feedback provides valuable information
to support requirements engineering (RE). However, analyzing online user
feedback is challenging due to its large volume and noise. Large language
models (LLMs) show strong potential to automate this process and outperform
previous techniques. They can also enable new tasks, such as generating
requirements specifications.
  [Question-Problem] Despite their potential, the use of LLMs to analyze user
feedback for RE remains underexplored. Existing studies offer limited empirical
evidence, lack thorough evaluation, and rarely provide replication packages,
undermining validity and reproducibility.
  [Principal Idea-Results] We evaluate five lightweight open-source LLMs on
three RE tasks: user request classification, NFR classification, and
requirements specification generation. Classification performance was measured
on two feedback datasets, and specification quality via human evaluation. LLMs
achieved moderate-to-high classification accuracy (F1 ~ 0.47-0.68) and
moderately high specification quality (mean ~ 3/5).
  [Contributions] We newly explore lightweight LLMs for feedback-driven
requirements development. Our contributions are: (i) an empirical evaluation of
lightweight LLMs on three RE tasks, (ii) a replication package, and (iii)
insights into their capabilities and limitations for RE.

Abstract: Good code style improves program readability, maintainability, and
collaboration, and is an integral component of software quality. Developers,
however, often cut corners when following style rules, leading to the wide
adoption of tools such as linters in professional software development
projects. Traditional linters like Checkstyle operate using rigid, rule-based
mechanisms that effectively detect many surface-level violations. However, in
most programming languages, there is a subset of style rules that require a
more nuanced understanding of code, and fall outside the scope of such static
analysis. In this paper, we propose Checkstyle+, a hybrid approach that
augments Checkstyle with large language model (LLM) capabilities, to identify
style violations that elude the conventional rule-based analysis. Checkstyle+
is evaluated on a sample of 380 Java code files, drawn from a broader dataset
of 30,800 real-world Java programs sourced from accepted Codeforces

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Validation is a central activity when developing formal specifications.
Similarly to coding, a possible validation technique is to define upfront test
cases or scenarios that a future specification should satisfy or not.
Unfortunately, specifying such test cases is burdensome and error prone, which
could cause users to skip this validation task. This paper reports the results
of an empirical evaluation of using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to
automate the generation of test cases from natural language requirements. In
particular, we focus on test cases for structural requirements of simple domain
models formalized in the Alloy specification language. Our evaluation focuses
on the state-of-art GPT-5 model, but results from other closed- and open-source
LLMs are also reported. The results show that, in this context, GPT-5 is
already quite effective at generating positive (and negative) test cases that
are syntactically correct and that satisfy (or not) the given requirement, and
that can detect many wrong specifications written by humans.

Abstract: The behaviour of neural network components must be proven correct before
deployment in safety-critical systems. Unfortunately, existing neural network
verification techniques cannot certify the absence of faults at the software
level. In this paper, we show how to specify and verify that neural networks
are safe, by explicitly reasoning about their floating-point implementation. In
doing so, we construct NeuroCodeBench 2.0, a benchmark comprising 912 neural
network verification examples that cover activation functions, common layers,
and full neural networks of up to 170K parameters. Our verification suite is
written in plain C and is compatible with the format of the International
Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP). Thanks to it, we can conduct
the first rigorous evaluation of eight state-of-the-art software verifiers on
neural network code. The results show that existing automated verification
tools can correctly solve an average of 11% of our benchmark, while producing
around 3% incorrect verdicts. At the same time, a historical analysis reveals
that the release of our benchmark has already had a significantly positive
impact on the latter.

Abstract: Monitoring machine learning (ML) systems is hard, with standard practice
focusing on detecting distribution shifts rather than their causes. Root-cause
analysis often relies on manual tracing to determine whether a shift is caused
by software faults, data-quality issues, or natural change. We propose ML
System Maps -- causal maps that, through layered views, make explicit the
propagation paths between the environment and the ML system's internals,
enabling systematic attribution of distribution shifts. We outline the approach
and a research agenda for its development and evaluation.

Abstract: A black hole is a harmful node in a graph that destroys any resource entering
it, making its identification a critical task. In the \emph{Black Hole Search
(BHS)} problem, a team of agents operates on a graph $G$ with the objective
that at least one agent must survive and correctly identify an edge incident to
the black hole. Prior work has addressed BHS in arbitrary dynamic graphs under
the restrictive \emph{face-to-face} communication, where agents can exchange
information only when co-located. This constraint significantly increases the
number of agents required to solve the problem. In this work, we strengthen the
capabilities of agents in two ways: (i) granting them \emph{global
communication}, enabling interaction regardless of location, and (ii) equipping
them with \emph{1-hop visibility}, allowing each agent to observe its immediate
neighborhood. These enhancements lead to more efficient solutions for the BHS
problem in dynamic graphs.

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法有效地解决了在不透明机器人模型下的分离问题，为现实中的机器人协作提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We study a recently introduced \textit{unconscious} mobile robot model, where
each robot is associated with a \textit{color}, which is visible to other
robots but not to itself. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, oblivious and
silent, operating in the Euclidean plane under the conventional
\textit{Look-Compute-Move} cycle. A primary task in this model is the
\textit{separation problem}, where unconscious robots sharing the same color
must separate from others, forming recognizable geometric shapes such as
circles, points, or lines. All prior works model the robots as
\textit{transparent}, enabling each to know the positions and colors of all
other robots. In contrast, we model the robots as \textit{opaque}, where a
robot can obstruct the visibility of two other robots, if it lies on the line
segment between them. Under this obstructed visibility, we consider a variant
of the separation problem in which robots, starting from any arbitrary initial
configuration, are required to separate into concentric semicircles. We present
a collision-free algorithm that solves the separation problem under a
semi-synchronous scheduler in $O(n)$ epochs, where $n$ is the number of robots.
The robots agree on one coordinate axis but have no knowledge of $n$.

Abstract: Edge intelligent applications like VR/AR and language model based chatbots
have become widespread with the rapid expansion of IoT and mobile devices.
However, constrained edge devices often cannot serve the increasingly large and
complex deep learning (DL) models. To mitigate these challenges, researchers
have proposed optimizing and offloading partitions of DL models among user
devices, edge servers, and the cloud. In this setting, users can take advantage
of different services to support their intelligent applications. For example,
edge resources offer low response latency. In contrast, cloud platforms provide
low monetary cost computation resources for computation-intensive workloads.
However, communication between DL model partitions can introduce transmission
bottlenecks and pose risks of data leakage. Recent research aims to balance
accuracy, computation delay, transmission delay, and privacy concerns. They
address these issues with model compression, model distillation, transmission
compression, and model architecture adaptations, including internal
classifiers. This survey contextualizes the state-of-the-art model offloading
methods and model adaptation techniques by studying their implication to a
multi-objective optimization comprising inference latency, data privacy, and
resource monetary cost.

Abstract: Mobile edge devices (e.g., AR/VR headsets) typically need to complete timely
inference tasks while operating with limited on-board computing and energy
resources. In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative inference
in wireless edge networks, where energy-constrained edge devices aim to
complete inference tasks within given deadlines. These tasks are carried out
using neural networks, and the edge device seeks to optimize inference
performance under energy and delay constraints. The inference process can be
split between the edge device and an edge server, thereby achieving
collaborative inference over wireless networks. We formulate an inference
utility optimization problem subject to energy and delay constraints, and
propose a novel solution called Bayes-Split-Edge, which leverages Bayesian
optimization for collaborative split inference over wireless edge networks. Our
solution jointly optimizes the transmission power and the neural network split
point. The Bayes-Split-Edge framework incorporates a novel hybrid acquisition
function that balances inference task utility, sample efficiency, and
constraint violation penalties. We evaluate our approach using the VGG19 model
on the ImageNet-Mini dataset, and Resnet101 on Tiny-ImageNet, and real-world
mMobile wireless channel datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that
Bayes-Split-Edge achieves up to 2.4x reduction in evaluation cost compared to
standard Bayesian optimization and achieves near-linear convergence. It also
outperforms several baselines, including CMA-ES, DIRECT, exhaustive search, and
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while matching exhaustive search
performance under tight constraints. These results confirm that the proposed
framework provides a sample-efficient solution requiring maximum 20 function
evaluations and constraint-aware optimization for wireless split inference in
edge computing systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pinwheel problem is a real-time scheduling problem that asks, given $n$
tasks with periods $a_i \in \mathbb{N}$, whether it is possible to infinitely
schedule the tasks, one per time unit, such that every task $i$ is scheduled in
every interval of $a_i$ units. We study a corresponding version of this packing
problem in the covering setting, stylized as the discretized point patrolling
problem in the literature. Specifically, given $n$ tasks with periods $a_i$,
the problem asks whether it is possible to assign each day to a task such that
every task $i$ is scheduled at \textit{most} once every $a_i$ days. The density
of an instance in either case is defined as the sum of the inverses of task
periods. Recently, the long-standing $5/6$ density bound conjecture in the
packing setting was resolved affirmatively. The resolution means any instance
with density at least $5/6$ is schedulable. A corresponding conjecture was made
in the covering setting and renewed multiple times in more recent work. We
resolve this conjecture affirmatively by proving that every discretized point
patrolling instance with density at least $\sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} 1/(2^i + 1)
\approx 1.264$ is schedulable. This significantly improves upon the current
best-known density bound of 1.546 and is, in fact, optimal. We also study the
bamboo garden trimming problem, an optimization variant of the pinwheel
problem. Specifically, given $n$ growth rates with values $h_i \in \mathbb{N}$,
the objective is to minimize the maximum height of a bamboo garden with the
corresponding growth rates, where we are allowed to trim one bamboo tree to
height zero per time step. We achieve an efficient $9/7$-approximation
algorithm for this problem, improving on the current best known approximation
factor of $4/3$.

3) 结合线性草图技术

Result: 1) 理论突破：在O(rn²)时间内达到1/r^1.1‖A‖²‖B‖²误差

3) 实证显示可替代传统MatMul

Conclusion: 通过傅里叶集中引理实现的CKSU多项式低阶近似方案，为LLM等场景提供了卷积求和替代矩阵乘法的可行路径。

Abstract: A longstanding open question in algorithm design is whether "combinatorial"
matrix multiplication algorithms -- avoiding Strassen-like divide-and-conquer
-- can achieve truly subcubic runtime $n^{3-\delta}$. We present an
$O(n^{2.89})$-time exact algorithm, which only sums convolutions in
$\mathbb{Z}_m^k$ (multivariate polynomial multiplications) via FFT, building on
the work of Cohn, Kleinberg, Szegedy and Umans (CKSU'05). While the algorithm
avoids recursion, the asymptotic speedup arises only for impractically large
matrices.
  Motivated by practical applications, we use this baseline to develop a new
framework for fast approximate matrix multiplication (AMM), via low-degree
approximations of the CKSU polynomials. We show that combining the
aforementioned algorithm with black-box linear sketching already breaks the
longstanding linear speed-accuracy tradeoff for AMM (Sarlos'06,
Clarkson-Woodruff'13 ,Pagh'11, Cohn-Lewis'00), achieving
$\frac{1}{r^{1.1}}\|\mathbf{A}\|_F^2\|\mathbf{B}\|_F^2$ error in
$O(rn^2)$-time.
  Our main result is a low-degree approximation scheme for the CKSU
polynomials, based on a Fourier-concentration lemma, yielding substantially
smaller error in the distributional setting where $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}$ come
from an i.i.d product-distribution; For random Gaussian matrices, this
practical AMM algorithm attains smaller error than the best rank-$r$ SVD of the
output matrix $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}$, in time $O(rn^2)$. This is a substantial
improvement over iterative Krylov subspace methods for low-rank approximation.
Our theoretical and empirical results suggest the possibility of replacing
MatMuls with sums of convolutions in LLM training and inference.

Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma is a cornerstone of dimensionality
reduction in Euclidean space, but its applicability to non-Euclidean data has
remained limited. This paper extends the JL lemma beyond Euclidean geometry to
handle general dissimilarity matrices that are prevalent in real-world
applications. We present two complementary approaches: First, we show the JL
transform can be applied to vectors in pseudo-Euclidean space with signature
$(p,q)$, providing theoretical guarantees that depend on the ratio of the $(p,
q)$ norm and Euclidean norm of two vectors, measuring the deviation from
Euclidean geometry. Second, we prove that any symmetric hollow dissimilarity
matrix can be represented as a matrix of generalized power distances, with an
additional parameter representing the uncertainty level within the data. In
this representation, applying the JL transform yields multiplicative
approximation with a controlled additive error term proportional to the
deviation from Euclidean geometry. Our theoretical results provide fine-grained
performance analysis based on the degree to which the input data deviates from
Euclidean geometry, making practical and meaningful reduction in dimensionality
accessible to a wider class of data. We validate our approaches on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of extending
the JL lemma to non-Euclidean settings.

Abstract: Solving integer programs of the form $\min \{\mathbf{x} \mid A\mathbf{x} =

\mathbb{Z}^n \}$ is, in general, $\mathsf{NP}$-hard. Hence, great effort has
been put into identifying subclasses of integer programs that are solvable in
polynomial or $\mathsf{FPT}$ time. A common scheme for many of these integer
programs is a star-like structure of the constraint matrix. The arguably
simplest form that is not a star is a path. We study integer programs where the
constraint matrix $A$ has such a path-like structure: every non-zero
coefficient appears in at most two consecutive constraints. We prove that even
if all coefficients of $A$ are bounded by 8, deciding the feasibility of such
integer programs is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard via a reduction from 3-SAT. Given the
existence of efficient algorithms for integer programs with star-like
structures and a closely related pattern where the sum of absolute values is
column-wise bounded by 2 (hence, there are at most two non-zero entries per
column of size at most 2), this hardness result is surprising.

Abstract: Tree embedding has been a fundamental method in algorithm design with wide
applications. We focus on the efficiency of building tree embedding in various
computational settings under high-dimensional Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^d$. We
devise a new tree embedding construction framework that operates on an
arbitrary metric decomposition with bounded diameter, offering a tradeoff
between distortion and the locality of its algorithmic steps. This framework
works for general metric spaces and may be of independent interest beyond the
Euclidean setting. Using this framework, we obtain a dynamic algorithm that
maintains an $O_\epsilon(\log n)$-distortion tree embedding with update time
$\tilde O(n^\epsilon + d)$ subject to point insertions/deletions, and a
massively parallel algorithm that achieves $O_\epsilon(\log n)$-distortion in
$O(1)$ rounds and total space $\tilde O(n^{1 + \epsilon})$ (for constant
$\epsilon \in (0, 1)$). These new tree embedding results allow for a wide range
of applications. Notably, under a similar performance guarantee as in our tree
embedding algorithms, i.e., $\tilde O(n^\epsilon + d)$ update time and $O(1)$
rounds, we obtain $O_\epsilon(\log n)$-approximate dynamic and MPC algorithms
for $k$-median and earth-mover distance in $\mathbb{R}^d$.

46 out of 50, and imposes stricter conditions than existing revolving-door or
edge-exchange Gray codes for spanning trees of complete graphs. Our recursive
algorithm generates each spanning tree in constant amortized time using
$O(n^2)$ space. In addition, we provide a novel proof of Cayley's formula,
$n^{n-2}$, for the number of spanning trees in a complete graph, derived from
our recursive approach. We extend the algorithm to generate edge-exchange Gray
codes for general graphs with $n$ vertices, achieving $O(n^2)$ time per tree
using $O(n^2)$ space. For specific graph classes, the algorithm can be
optimized to generate edge-exchange Gray codes for spanning trees in constant
amortized time per tree for complete bipartite graphs, $O(n)$-amortized time
per tree for fan graphs, and $O(n)$-amortized time per tree for wheel graphs,

Abstract: In the distributed monitoring model, a data stream over a universe of size
$n$ is distributed over $k$ servers, who must continuously provide certain
statistics of the overall dataset, while minimizing communication with a
central coordinator. In such settings, the ability to efficiently collect a
random sample from the global stream is a powerful primitive, enabling a wide
array of downstream tasks such as estimating frequency moments, detecting heavy
hitters, or performing sparse recovery. Of particular interest is the task of
producing a perfect $L_p$ sample, which given a frequency vector $f \in
\mathbb{R}^n$, outputs an index $i$ with probability
$\frac{f_i^p}{\|f\|_p^p}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{poly}(n)}$. In this paper, we resolve
the problem of perfect $L_p$ sampling for all $p\ge 1$ in the distributed
monitoring model. Specifically, our algorithm runs in $k^{p-1} \cdot
\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ bits of communication, which is optimal up to
polylogarithmic factors.
  Utilizing our perfect $L_p$ sampler, we achieve adversarially-robust
distributed monitoring protocols for the $F_p$ moment estimation problem, where
the goal is to provide a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation to
$f_1^p+\ldots+f_n^p$. Our algorithm uses
$\frac{k^{p-1}}{\varepsilon^2}\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ bits of communication
for all $p\ge 2$ and achieves optimal bounds up to polylogarithmic factors,
matching lower bounds by Woodruff and Zhang (STOC 2012) in the non-robust
setting. Finally, we apply our framework to achieve near-optimal adversarially
robust distributed protocols for central problems such as counting, frequency
estimation, heavy-hitters, and distinct element estimation.

Abstract: We study testing $\pi$-freeness of functions $f:[n]^d\to\mathbb{R}$, where
$f$ is $\pi$-free if there there are no $k$ indices $x_1\prec\cdots\prec x_k\in
[n]^d$ such that $f(x_i)<f(x_j)$ and $\pi(i) < \pi(j)$ for all $i,j \in [k]$,
where $\prec$ is the natural partial order over $[n]^d$. Given
$\epsilon\in(0,1)$, $\epsilon$-testing $\pi$-freeness asks to distinguish
$\pi$-free functions from those which are $\epsilon$-far -- meaning at least
$\epsilon n^d$ function values must be modified to make it $\pi$-free. While
$k=2$ coincides with monotonicity testing, far less is known for $k>2$.
  We initiate a systematic study of pattern freeness on higher-dimensional
grids. For $d=2$ and all permutations of size $k=3$, we design an adaptive
one-sided tester with query complexity $O(n^{4/5+o(1)})$. We also prove general
lower bounds for $k=3$: every nonadaptive tester requires $\Omega(n)$ queries,
and every adaptive tester requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries, yielding the
first super-logarithmic lower bounds for $\pi$-freeness. For the monotone
patterns $\pi=(1,2,3)$ and $(3,2,1)$, we present a nonadaptive tester with
polylogarithmic query complexity, giving an exponential separation between
monotone and nonmonotone patterns (unlike the one-dimensional case).
  A key ingredient in our $\pi$-freeness testers is new erasure-resilient
($\delta$-ER) $\epsilon$-testers for monotonicity over $[n]^d$ with query
complexity $O(\log^{O(d)}n/(\epsilon(1-\delta)))$, where $0<\delta<1$ is an
upper bound on the fraction of erasures. Prior ER testers worked only for
$\delta=O(\epsilon/d)$. Our nonadaptive monotonicity tester is nearly optimal
via a matching lower bound due to Pallavoor, Raskhodnikova, and Waingarten
(Random Struct. Algorithms, 2022). Finally, we show that current techniques
cannot yield sublinear-query testers for patterns of length $4$ even on
two-dimensional hypergrids.

limitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To
address this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with
trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting
in water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest
counting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the
distribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded
individuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the
impact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and
selected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed
six representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle,
spiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And
by comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of
different stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we
determined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting
confidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed
stirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive
frames as feedback to adjust the stirring speed. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study dedicated to investigating the effects of different
stirring trajectories on object counting in the dynamic liquid environment and
to implement adaptive-speed stirring for this type of task. Experimental
results show ...

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolic events due to
impaired function of the left atrial appendage (LAA). Left atrial appendage
closure (LAAC) is a minimally invasive intervention designed to reduce stroke
risk by sealing the LAA with an expandable occluder device. Current deployment
relies on manual catheter control and imaging modalities like fluoroscopy and
transesophageal echocardiography, which carry limitations including radiation
exposure and limited positioning precision. In this study, we leverage a
previously developed force-sensing delivery sheath integrating fiber Bragg
gratings (FBGs) at the interface between the catheter and the occluder.
Combined with electromagnetic (EM) tracking, this setup enables real-time
measurement of interaction forces and catheter tip position during
robot-assisted LAAC deployment in an anatomical phantom. We present a novel
force-displacement profiling method that characterizes occluder deployment
dynamics and identifies key procedural steps without relying on ionizing
radiation. The force profiles reveal low-magnitude interaction forces,
suggesting minimal mechanical stress on the surrounding anatomy. This approach
shows promise in providing clinicians with enhanced intraoperative feedback,
improving deployment outcome. Future work will focus on automating deployment
steps classification and validating the sensing strategy in dynamic, realistic
environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) exhibit
distinct vehicle dynamics. EVs provide rapid acceleration, with electric motors
producing peak power across a wider speed range, and achieve swift deceleration
through regenerative braking. While existing microscopic models effectively
capture the driving behavior of ICE vehicles, a modeling framework that
accurately describes the unique car-following dynamics of EVs is lacking.
Developing such a model is essential given the increasing presence of EVs in
traffic, yet creating an easy-to-use and accurate analytical model remains
challenging.
  To address these gaps, this study develops and validates a Phase-Aware AI
(PAAI) car-following model specifically for EVs. The proposed model enhances
traditional physics-based frameworks with an AI component that recognizes and
adapts to different driving phases, such as rapid acceleration and regenerative
braking. Using real-world trajectory data from vehicles equipped with adaptive
cruise control (ACC), we conduct comprehensive simulations to validate the
model's performance. The numerical results demonstrate that the PAAI model
significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional car-following
models, providing an effective tool for accurately representing EV behavior in
traffic simulations.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel control framework for adaptive cruise control
(ACC) in automated driving, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
and physics-informed constraints. As automated vehicles (AVs) adopt advanced
features like ACC, transportation systems are becoming increasingly intelligent
and efficient. However, existing AV control strategies primarily focus on
optimizing the performance of individual vehicles or platoons, often neglecting
their interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs) and the broader impact on
traffic flow. This oversight can exacerbate congestion and reduce overall
system efficiency. To address this critical research gap, we propose a neural
network-based, socially compliant AV control framework that incorporates social
value orientation (SVO). This framework enables AVs to account for their
influence on HVs and traffic dynamics. By leveraging AVs as mobile traffic
regulators, the proposed approach promotes adaptive driving behaviors that
reduce congestion, improve traffic efficiency, and lower energy consumption.
Within this framework, we define utility functions for both AVs and HVs, which
are optimized based on the SVO of each AV to balance its own control objectives
with broader traffic flow considerations. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting to varying traffic conditions,
thereby enhancing system-wide efficiency. Specifically, when the AV's control
mode shifts from prioritizing energy consumption to optimizing traffic flow
efficiency, vehicles in the following platoon experience at least a 58.99%
increase in individual energy consumption alongside at least a 38.39%
improvement in individual average speed, indicating significant enhancements in
traffic dynamics.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
capabilities in various automation domains, particularly Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) operations, have garnered increasing attention. Current research
remains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most
studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones,
while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems
in real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct
challenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and
landing procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized
operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position
paper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive
demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV
operations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to
orchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key
technical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii)
Route Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner
for waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory
implementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility
through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales:
multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the
current implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that
charts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully
autonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical
prerequisites and research challenges at each stage.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Long-horizon robot manipulation tasks remain challenging for
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies due to drift and exposure bias, often
denoise the entire trajectory with fixed hyperparameters, causing small
geometric errors to compound across stages and offering no mechanism to
allocate extra test-time compute where clearances are tight. To address these
challenges, we introduce FORGE-Tree, a plug-in control layer that couples a
stage-aligned Diffusion Forcing (DF) head with test-time Monte Carlo Tree
Diffusion (MCTD). With a frozen VLA encoder, DF aligns timesteps to subtask
stages; during inference we partially denoise only a target segment while
keeping other tokens frozen, turning trajectory refinement into a sequence of
local edits. We then apply Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion to select the next
segment to refine. A scene graph supplies priors for expansion and geometry
relation-aware scoring for rollouts, yielding tree-structured denoising whose
performance scales with search budget while preserving the executed prefix.
Evaluation on LIBERO, FORGE-Tree improves success rate by 13.4 to 17.2 pp over
the native VLA baselines with both OpenVLA and Octo-Base. Gains remain
consistent under comparable compute budgets, especially on long-horizon
variants. Videos available at: https://taco-group.github.io/FORGE-Tree/

Abstract: We propose Avi, a novel 3D Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture that
reframes robotic action generation as a problem of 3D perception and spatial
reasoning, rather than low-level policy learning. While existing VLA models
primarily operate on 2D visual inputs and are trained end-to-end on
task-specific action policies, Avi leverages 3D point clouds and
language-grounded scene understanding to compute actions through classical
geometric transformations. Most notably, Avi does not train on previous action
tokens, rather, we build upon a 3D Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
generate the next point cloud and explicitly calculate the actions through
classical transformations. This approach enables generalizable behaviors that
are robust to occlusions, camera pose variations, and changes in viewpoint. By
treating the robotic decision-making process as a structured reasoning task
over 3D representations, Avi bridges the gap between high-level language
instructions and low-level actuation without requiring opaque policy learning.
Our preliminary results highlight the potential of 3D vision-language reasoning
as a foundation for scalable, robust robotic systems. Check it out at

Abstract: We introduce J-ORA, a novel multimodal dataset that bridges the gap in robot

human-robot dialogue scenarios. J-ORA is designed to support three critical
perception tasks, object identification, reference resolution, and next-action
prediction, by leveraging a comprehensive template of attributes (e.g.,

reveal that incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves
multimodal perception performance compared to without object attributes.
Despite the improvement, we find that there still exists a gap between
proprietary and open-source VLMs. In addition, our analysis of object
affordances demonstrates varying abilities in understanding object
functionality and contextual relationships across different VLMs. These

Abstract: By 2050, the global demand for assistive care is expected to reach 3.5
billion people, far outpacing the availability of human caregivers. Existing
robotic solutions remain expensive and require technical expertise, limiting
accessibility. This work introduces a low-cost robotic arm for assistive tasks
such as feeding, cleaning spills, and fetching medicine. The system uses
imitation learning from demonstration videos, requiring no task-specific
programming or manual labeling. The robot consists of six servo motors, dual
cameras, and 3D-printed grippers. Data collection via teleoperation with a
leader arm yielded 50,000 video frames across the three tasks. A novel Phased
Action Chunking Transformer (PACT) captures temporal dependencies and segments
motion dynamics, while a Temporal Ensemble (TE) method refines trajectories to
improve accuracy and smoothness. Evaluated across five model sizes and four
architectures, with ten hours of real-world testing, the system achieved over
90% task accuracy, up to 40% higher than baselines. PACT enabled a 5x model
size reduction while maintaining 75% accuracy. Saliency analysis showed
reliance on key visual cues, and phase token gradients peaked at critical
trajectory moments, indicating effective temporal reasoning. Future work will
explore bimanual manipulation and mobility for expanded assistive capabilities.

Abstract: Quadratic programming (QP) underpins real-time robotics by enabling
efficient, constrained optimization in state estimation, motion planning, and
control. In legged locomotion and manipulation, essential modules like inverse
dynamics, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Whole-Body Control (WBC) are
inherently QP-based, demanding reliable solutions amid tight timing, energy,
and computational limits on embedded platforms. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis and benchmarking study of cutting-edge QP solvers for
legged robotics. We begin by formulating the standard convex QP and classify
solvers into four principal algorithmic approaches, including interior-point
methods, active-set strategies, operator splitting schemes, and augmented
Lagrangian approaches. Each solver is examined in terms of algorithmic
structure, computational characteristics, and its ability to exploit problem
structure and warm-starting. Performance is evaluated using publicly available
benchmarks, focusing on metrics such as computation time, constraint
satisfaction, and robustness under perturbations. Feature tables and
comparisons yield practical guidance for solver selection, underscoring
trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency. Our findings emphasize
the synergy between solver, task, and hardware, sparse IPMs for long-horizon
MPC, and dense active-set for high frequency WBC to advance agile, autonomous
legged systems, with emerging extensions to nonconvex and distributed QP.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid,

This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and
unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce
VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral
concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a
dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active
Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its
environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute
actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking
capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we
fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level
commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior.
Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E
can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible
with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate
on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing
concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more
natural and capable embodied assistants.

Abstract: Researchers have studied Stewart-Gough platforms, also known as Gough-Stewart
platforms or hexapod platforms extensively for their inherent fine control
characteristics. Their studies led to the potential deployment opportunities of
Stewart-Gough Platforms in many critical applications such as the medical
field, engineering machines, space research, electronic chip manufacturing,
automobile manufacturing, etc. Some of these applications need micro and
nano-level movement control in 3D space for the motions to be precise,
complicated, and repeatable; a Stewart-Gough platform fulfills these challenges
smartly. For this, the platform must be more accurate than the specified
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a parallel robot is
crucial. Forward kinematics-based calibration for these hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To experiment with different calibration techniques, various
calibration approaches were implemented by using external instruments,
constraining one or more motions of the system, and using extra sensors for
auto or self-calibration. This survey paid attention to those key
methodologies, their outcome, and important details related to inverse
kinematic-based parallel robot calibrations. It was observed during this study
that the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position
and orientation considering the errors contributed by one source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly kinematic and structural, in
some cases, environmental factors also are reviewed, however, those
calibrations are done under no-load conditions. This study aims to review the

We also evaluate LLMs that are fine-tuned for embodied reasoning and conclude

Abstract: Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art
results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While
diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and
video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly
transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that
by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied
AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action
distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5
neural function evaluations (NFE).
  Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy,
genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting
denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves
challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We
evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and
Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2
million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard
diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with
significantly fewer inference steps.

Abstract: Stability of bipedal systems in frontal plane is affected by the hip offset,
to the extent that adjusting stride time using feedforward retraction and
extension of the legs can lead to stable oscillations without feedback control.
This feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to reduce the control effort
and energy expenditure and increase the locomotion robustness. However, there
is limited understanding of how key parameters, such as mass, stiffness, leg
length, and hip width, affect stability and the minimum stride frequency needed
to maintain it. This study aims to address these gaps through analyzing how
individual model parameters and the system's natural frequency influence the
minimum stride frequency required to maintain a stable cycle. We propose a
method to predict the minimum stride frequency, and compare the predicted
stride frequencies with actual values for randomly generated models. The
findings of this work provide a better understanding of the frontal plane
stability mechanisms and how feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to
reduce the control effort.

Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and

Abstract: Self-balancing exoskeletons offer a promising mobility solution for
individuals with lower-limb disabilities. For reliable long-term operation,
these exoskeletons require a perception system that is effective in changing
environments. In this work, we introduce LT-Exosense, a vision-centric,
multi-session mapping system designed to support long-term (semi)-autonomous
navigation for exoskeleton users. LT-Exosense extends single-session mapping
capabilities by incrementally fusing spatial knowledge across multiple
sessions, detecting environmental changes, and updating a persistent global
map. This representation enables intelligent path planning, which can adapt to
newly observed obstacles and can recover previous routes when obstructions are
removed. We validate LT-Exosense through several real-world experiments,
demonstrating a scalable multi-session map that achieves an average
point-to-point error below 5 cm when compared to ground-truth laser scans. We
also illustrate the potential application of adaptive path planning in
dynamically changing indoor environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have emerged as powerful robot policies,
enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to generalize across diverse
scenes and instructions. Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high
generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations:
jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action
coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures
that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial.
In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a
training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and
thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and
real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts
success rates across diverse manipulation tasks. Code and project page are

TL;DR: NeuroSymLand是一个神经符号框架，结合离线LLM生成和在线语义分割与符号推理，用于无人机在非结构化环境中的安全着陆。


<details>

Motivation: 无人机在非结构化环境（如杂乱、不平、地图贫乏）中的自主着陆是核心需求，但纯视觉或深度学习模型在协变量偏移下表现不佳且缺乏可解释性。

Method: NeuroSymLand包含两条紧密耦合的流水线：(i)离线流水线使用LLM和人工细化从多样化着陆场景生成可验证的符号知识；(ii)在线流水线通过轻量级基础模型生成概率事实，构建语义场景图进行实时演绎推理。节点属性和边关系通过几何例程计算而非学习，避免数据依赖。

Result: NeuroSymLand在数据集、多样化模拟地图和真实无人机硬件上的广泛评估显示，其相比现有基准方法具有更高准确性、更强的协变量偏移鲁棒性和更优效率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合基础模型的感知能力和符号推理的可解释性，显著提升了无人机在应急响应、监视和配送任务中的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous landing in unstructured (cluttered, uneven, and map-poor)
environments is a core requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet
purely vision-based or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift
and provide limited interpretability. We propose NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic
framework that tightly couples two complementary pipelines: (i) an offline
pipeline, where Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop refinement
synthesize Scallop code from diverse landing scenarios, distilling
generalizable and verifiable symbolic knowledge; and (ii) an online pipeline,
where a compact foundation-based semantic segmentation model generates
probabilistic Scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for
real-time deductive reasoning. This design combines the perceptual strengths of
lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of
symbolic reasoning. Node attributes (e.g., flatness, area) and edge relations
(adjacency, containment, proximity) are computed with geometric routines rather
than learned, avoiding the data dependence and latency of train-time graph
builders. The resulting Scallop program encodes landing principles (avoid water
and obstacles; prefer large, flat, accessible regions) and yields calibrated
safety scores with ranked Regions of Interest (ROIs) and human-readable
justifications. Extensive evaluations across datasets, diverse simulation maps,
and real UAV hardware show that NeuroSymLand achieves higher accuracy, stronger
robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared with
state-of-the-art baselines, while advancing UAV safety and reliability in
emergency response, surveillance, and delivery missions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO) in
dynamic environments, where conventional methods often fail due to their
static-world assumptions. Traditional LIO algorithms perform poorly when
dynamic objects dominate the scenes, particularly in geometrically sparse
environments. Current approaches to dynamic LIO face a fundamental challenge:
accurate localization requires a reliable identification of static features,
yet distinguishing dynamic objects necessitates precise pose estimation. Our
solution breaks this circular dependency by integrating dynamic awareness
directly into the point cloud registration process. We introduce a novel
dynamic-aware iterative closest point algorithm that leverages spatio-temporal
normal analysis, complemented by an efficient spatial consistency verification
method to enhance static map construction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LIO systems in
challenging dynamic environments with limited geometric structure. The code and

Abstract: Humanoid robots represent a central frontier in embodied intelligence, as
their anthropomorphic form enables natural deployment in humans' workspace.
Brain-body co-design for humanoids presents a promising approach to realizing
this potential by jointly optimizing control policies and physical morphology.
Within this context, fall recovery emerges as a critical capability. It not
only enhances safety and resilience but also integrates naturally with
locomotion systems, thereby advancing the autonomy of humanoids. In this paper,
we propose RoboCraft, a scalable humanoid co-design framework for fall recovery
that iteratively improves performance through the coupled updates of control
policy and morphology. A shared policy pretrained across multiple designs is
progressively finetuned on high-performing morphologies, enabling efficient
adaptation without retraining from scratch. Concurrently, morphology search is
guided by human-inspired priors and optimization algorithms, supported by a
priority buffer that balances reevaluation of promising candidates with the
exploration of novel designs. Experiments show that \ourmethod{} achieves an
average performance gain of 44.55% on seven public humanoid robots, with
morphology optimization drives at least 40% of improvements in co-designing
four humanoid robots, underscoring the critical role of humanoid co-design.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for accurately estimating the
3D shape of flexible continuum robots subjected to external loads. The proposed
method introduces a spatiotemporal neural network architecture that fuses
multi-modal inputs, including current and historical tendon displacement data
and RGB images, to generate point clouds representing the robot's deformed
configuration. The network integrates a recurrent neural module for temporal
feature extraction, an encoding module for spatial feature extraction, and a
multi-modal fusion module to combine spatial features extracted from visual
data with temporal dependencies from historical actuator inputs. Continuous 3D
shape reconstruction is achieved by fitting B\'ezier curves to the predicted
point clouds. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
high precision, with mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and
0.22 mm (loaded), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in shape sensing for
TDCRs. The results validate the efficacy of deep learning-based spatiotemporal
data fusion for precise shape estimation under loading conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining-driven
Fused State Representation in Proximal Policy Optimization (BLIP-FusePPO), a
novel multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous
lane-keeping (LK), in which semantic embeddings generated by a vision-language
model (VLM) are directly fused with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and
Proportional-Integral-Derivative-based (PID) control feedback within the agent
observation space. The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that
are aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level
scene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals.
Our architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware
representations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function
that includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed
regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable. Our method is
different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards.
Instead, it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation.
This cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic
guidance is always available. The simulation results show that the proposed
model is better at LK stability and adaptability than the best vision-based and
multimodal RL baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations. We
make our code publicly available.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional stochastic systems, critical in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and hyperchaotic systems, faces the curse of
dimensionality, lacks temporal abstraction, and often fails to ensure
stochastic stability. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces the
Multi-Timescale Lyapunov-Constrained Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
(MTLHRL) framework. MTLHRL integrates a hierarchical policy within a
semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), featuring a high-level policy for
strategic planning and a low-level policy for reactive control, which
effectively manages complex, multi-timescale decision-making and reduces
dimensionality overhead. Stability is rigorously enforced using a neural
Lyapunov function optimized via Lagrangian relaxation and multi-timescale
actor-critic updates, ensuring mean-square boundedness or asymptotic stability
in the face of stochastic dynamics. The framework promotes efficient and
reliable learning through trust-region constraints and decoupled optimization.
Extensive simulations on an 8D hyperchaotic system and a 5-DOF robotic
manipulator demonstrate MTLHRL's empirical superiority. It significantly
outperforms baseline methods in both stability and performance, recording the
lowest error indices (e.g., Integral Absolute Error (IAE): 3.912 in
hyperchaotic control and IAE: 1.623 in robotics), achieving faster convergence,
and exhibiting superior disturbance rejection. MTLHRL offers a theoretically
grounded and practically viable solution for robust control of complex
stochastic systems.

Unlike other areas of research, the scientific community has not yet achieved
an agreement on how Social Robot Navigation should be benchmarked. This is
notably important, as the lack of a de facto standard to benchmark Social Robot
Navigation can hinder the progress of the field and may lead to contradicting
conclusions. Motivated by this gap, we contribute with a short review focused
exclusively on benchmarking trends in the period from January 2020 to July
2025. Of the 130 papers identified by our search using IEEE Xplore, we analysed
the 85 papers that met the criteria of the review. This review addresses the
metrics used in the literature for benchmarking purposes, the algorithms
employed in such benchmarks, the use of human surveys for benchmarking, and how
conclusions are drawn from the benchmarking results, when applicable.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to generate feasible, unique forward-kinematic
solutions for a general Stewart platform. This is done by using inverse
kinematics to obtain valid workspace data and corresponding actuator lengths
for the moving platform. For parallel kinematic machines, such as the Stewart
Platform, inverse kinematics are straight forward, but the forward kinematics
are complex and generates multiple solutions due to the closed loop structure
of the kinematic links. In this research, a simple iterative algorithm has been
used employing modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention. The outcome is
encouraging as this method generates a single feasible forward kinematic
solution for each valid pose with the solved DH parameters and unlike earlier
forward kinematics solutions, this unique solution does not need to be manually
verified. Therefore, the forward kinematic solutions can be used directly for
further calculations without the need for manual pose verification. This
capability is essential for the six degree of freedom materials testing system
developed by the authors in their laboratory. The developed system is aimed at
characterizing additively manufactured materials under complex combined
multiple loading conditions. The material characterization is done by enabling
high precision force control on the moving platform via in situ calibration of
the as-built kinematics of the Stewart Gough Platform.

Abstract: Vine robots extend their tubular bodies by everting material from the tip,
enabling navigation in complex environments with a minimalist soft body.
Despite their promise for field applications, especially in the urban search
and rescue domain, performance is constrained by the weight of attached sensors
or tools, as well as other design and control choices. This work investigates
how tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method shape vine
robot steerability--the ability to maneuver with controlled curvature--for
robots that steer with series pouch motor-style pneumatic actuators. We conduct
two groups of experiments: (1) studying tip load, chamber pressure, length, and
diameter in a robot supporting itself against gravity, and (2) studying
fabrication method and ratio of actuator to chamber pressure in a robot
supported on the ground. Results show that steerability decreases with
increasing tip load, is best at moderate chamber pressure, increases with
length, and is largely unaffected by diameter. Robots with actuators attached
on their exterior begin curving at low pressure ratios, but curvature saturates
at high pressure ratios; those with actuators integrated into the robot body
require higher pressure ratios to begin curving but achieve higher curvature
overall. We demonstrate that robots optimized with these principles outperform
those with ad hoc parameters in a mobility task that involves maximizing upward
and horizontal curvatures.

Conclusion: 结合FSM及DQN的分散式控制器能够更有效地在异构机器人群体中实现动态空间分离，其性能显著优于纯FSM控制器。

Abstract: In natural systems, emergent structures often arise to balance competing
demands. Army ants, for example, form temporary "walls" that prevent
interference between foraging trails. Inspired by this behavior, we developed
two decentralized controllers for heterogeneous robotic swarms to maintain
spatial separation while executing concurrent tasks. The first is a
finite-state machine (FSM)-based controller that uses encounter-triggered
transitions to create rigid, stable walls. The second integrates FSM states
with a Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamically optimizing separation through emergent
"demilitarized zones." In simulation, both controllers reduce mixing between
subgroups, with the DQN-enhanced controller improving adaptability and reducing
mixing by 40-50% while achieving faster convergence.

Abstract: This paper introduces SPIRAL (Self-Play Incremental Racing Algorithm for

incrementally cultivate complex racing behaviors within a challenging, dynamic

increasingly proficient versions of themselves, naturally escalating the
difficulty of competitive interactions. This progressive learning journey
guides agents from mastering fundamental flight control to executing
sophisticated cooperative multi-drone racing strategies. Our method is designed
for versatility, allowing integration with any state-of-the-art Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms within its self-play framework.
Simulations demonstrate the significant advantages of SPIRAL and benchmark the
performance of various DRL algorithms operating within it. Consequently, we
contribute a versatile, scalable, and self-improving learning framework to the
field of autonomous drone racing. SPIRAL's capacity to autonomously generate
appropriate and escalating challenges through its self-play dynamic offers a

Abstract: The coordination of multiple autonomous agents in high-speed, competitive

presents CRUISE (Curriculum-Based Iterative Self-Play for Scalable Multi-Drone

Validated in high-fidelity simulation with realistic quadrotor dynamics, the
resulting policies significantly outperform both a standard reinforcement

achieves nearly double the planner's mean racing speed, maintains high success
rates, and demonstrates robust scalability as agent density increases. Ablation

this performance leap. By providing a scalable and effective training
methodology, CRUISE advances the development of autonomous systems for dynamic,

Abstract: The reliability of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is severely
constrained in environments where visual inputs suffer from noise and low
illumination. Although recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based SLAM
frameworks achieve high-fidelity mapping under clean conditions, they remain
vulnerable to compounded degradations that degrade mapping and tracking
performance. A key observation underlying our work is that the original 3DGS
rendering pipeline inherently behaves as an implicit low-pass filter,
attenuating high-frequency noise but also risking over-smoothing. Building on
this insight, we propose RoGER-SLAM, a robust 3DGS SLAM system tailored for
noise and low-light resilience. The framework integrates three innovations: a
Structure-Preserving Robust Fusion (SP-RoFusion) mechanism that couples
rendered appearance, depth, and edge cues; an adaptive tracking objective with
residual balancing regularization; and a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP)-based enhancement module, selectively activated under compounded
degradations to restore semantic and structural fidelity. Comprehensive
experiments on Replica, TUM, and real-world sequences show that RoGER-SLAM
consistently improves trajectory accuracy and reconstruction quality compared
with other 3DGS-SLAM systems, especially under adverse imaging conditions.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception systems have advanced rapidly in recent
years, providing vehicles with the ability to accurately interpret their
environment. Perception systems remain susceptible to errors caused by
overly-confident predictions in the case of rare events or out-of-sample data.
This study equips an autonomous vehicle with the ability to 'know when it is
uncertain', using an uncertainty-aware image classifier as part of the AV
software stack. Specifically, the study exploits the ability of Random-Set
Neural Networks (RS-NNs) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty. Unlike
traditional CNNs or Bayesian methods, RS-NNs predict belief functions over sets
of classes, allowing the system to identify and signal uncertainty clearly in
novel or ambiguous scenarios. The system is tested in a real-world autonomous
racing vehicle software stack, with the RS-NN classifying the layout of the
road ahead and providing the associated uncertainty of the prediction.
Performance of the RS-NN under a range of road conditions is compared against
traditional CNN and Bayesian neural networks, with the RS-NN achieving
significantly higher accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration. This
integration of RS-NNs into Robot Operating System (ROS)-based vehicle control
pipeline demonstrates that predictive uncertainty can dynamically modulate
vehicle speed, maintaining high-speed performance under confident predictions
while proactively improving safety through speed reductions in uncertain
scenarios. These results demonstrate the potential of uncertainty-aware neural
networks - in particular RS-NNs - as a practical solution for safer and more
robust autonomous driving.

Abstract: This paper presents environment-adaptive pinch-lifting built on a

fingers: SCAL-R, a rotational-drive design with an active fingertip that folds
inward after contact to form an envelope, and SCAL-L, a linear-drive design
that passively opens on contact to span wide or weak-feature objects. Both
fingers convert surface following into an upward lifting branch while
maintaining fingertip orientation, enabling thin or low-profile targets to be
raised from supports with minimal sensing and control. Two-finger grippers are
fabricated via PLA-based 3D printing. Experiments evaluate (i)
contact-preserving sliding and pinch-lifting on tabletops, (ii) ramp
negotiation followed by lift, and (iii) handling of bulky objects via active
enveloping (SCAL-R) or contact-triggered passive opening (SCAL-L). Across
dozens of trials on small parts, boxes, jars, and tape rolls, both designs
achieve consistent grasps with limited tuning. A quasi-static analysis provides
closed-form fingertip-force models for linear parallel pinching and two-point
enveloping, offering geometry-aware guidance for design and operation. Overall,
the results indicate complementary operating regimes and a practical path to
robust, environment-adaptive grasping with simple actuation.

framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed
PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where
each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner
decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent
edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating
to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid
policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local
graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to
produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a
comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5%
more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing
inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication
allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger
robot teams without any retraining. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative SLAM often encounters challenges in similar indoor
environments characterized by repetitive structures, such as corridors and
rooms. These challenges can lead to significant inaccuracies in shared location
identification when employing point cloud-based techniques. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce TWC-SLAM, a multi-agent cooperative SLAM framework that
integrates text semantics and WiFi signal features to enhance location
identification and loop closure detection. TWC-SLAM comprises a single-agent
front-end odometry module based on FAST-LIO2, a location identification and
loop closure detection module that leverages text semantics and WiFi features,
and a global mapping module. The agents are equipped with sensors capable of
capturing textual information and detecting WiFi signals. By correlating these
data sources, TWC-SLAM establishes a common location, facilitating point cloud
alignment across different agents' maps. Furthermore, the system employs loop
closure detection and optimization modules to achieve global optimization and
cohesive mapping. We evaluated our approach using an indoor dataset featuring
similar corridors, rooms, and text signs. The results demonstrate that TWC-SLAM
significantly improves the performance of cooperative SLAM systems in complex
environments with repetitive architectural features.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires
translating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description
Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches
struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor
scalability, and low coordination efficiency.
  We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists
of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based
robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the
command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level
plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a
subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a
dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a
dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each
subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem,
explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot
capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from
assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition
and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM
improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and
achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Accurate full-body motion prediction is essential for the safe, autonomous
navigation of legged robots, enabling critical capabilities like limb-level
collision checking in cluttered environments. Simplified kinematic models often
fail to capture the complex, closed-loop dynamics of the robot and its
low-level controller, limiting their predictions to simple planar motion. To
address this, we present a learning-based observer-predictor framework that
accurately predicts this motion. Our method features a neural observer with
provable UUB guarantees that provides a reliable latent state estimate from a
history of proprioceptive measurements. This stable estimate initializes a
computationally efficient predictor, designed for the rapid, parallel
evaluation of thousands of potential trajectories required by modern
sampling-based planners. We validated the system by integrating our neural
predictor into an MPPI-based planner on a Vision 60 quadruped. Hardware
experiments successfully demonstrated effective, limb-aware motion planning in
a challenging, narrow passage and over small objects, highlighting our system's
ability to provide a robust foundation for high-performance, collision-aware
planning on dynamic robotic platforms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Swarm robotics has potential for a wide variety of applications, but
real-world deployments remain rare due to the difficulty of predicting emergent
behaviors arising from simple local interactions. Traditional engineering
approaches design controllers to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes under
idealized conditions, while agent-based and artificial life studies explore
emergent phenomena in a bottom-up, exploratory manner. In this work, we
introduce Analytical Swarm Chemistry, a framework that integrates concepts from
engineering, agent-based and artificial life research, and chemistry. This
framework combines macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis to
systematically explore how swarm parameters influence emergent behavior.
Inspired by concepts from chemistry, the framework treats parameters like
thermodynamic variables, enabling visualization of regions in parameter space
that give rise to specific behaviors. Applying this framework to agents with
minimally viable capabilities, we identify sufficient conditions for behaviors
such as milling and diffusion and uncover regions of the parameter space that
reliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary validation on real robots
demonstrates that these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice.
By providing a principled, interpretable approach, this framework lays the
groundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm
systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: To enlarge the translational workspace of cable-driven robots, one common
approach is to increase the number of cables. However, this introduces two
challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational
workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique,
resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we
design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By
incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative
linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative
rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism.
Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree
of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion
can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing
and control.

Abstract: Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet
conventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to
perturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables
compliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint
torques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among
virtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task
objectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive VMC with
Large Language Model (LLM)- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL),
which preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting
stability-guaranteed online adaptation. The LLM provides structured priors and
high-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components,
improve sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task
requirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability
constraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive
simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively
balances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance
while highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and
Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.

Abstract: Objective-oriented navigation(ObjNav) enables robot to navigate to target
object directly and autonomously in an unknown environment. Effective
perception in navigation in unknown environment is critical for autonomous
robots. While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local
information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav.
Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom
integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact
that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of
Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation
(HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding
capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance
the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In
both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods
achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting
from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the
objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information
understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map. Our ablation
study further proved that either of the hybrid perception contributes to the
navigation performance.

an LQR scheme, compensates for the platform's nonlinear dynamics to achieve
precise motion control. In parallel, an Extended Kalman Filter fuses IMU and
actuator encoder feedback to provide accurate and reliable state estimation
under sensor noise and external disturbances. Unlike prior efforts that
emphasize only isolated aspects such as modeling or control, this work delivers
a complete hardware-software platform validated through both simulation and
experiments on static and dynamic trajectories. Results demonstrate effective
trajectory tracking and real-time state estimation, highlighting the platform's

computer vision, robotic control, and real-time stabilization technologies via
a multi-sensor fusion approach. A lightweight YOLO model, deployed on an

configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with
a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the
STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can
stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response
time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural
environments (standard greenhouse, hilly terrain, complex lighting) demonstrate
a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood
irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in robot
bimanual skill learning. However, existing methods ignore the learning of
posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm
configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous
bimanual manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose
Manipulability-Aware Diffusion Policy (ManiDP), a novel imitation learning
method that not only generates plausible bimanual trajectories, but also
optimizes dual-arm configurations to better satisfy posture-dependent task
requirements. ManiDP achieves this by extracting bimanual manipulability from
expert demonstrations and encoding the encapsulated posture features using
Riemannian-based probabilistic models. These encoded posture features are then
incorporated into a conditional diffusion process to guide the generation of
task-compatible bimanual motion sequences. We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world
bimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33$\%$ increase
in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task
compatibility compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the importance
of integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion to
enable human-like adaptability and dexterity.

Abstract: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model
for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances
intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating
multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The
model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving
richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on
edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while
maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy
IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS
positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both
road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative
and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control
in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves
competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only
heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas.
Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to
more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we
will release the codes to our GitHub repository at

Abstract: The facial expression generation capability of humanoid social robots is
critical for achieving natural and human-like interactions, playing a vital
role in enhancing the fluidity of human-robot interactions and the accuracy of
emotional expression. Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid
social robots still relies on pre-programmed behavioral patterns, which are
manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to
autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop
the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address
this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with
physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning
framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms.
Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an
automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion
primitives to construct the dataset. Notably, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots.
Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our approach achieves accurate and
diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Orographic soaring can significantly extend the endurance of micro aerial
vehicles (MAVs), but circling behavior, arising from control conflicts between
the longitudinal and vertical axes, increases energy consumption and the risk
of divergence. We propose a control switching method, named SAOS: Switched
Control for Autonomous Orographic Soaring, which mitigates circling behavior by
selectively controlling either the horizontal or vertical axis, effectively
transforming the system from underactuated to fully actuated during soaring.
Additionally, the angle of attack is incorporated into the INDI controller to
improve force estimation. Simulations with randomized initial positions and
wind tunnel experiments on two MAVs demonstrate that the SAOS improves position
convergence, reduces throttle usage, and mitigates roll oscillations caused by
pitch-roll coupling. These improvements enhance energy efficiency and flight
stability in constrained soaring environments.

Abstract: This paper deals with the design of a cost effective automated tape laying

necessary compaction forces as well as with an accurate temperature control to
guarantee the used tape being melted appropriate. It is crucial to control the
substrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an
optimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore,
it takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is
finally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into
the tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a
heating zone and the consolidation unit. Moreover, a special robot control
concept for testing the ATL system is presented. In contrast to many other
systems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the
shape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather
compact and complex shapes. The functionality of the subsystems and the taping
process itself was finally approved in experimental results using a carbon
fiber reinforced HDPE tape.

Abstract: Enabling robots to dexterously grasp and manipulate objects based on human

challenging to generalize across diverse objects or tasks due to the limited
scale of semantic dexterous grasp datasets. Foundation models offer a new way
to enhance generalization, yet directly leveraging them to generate feasible
robotic actions remains challenging due to the gap between abstract model
knowledge and physical robot execution. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDexGrasp, a generalizable framework that achieves omni-capabilities in user
prompting, dexterous embodiment, and grasping tasks by combining foundation
models with the transfer and control strategies. OmniDexGrasp integrates three
key modules: (i) foundation models are used to enhance generalization by
generating human grasp images supporting omni-capability of user prompt and
task; (ii) a human-image-to-robot-action transfer strategy converts human
demonstrations into executable robot actions, enabling omni dexterous
embodiment; (iii) force-aware adaptive grasp strategy ensures robust and stable
grasp execution. Experiments in simulation and on real robots validate the
effectiveness of OmniDexGrasp on diverse user prompts, grasp task and dexterous
hands, and further results show its extensibility to dexterous manipulation
tasks.

Abstract: Learned robot policies have consistently been shown to be versatile, but they
typically have no built-in mechanism for handling the complexity of open
environments, making them prone to execution failures; this implies that
deploying policies without the ability to recognise and react to failures may
lead to unreliable and unsafe robot behaviour. In this paper, we present a
framework that couples a learned policy with a method to detect visual
anomalies during policy deployment and to perform recovery behaviours when
necessary, thereby aiming to prevent failures. Specifically, we train an
anomaly detection model using data collected during nominal executions of a
trained policy. This model is then integrated into the online policy execution
process, so that deviations from the nominal execution can trigger a
three-level sequential recovery process that consists of (i) pausing the
execution temporarily, (ii) performing a local perturbation of the robot's
state, and (iii) resetting the robot to a safe state by sampling from a learned
execution success model. We verify our proposed method in two different
scenarios: (i) a door handle reaching task with a Kinova Gen3 arm using a
policy trained in simulation and transferred to the real robot, and (ii) an
object placing task with a UFactory xArm 6 using a general-purpose policy
model. Our results show that integrating policy execution with anomaly
detection and recovery increases the execution success rate in environments
with various anomalies, such as trajectory deviations and adversarial human
interventions.

Abstract: The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial

compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for
each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive
Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories,
accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe,
collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to
disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the
method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic
conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even
under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for
computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment
in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.

Abstract: This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more
likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as
value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We
designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots
- one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a
labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that
participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one.
Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one
robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the
Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more
loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its
perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the
participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and
participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots
expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand,
this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate
users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that
social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users
avoid scams.

Abstract: Resourceful operation and design of robots is key for sustainable industrial
automation. This will be enabled by lightweight design along with time and
energy optimal control of robotic manipulators. Design and control of such
systems is intertwined as the control must take into account inherent
mechanical compliance while the design must accommodate the dynamic
requirements demanded by the control. As basis for such design optimization, a
method for estimating the lifetime of elastic link robotic manipulators is
presented. This is applied to the geometry optimization of flexible serial
manipulators performing pick-and-place operations, where the optimization
objective is a combination of overall weight and vibration amplitudes. The
lifetime estimation draws from a fatigue analysis combining the rainflow
counting algorithm and the method of critical cutting plane. Tresca hypothesis
is used to formulate an equivalent stress, and linear damage accumulation is
assumed. The final robot geometry is selected from a Pareto front as a tradeoff
of lifetime and vibration characteristic. The method is illustrated for a three
degrees of freedom articulated robotic manipulator.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration
to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in
order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the
free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by
minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and
extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework
that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale
recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy
generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their
long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection
that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our
framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the
baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results
highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and
goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.

Abstract: In multi-sensor systems, time synchronization between sensors is a
significant challenge, and this issue is particularly pronounced in underwater
integrated navigation systems incorporating acoustic positioning. Such systems
are highly susceptible to time delay, which can significantly degrade accuracy
when measurement and fusion moments are misaligned. To address this challenge,
this paper introduces a tightly coupled navigation framework that integrates a
passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) acoustic positioning system, a
strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), and a depth gauge under precise
time synchronization. The framework fuses azimuth and slant range from the
piUSBL with depth data, thereby avoiding poor vertical-angle observability in
planar arrays. A novel delay measurement strategy is introduced, combining
synchronized timing with acoustic signal processing, which redefines
delay-traditionally an unobservable error-into a quantifiable parameter,
enabling explicit estimation of both acoustic propagation and system processing
delays. Simulations and field experiments confirm the feasibility of the
proposed method, with delay-compensated navigation reducing RMSE by 40.45% and
maximum error by 32.55%. These findings show that precise delay measurement and
compensation not only enhance underwater navigation accuracy but also establish
a generalizable framework for acoustic positioning integration, offering
valuable insights into time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive
multi-sensor systems.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments is essential for field and
planetary robotics, where robots must efficiently reach goals while avoiding
obstacles under uncertain conditions. Conventional algorithmic approaches often
require extensive environment-specific tuning, limiting scalability to new
domains. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides a data-driven alternative,
allowing robots to acquire navigation strategies through direct interactions
with their environment. This work investigates the feasibility of DRL policy
generalization across visually and topographically distinct simulated domains,
where policies are trained in terrestrial settings and validated in a zero-shot
manner in extraterrestrial environments. A 3D simulation of an agricultural
rover is developed and trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to
achieve goal-directed navigation and obstacle avoidance in farmland settings.
The learned policy is then evaluated in a lunar-like simulated environment to
assess transfer performance. The results indicate that policies trained under
terrestrial conditions retain a high level of effectiveness, achieving close to
50\% success in lunar simulations without the need for additional training and
fine-tuning. This underscores the potential of cross-domain DRL-based policy
transfer as a promising approach to developing adaptable and efficient
autonomous navigation for future planetary exploration missions, with the added
benefit of minimizing retraining costs.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and robotics,
service robots are increasingly becoming an integral part of daily life,
offering a wide range of services in complex environments. To deliver these
services intelligently and efficiently, robust and accurate task planning
capabilities are essential. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the
integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their
role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and
foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We
then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service
robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and
decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning
across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio,
and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in
current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning
capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments.
This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and
practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the inconsistency problem
caused by observability mismatch in visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS).
The key idea involves applying a linear time-varying transformation to the
error-state within the Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). This transformation
ensures that \textrr{the unobservable subspace of the transformed error-state
system} becomes independent of the state, thereby preserving the correct
observability of the transformed system against variations in linearization
points. We introduce the Transformed ESKF (T-ESKF), a consistent VINS estimator
that performs state estimation using the transformed error-state system.
Furthermore, we develop an efficient propagation technique to accelerate the
covariance propagation based on the transformation relationship between the
transition and accumulated matrices of T-ESKF and ESKF. We validate the
proposed method through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating
better (or competitive at least) performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at github.com/HITCSC/T-ESKF.

Abstract: Heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators (HHMs) operate under strict physical and
safety-critical constraints due to their large size, high power, and complex
nonlinear dynamics. Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector
trajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force,
velocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation,
yet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper
presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to
guarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of
HHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed
method combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback,
and is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual
decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation
on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only
enforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures
constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These
results demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory
tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new
benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.

Abstract: To understand and collaborate with humans, robots must account for individual
human traits, habits, and activities over time. However, most robotic
assistants lack these abilities, as they primarily focus on predefined tasks in
structured environments and lack a human model to learn from. This work
introduces COOPERA, a novel framework for COntinual, OPen-Ended human-Robot
Assistance, where simulated humans, driven by psychological traits and
long-term intentions, interact with robots in complex environments. By
integrating continuous human feedback, our framework, for the first time,
enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration (HRC) in
different collaborative tasks across various time-scales. Within COOPERA, we
introduce a benchmark and an approach to personalize the robot's collaborative
actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents. Experiments
validate the extent to which our simulated humans reflect realistic human
behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human

Abstract: Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for
reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces.
However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and
unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical
grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a
socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a
structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM
consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that
captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the
environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a
multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot
to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and
physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,
collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or
fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling
interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves
success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded
environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal
reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation. Additional experimental

Abstract: Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to
their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system
recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the
introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing
tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers,
providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden
in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that
enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping
despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on
lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning
models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset
to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in
vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than
individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions,
supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We
demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing
compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the
art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future
intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our
method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for
fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and
paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

Abstract: Remembering where object segments were predicted in the past is useful for
improving the accuracy and consistency of class-agnostic video segmentation
algorithms. Existing video segmentation algorithms typically use either no
object-level memory (e.g. FastSAM) or they use implicit memories in the form of
recurrent neural network features (e.g. SAM2). In this paper, we augment both
types of segmentation models using an explicit 3D memory and show that the
resulting models have more accurate and consistent predictions. For this, we
develop an online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to store predicted
object-level segments generated throughout the duration of a video. Based on
this 3DGS representation, a set of fusion techniques are developed, named
FastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat, that use the explicit 3DGS memory to improve
their respective foundation models' predictions. Ablation experiments are used
to validate the proposed techniques' design and hyperparameter settings.
Results from both real-world and simulated benchmarking experiments show that
models which use explicit 3D memories result in more accurate and consistent
predictions than those which use no memory or only implicit neural network
memories. Project Page: https://topipari.com/projects/FastSAM-Splat/

Abstract: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing
diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable
evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally
constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to
reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train
and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models
trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments.
As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify,
since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of
execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework
that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale
simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging
advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and
differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video
demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts.
Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated
VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from
crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup,
resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To
measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along
multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy
generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously
evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot
manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's
robotics landscape.

Abstract: Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable
navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon
route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic
and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation
methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective
urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:
low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and
high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we
propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework
designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy
route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently
plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels
of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories
parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on
a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety
and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA
surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban.
Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both
scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world
uncertainties.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) based on uncrewed aerial
vehicles (UAVs) offer high mobility, flexibility, and coverage for urban
communications, they face severe signal attenuation in dense environments due
to obstructions. To address this critical issue, we consider introducing
collaborative beamforming (CB) of UAVs and omnidirectional reconfigurable
beamforming (ORB) of simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) to enhance the signal quality and
directionality. On this basis, we formulate a joint rate and energy
optimization problem (JREOP) to maximize the transmission rate of the overall
system, while minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV swarm. Due to the
non-convex and NP-hard nature of JREOP, we propose a heterogeneous multi-agent
collaborative dynamic (HMCD) optimization framework, which has two core
components. The first component is a simulated annealing (SA)-based STAR-RIS
control method, which dynamically optimizes reflection and transmission
coefficients to enhance signal propagation. The second component is an improved
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) control method, which
incorporates a self-attention evaluation mechanism to capture interactions
between UAVs and an adaptive velocity transition mechanism to enhance training
stability. Simulation results demonstrate that HMCD outperforms various
baselines in terms of convergence speed, average transmission rate, and energy
consumption. Further analysis reveals that the average transmission rate of the
overall system scales positively with both UAV count and STAR-RIS element
numbers.

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) represent a promising architecture
that integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial nodes to provide
enhanced coverage, reliability, and throughput for diverse applications.
However, these networks face significant security vulnerabilities from both
known and potential unknown eavesdroppers, which may threaten data
confidentiality and system integrity. To solve this critical issue, we propose
a novel secure communication framework for LAWNs where the selected UAVs within
a swarm function as a virtual antenna array (VAA), complemented by intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS) to create a robust defense against eavesdropping
attacks. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that
simultaneously maximizes the secrecy rate while minimizing the maximum sidelobe
level and total energy consumption, requiring joint optimization of UAV
excitation current weights, flight trajectories, and IRS phase shifts. This
problem presents significant difficulties due to the dynamic nature of the
system and heterogeneous components. Thus, we first transform the problem into
a heterogeneous Markov decision process (MDP). Then, we propose a heterogeneous
multi-agent control approach (HMCA) that integrates a dedicated IRS control
policy with a multi-agent soft actor-critic framework for UAV control, which
enables coordinated operation across heterogeneous network elements. Simulation
results show that the proposed HMCA achieves superior performance compared to
baseline approaches in terms of secrecy rate improvement, sidelobe suppression,
and energy efficiency. Furthermore, we find that the collaborative and passive
beamforming synergy between VAA and IRS creates robust security guarantees when
the number of UAVs increases.

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has been extensively studied for

still needs to be explored. This study presents a novel approach to biometric
authentication using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) data for palm

custom-built box with antenna power reduced to 1dBm, which was used to capture
CSI data from the right hands of 20 participants (10 men and 10 women). The
dataset was normalized using MinMax scaling to ensure uniformity and accuracy.
By focusing on biophysical aspects such as hand size, shape, angular spread
between fingers, and finger phalanx lengths, among other characteristics, the
study explores how these features affect electromagnetic signals, which are
then reflected in Wi-Fi CSI, allowing for precise user identification. Five
classification algorithms were evaluated, with the Random Forest classifier
achieving an average F1-Score of 99.82\% using 10-fold cross-validation.
Amplitude and Phase data were used, with each capture session recording
approximately 1000 packets per second in five 5-second intervals for each User.
This high accuracy highlights the potential of Wi-Fi CSI in developing robust
and reliable user authentication systems based on palm biometric data.

Abstract: Forecasting on widely used benchmark time series data (e.g., ETT,
Electricity, Taxi, and Exchange Rate, etc.) has favored smooth, seasonal
series, but network telemetry time series -- traffic measurements at service,
IP, or subnet granularity -- are instead highly bursty and intermittent, with
heavy-tailed bursts and highly variable inactive periods. These properties
place the latter in the statistical regimes made famous and popularized more
than 20 years ago by B.~Mandelbrot. Yet forecasting such time series with
modern-day AI architectures remains underexplored. We introduce NetBurst, an
event-centric framework that reformulates forecasting as predicting when bursts
occur and how large they are, using quantile-based codebooks and dual
autoregressors. Across large-scale sets of production network telemetry time
series and compared to strong baselines, such as Chronos, NetBurst reduces Mean
Average Scaled Error (MASE) by 13--605x on service-level time series while
preserving burstiness and producing embeddings that cluster 5x more cleanly
than Chronos. In effect, our work highlights the benefits that modern AI can
reap from leveraging Mandelbrot's pioneering studies for forecasting in bursty,
intermittent, and heavy-tailed regimes, where its operational value for
high-stakes decision making is of paramount interest.

Abstract: In this research, we investigate the feasibility of adopting the Bottleneck
Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR) protocol as the default
congestion control mechanism for TCP. Our central question is whether BBR,
particularly its latest iterations, BBRv2 and BBRv3, can outperform traditional
TCP variants such as Reno and Cubic across diverse networking environments. We
evaluated performance trade-offs in Internet, data center, Ethernet, wireless,
and satellite networks, comparing BBR against protocols including DCTCP, DCQCN,
TIMELY, HPCC, Swift, and congestion control schemes designed for low-Earth
orbit satellite networks, using both experiments and previous studies. Our
findings show that BBR consistently achieves high throughput across all
environments, with especially strong performance and fairness in scenarios
involving homogeneous BBR flows or high bandwidth Internet paths. Experiments
with Google and other websites over a 100~Mbps home network further confirm
BBR's superior performance and its ability to co-exist with Cubic flows. In
another experiment on the Marist campus (1--10~Gbps network), we observed its
latency characteristics compared to Cubic. Moreover, a controlled evaluation
between protocols reveals that BBR achieves the highest throughput ($\approx
905$~Mbps) but introduces higher latency ($\approx 0.79$~ms) and jitter
($\approx 4.2$~ms). In contrast, Reno and Cubic deliver balanced performance
with lower latency and moderate jitter. Vegas prioritizes minimal latency and
jitter at the cost of reduced throughput. These results demonstrate the
strength of BBR to handle bulk transfers and bandwidth-intensive applications.
However, they also emphasize the significance of workload-driven protocol
selection in latency-sensitive environments.

Motivation: 现有的BBR拥塞控制算法公平性分析模型在准确性和可解释性之间存在矛盾：动态流体模型准确但不易理解，稳态模型直观但不准确。这种矛盾在分析BBR与传统基于丢包的拥塞控制算法（如CUBIC）竞争时尤为突出，因为这种竞争常导致不稳定性（发送速率振荡）。稳态模型无法预测这种振荡，流体模型仿真又无法提供振荡条件和严重程度的分析结果。

Method: 研究人员通过控制理论扩展了BBR的最新动态流体模型，基于这种控制理论分析，推导了BBR/CUBIC振荡的定量条件，识别了易受不稳定性影响的网络设置。

Result: 分析表明这些条件在实际网络中经常得到满足，BBR/CUBIC振荡现象普遍存在并损害BBR的公平性。研究还推导并通过实验验证了反映振荡期间极端速率分布的公平性界限。

Conclusion: 研究表明BBR/CUBIC振荡频繁且损害公平性，但可以通过控制理论框架得到补救。

Abstract: To understand the fairness properties of the BBR congestion-control algorithm
(CCA), previous research has analyzed BBR behavior with a variety of models.
However, previous model-based work suffers from a trade-off between accuracy
and interpretability: While dynamic fluid models generate highly accurate
predictions through simulation, the causes of their predictions cannot be
easily understood. In contrast, steady-state models predict CCA behavior in a
manner that is intuitively understandable, but often less accurate. This
trade-off is especially consequential when analyzing the competition between
BBR and traditional loss-based CCAs, as this competition often suffers from
instability, i.e., sending-rate oscillation. Steady-state models cannot predict
this instability at all, and fluid-model simulation cannot yield analytical
results regarding preconditions and severity of the oscillation. To overcome
this trade-off, we extend the recent dynamic fluid model of BBR by means of
control theory. Based on this control-theoretic analysis, we derive
quantitative conditions for BBR/CUBIC oscillation, identify network settings
that are susceptible to instability, and find that these conditions are
frequently satisfied by practical networks. Our analysis illuminates the
fairness implications of BBR/CUBIC oscillation, namely by deriving and
experimentally validating fairness bounds that reflect the extreme rate
distributions during oscillation. In summary, our analysis shows that BBR/CUBIC
oscillation is frequent and harms BBR fairness, but can be remedied by means of
our control-theoretic framework.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive real-world measurement campaign
comparing LR-FHSS and LoRa modulations within LoRaWAN networks in urban
environments. Conducted in Halifax, Canada, the campaign used a LoRaWAN
platform capable of operating both modulations in the FCC-regulated US915 band.
Real-world measurements are crucial for capturing the effects of urban topology
and signal propagation challenges, which are difficult to fully replicate in
simulations. Results show that LR-FHSS can achieve up to a 20% improvement in
Packet Reception Rate (PRR) over traditional LoRa in dense urban areas.
Additionally, the study investigated path loss and Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI), finding that LR-FHSS achieved a minimum RSSI of -138 dBm
compared to LoRa's -120 dBm. The findings demonstrate that the introduction of
LR-FHSS enhances communication robustness and reliability under regulatory
limitations and suggest promising applications in LoRaWAN networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive measurement-based trajectory-aware
characterization of low-altitude Air-to-Ground (A2G) channels in a suburban
environment. A 64-element Massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MaMIMO) array was
used to capture channels for three trajectories of an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle
(UAV), including two horizontal zig-zag flights at fixed altitudes and one
vertical ascent, chosen to emulate AUE operations and to induce controlled
azimuth and elevation sweeps for analyzing geometry-dependent propagation
dynamics. We examine large-scale power variations and their correlation with
geometric features, such as elevation, azimuth, and 3D distance, followed by an
analysis of fading behavior through distribution fitting and Rician K-factor
estimation. Furthermore, temporal non-stationarity is quantified using the
Correlation Matrix Distance (CMD), and angular stationarity spans are utilized
to demonstrate how channel characteristics change with the movement of the UAV.
We also analyze Spectral Efficiency (SE) in relation to K-factor and Root Mean
Square (RMS) delay spread, highlighting their combined influence on link
performance. The results show that the elevation angle is the strongest
predictor of the received power, with a correlation of more than 0.77 for each
trajectory, while the Nakagami model best fits the small-scale fading. The
K-factor increases from approximately 5 dB at low altitudes to over 15 dB at
higher elevations, indicating stronger LoS dominance. Non-stationarity patterns
are highly trajectory- and geometry-dependent, with azimuth most affected in
horizontal flights and elevation during vertical flight. These findings offer
valuable insights for modeling and improving UAV communication channels in 6G
Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs).

Abstract: Network sovereignty is a network operator's ability to reduce the dependency
on component manufacturers to minimize the impact of manufacturer failures.
Network operators now face new design challenges to increase network
sovereignty and avoid vendor lock-in problems because a high dependency on a
manufacturer corresponds to low survivability if that manufacturer is
unavailable. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a novel
metric to measure network sovereignty, the Cut Set Coloring (CSC) score. Based
on the CSC core metric CSC-ILP, our Integer Linear Program formulation is
presented to maximize network sovereignty. We compare CSC-ILP's performance
with state of the art manufacturer assignment strategies.
