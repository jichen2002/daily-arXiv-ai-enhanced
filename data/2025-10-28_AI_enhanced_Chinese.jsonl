Currently, mainstream image-based\npest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine\nlearning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have\nlimitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with\ntrajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting\nin water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest\ncounting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the\ndistribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded\nindividuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the\nimpact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and\nselected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed\nsix representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle,\nspiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And\nby comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of\ndifferent stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we\ndetermined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting\nconfidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed\nstirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive\nframes as feedback to adjust the stirring speed.

While\nmachine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs)-based methods\nhave advanced the LogAD, they often suffer from limited interpretability, high\ninference costs, and extensive preprocessing requirements, limiting their\npracticality for real-time, high-volume log analysis.

In contrast, the Distributed\nTraining with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed\nlearning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and\nlimited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion\nModel Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.\nBuilt upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP\nemploys Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future\ntrajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby\nalleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE\nmethods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field\n(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This\ndesign mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with\nminimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further\ntheoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation\nerror introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence\nstability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL\nbaselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its\nscalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent studies have\nshown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate\non domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede\nenhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing\nthis issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network\n(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and\ndomain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual\nfusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are\nexploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture\nthe discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention\nfeatures are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to\nachieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and\nself-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local\nrepresentations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,\nwhich enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and\nintra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to\nevaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised\nself-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the\nsource domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift.

Predicting the\nfuture trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental\nfactors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to\nmitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic\nand unpredictable nature of construction environments.

To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and\nSemantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces\ntwo key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic\nmisalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)\nModule and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps\npedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively\ncompensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In\nparallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that\nhighlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the\nnegative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view\ncorrespondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching\nprotocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant\nimprovements of +18.8\\% in mAP and +16.8\\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous\nstate-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting.

This makes it difficult to maintain global\nnarrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is\nparticularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene\ndescription. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image\ncaptioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and\nfurther propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),\nwhich models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).\nHowever, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant\ncomputational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a\nhighly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By\nincorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value\nnetwork, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order\nof magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive\nearly stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the\nimage's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including\nDetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a\nplug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing\nVLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly\ncompetitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,\nand hallucination suppression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTDSR\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7ec6\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684MCTS\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6602\u8d35VLM\u7684\u8c03\u7528\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u83b7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTDSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9VLMs\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u5e76\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ef7\u503c\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982DetailCaps\u3001COMPOSITIONCAP\u3001POPE\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cTDSR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VLMs\uff08\u5982LLaVA-1.5\u3001Qwen2.5-VL\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "TDSR\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLMs\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic\nconsistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and\nmulti-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the\ntarget embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning\nperturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under\nadversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play\ninference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack\nsettings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP\nwhile maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs\nfor further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing\nan adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to\nbroader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To address these issues, we propose a unified\ngeometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three\ncore components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement\n(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based\nsparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with\nhigh precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the\nrefined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced\ngeometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest\nNeighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively\npreserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the\ndecoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a\nweighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of\nhigh-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.\nUGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:\n8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB.

To address\nthis, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future\ntimesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This\ntransforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model\ncontinuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio\ncues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also\nenables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead\ntarget, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the\ntemporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity\nand consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while\nsmaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human\nanimation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,\nidentity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal\nconditioning across several different architectures.
